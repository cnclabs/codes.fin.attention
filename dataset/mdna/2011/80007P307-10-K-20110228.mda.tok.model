our business segments and primary operations we operate in three business segments exploration and production  drilling and oil field services and midstream gas services 
financial information regarding each segment is provided in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
exploration and production we explore for  develop and produce oil and natural gas reserves  with a focus on increasing our reserves and production in the permian basin  mid continent and wto 
we operate substantially all of our wells in these areas 
we also operate leasehold positions in the cotton valley trend in east texas  gulf coast and gulf of mexico

our total standardized measure was billion at december  average daily net production for the month of december permian basin the arena acquisition in july continued the expansion of our holdings in the central basin platform cbp  a part of the permian basin in west texas  and added significant permian basin production from the midland and delaware basins in texas as well as the northwest shelf in new mexico 
reserves and associated production in this area are predominantly oil 
the primary reservoirs in the cbp are the dolomites and limestones of the san andres and clear fork formations 
to date  the san andres and clear fork zones have produced more than and billion barrels of oil  respectively  with well depths typically ranging from  to  feet 
our properties in the cbp are positioned for infill and step out drilling to target these reservoirs in several of the major cbp fields  such as the fuhrman mascho  goldsmith  fullerton  tex mex  martin and robertson fields 
as of december   our estimated net proved reserves in the permian basin were mmboe or  bcfe  of which were proved undeveloped reserves  based on estimates provided by our independent oil and natural gas consulting firms  lee keeling and associates  inc lee keeling and netherland  sewell associates  inc netherland sewell 
our interests in the permian basin as of december  included  gross  net producing wells with an average working interest of 
our average daily net production for the month of december was approximately mboe or mmcfe per day 
we were operating rigs in the permian basin as of december  and drilled wells in this area during mid continent we own interests in properties in oklahoma  arkansas and southern kansas that make up our mid continent area 
as of december   we held interests in  gross  net leasehold and option acres in these areas 
as of december   our estimated proved reserves in the mid continent area were mmboe or bcfe  of which were proved undeveloped reserves  based on estimates 
table of contents prepared by netherland sewell and our internal engineers 
our average daily net production for the month of december was approximately mboe or mmcfe per day 
we were operating rigs in the mid continent area as of december  and drilled or participated in the drilling of wells in this area during mississippian formation 
the mississippian formation within the mid continent area is located on the anadarko shelf in northern oklahoma and southern kansas 
the top of this expansive carbonate hydrocarbon system is encountered between  and  feet and lies stratigraphically between the pennsylvanian aged morrow sand and the devonian aged woodford shale formations 
the mississippian formation may reach  feet in gross thickness and the targeted porosity zone is between and feet in thickness 
the formation s geology is well understood as a result of the thousands of vertical wells drilled and produced there since the s 
beginning in  the application of horizontal cased hole drilling and multi stage hydraulic fracturing treatments have demonstrated the potential for extracting significant additional quantities of oil and natural gas from the formation 
since the beginning of  there have been over horizontal wells drilled and completed in the mississippian formation in oklahoma 
since  we have drilled  as operator  horizontal wells throughout the mississippian formation  of which were producing and were awaiting completion at december  we had seven horizontal rigs drilling in the formation as of december  while horizontal wells are more expensive than vertical wells  a horizontal well bore increases the production of hydrocarbons and adds significant recoverable reserves per well 
in addition  an operator can drill one horizontal well  which is the equivalent of several vertical wells 
we had  gross  net acres leased in the mississippian formation in oklahoma and kansas as of december  west texas overthrust we have drilled and developed natural gas in the wto since this area is located in pecos and terrell counties in west texas and is associated with the marathon ouachita fold and thrust belt that extends east northeast across the united states into the appalachian mountain region 
the primary reservoir rocks in the wto range in depth from  to  feet and range in geologic age from the permian to the devonian 
the imbricate stacking of these conventional gas prone reservoirs provides for multi pay exploration and development opportunities 
despite this  the wto has historically been under explored 
the high co content of the natural gas  lack of infrastructure in the region  historical limitations of conventional subsurface geological and geophysical methods and commodity prices have combined to discourage exploration of the area 
our access to and control of the necessary infrastructure combined with the application of modern seismic techniques allow us to continue to identify exploration and development opportunities in the wto 
as of december   we had acquired  processed and interpreted  square miles of d seismic data in the wto 
we believe the use of this data will lower exploratory risk and improve completion efficiency by identifying structural detail of potential reservoirs 
pi on field 
the pi on field lies along the leading edge of the wto in pecos county 
the primary reservoirs are the tesnus sands depths ranging from  to  feet  the warwick caballos chert depths ranging from  to  feet and the dugout creek caballos chert depths ranging from  to  feet 
as of december   our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves in the pi on field were mmboe or bcfe  of which were proved undeveloped reserves based on estimates prepared by netherland sewell 
our interests in the pi on field as of december  included gross net producing wells and a average working interest in the producing area of the pi on field 
we were operating drilling rig in the pi on field as of december  and we drilled wells in this field during century plant 
in order to facilitate expansion of co treating capacity in the wto  we are constructing a co treatment plant in pecos county  texas the century plant  and associated compression and pipeline facilities pursuant to a construction agreement with a subsidiary of occidental petroleum corporation 
table of contents occidental 
under the terms of the agreement  we are obligated to construct the century plant and occidental is obligated to pay us a minimum of of the contract price  or million  plus any subsequently agreed upon revisions  through periodic cost reimbursements based upon the completion percentage of the project 
contract gains or losses will be recorded as development costs within our oil and natural gas properties as part of the full cost pool  when it is determined that a gain or loss will be incurred 
during  we recorded an addition of million to our oil and natural gas properties for the estimated loss identified based on current projections of the costs to be incurred in excess of contract amounts 
we expect to complete the century plant in two phases 
phase i entered the commissioning stage during the fourth quarter of and is expected to complete final tests and transfer to occidental in early century plant phase ii is under construction and expected to come on line by mid upon completion of each phase of the century plant  occidental will take ownership of the related assets and will operate the century plant for the purpose of separating and removing co from delivered natural gas 
pursuant to a year treating agreement executed simultaneously with the construction agreement  occidental will remove co from our delivered production volumes 
we will retain all methane gas from the natural gas we deliver to the century plant 
east texas cotton valley trend we own oil and natural gas interests in the natural gas bearing cotton valley trend  which covers parts of east texas and northern louisiana 
as of december   we held interests in  gross  net acres in east texas 
at that time  our estimated net proved reserves in east texas were mmboe or bcfe  with net production of approximately mboe or mmcfe per day for the month of december we focus our operations in the cotton valley trend on the tight sand reservoirs of the pettit and travis peak formations with depths ranging from  to  feet 
due to the tight nature of the reservoirs  significant hydraulic fracture stimulation is required to obtain commercial production rates and efficiently drain the reservoir 
production in this area is generally characterized as long lived  with wells having high initial production and decline rates that stabilize at lower levels after several years 
moreover  area operators continue to focus on infill development drilling as many areas have been down spaced to acres per well  with some areas down spaced to acres per well 
we drilled wells in the cotton valley trend in gulf coast as of december   we owned oil and natural gas interests in  gross  net acres in the gulf coast area  which encompasses the large coastal plain from the southernmost tip of texas through the southern portion of louisiana 
as of december   our estimated net proved reserves in the gulf coast area were mmboe or bcfe  with net production of approximately mboe or mmcfe per day for the month of december gulf of mexico as of december   we owned oil and natural gas interests in  gross  net acres in state and federal waters off the coasts of texas and louisiana 
as of december   our estimated net proved reserves in the gulf of mexico were mmboe or bcfe  with net production of approximately mboe or mmcfe per day for the month of december our operations in the gulf of mexico extend from the coast to more than miles offshore and occur in waters ranging from feet to  feet 
tertiary oil recovery we currently operate one active co flood and two waterfloods in which co pilot projects are currently under development 
all three floods are located in the permian basin area of west texas 
the wellman unit  located in terry county  is an active co flood in which co injection was re initiated in november of the two prospective co pilot waterfloods are the george allen unit and the south mallet unit  located in 
table of contents gaines and hockley counties 
injection is expected to begin into the george allen pilot in and into the south mallet pilot in the three enhanced recovery projects were producing net boe per day during and have produced a total of mmboe to date 
as of december   net proved reserves attributable to the three properties were mmboe 
expansion opportunities exist in all three projects and will be evaluated based on early performance results 
proved reserves the following historical estimates of net proved oil and natural gas reserves are based on reserve reports as of december   december  and december   substantially all of which were prepared by independent petroleum engineers

due to the full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax asset at december  that served to reduce to zero a tax benefit that otherwise would result from the tax effects of pv  there was no effect of income taxes on standardized measure at december  proved oil and natural gas reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas that  by analysis of geoscience and engineering data  can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward  from known reservoirs  and under existing economic conditions  operating methods and government regulations  prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire  unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain  regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for estimation 
to be classified as proved reserves  the project to extract the oil or natural gas must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time 

table of contents the area of a reservoir considered proved includes i the area identified by drilling and limited by fluid contacts  if any  and ii adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can  with reasonable certainty  be judged to be continuous with it and to contain economically producible oil or natural gas on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data 
in the absence of data on fluid contacts  proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons as seen in a well penetration unless geoscience  engineering or performance data and reliable technology establish a lower contact with reasonable certainty 
where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap  proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geoscience  engineering or performance data and reliable technology establish the higher contact with reasonable certainty 
reserves that can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques such as fluid injection are included in the proved classification when i successful testing by a pilot project in an area of the reservoir with properties no more favorable than in the reservoir as a whole  the operation of an installed program in the reservoir  or an analogous reservoir  or other evidence using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty of the engineering analysis on which the project or program was based and ii the project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities  including governmental entities 
existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined 
in determining the amount of proved reserves  the price used must be the average price during the month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the reserve report  determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first day of the month price for each month within such period  unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements  excluding escalations based upon future conditions

the month average natural gas index price of per mcf  compared to the month average natural gas price of for  used in the estimation of natural gas reserves as of december  resulted in upward revisions of quantities associated with the company s proved undeveloped properties 
we recognized additional oil and natural gas reserves attributable to extensions and discoveries as a result of successful drilling in the permian basin and mid continent areas 
additionally  the arena acquisition resulted in an increase to our proved undeveloped oil and natural gas reserves 
the month average natural gas index price of per mcf used in the estimation of reserves as of december  resulted in downward revisions of quantities associated with the company s proved undeveloped properties as a significant number of properties generated no pv value resulting in the elimination of associated reserve quantities and a shortening of the productive lives of certain proved properties that became uneconomic earlier in their lives with the use of lower natural gas prices compared to prices used in the estimation of reserves in previous periods

we had two customers that individually accounted for more than of our total revenue during see note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report for additional information on our major customers 
the number of readily available purchasers for our products makes it unlikely that the loss of a single customer in the areas in which we sell our products would materially affect our sales 
we are not committed under any existing contracts or agreements to provide fixed and determinable quantities of oil or natural gas in the future 
title to properties as is customary in the oil and natural gas industry  we initially conduct a cursory review of the title to our properties for which we do not have proved reserves 
prior to the commencement of drilling operations on those properties  we conduct a thorough title examination and perform curative work with respect to significant defects 
to the extent drilling title opinions or other investigations reflect title defects on those properties  we are 
table of contents typically responsible for curing any title defects at our expense 
we generally will not commence drilling operations on a property until we have cured any material title defects on such property 
in addition  prior to completing an acquisition of producing oil and natural gas leases  we perform title reviews on the most significant leases  and depending on the materiality of properties  we may obtain a drilling title opinion or review previously obtained title opinions 
to date  we have obtained drilling title opinions on substantially all of our producing properties and believe that we have good and defensible title to our producing properties 
our oil and natural gas properties are subject to customary royalty and other interests  liens for current taxes and other burdens  which we believe do not materially interfere with the use of or affect our carrying value of the properties 
drilling and oil field services the drilling and related oil field services that we provide to our exploration and production business and to third parties are described below 
drilling operations we drill for our own account primarily in west texas and northwest oklahoma through our drilling and oil field services subsidiary  lariat 
in addition  we also drill wells for other oil and natural gas companies  primarily in the west texas region 
we believe that drilling with our own rigs allows us to control costs and maintain operating flexibility 
our rig fleet is designed to drill in our specific areas of operation and has an average of over horsepower and an average depth capacity of greater than  feet 
as of december   our drilling rig fleet consisted of rigs with of these rigs working on properties that we operated 
the table below presents certain information concerning our contract drilling operations and our rigs year ended december  number of operational rigs owned at end of period average number of operational rigs owned during the period average drilling revenue per day per rig working for third parties represents revenues from our rigs working for third parties divided by the total number of days our drilling rigs were used by third parties during the period

the average drilling revenue per day per rig working for third parties increased for the year ended december  compared to primarily due to some rigs receiving reduced idle or stand by rates during there were no rigs receiving idle or stand by rates during as of december   we owned drilling rigs through lariat 
the table below presents a summary of our rigs december  rigs working for sandridge working for third parties idle total operational non operational total includes rigs being serviced at december  and 
table of contents our drilling program and drilling activity for third parties increased significantly in  resulting in more rigs working for us and third parties and fewer rigs idle at december  compared to december  or december  types of drilling contracts we obtain our contracts for drilling oil and natural gas wells either through competitive bidding or through direct negotiations with customers 
our drilling contracts generally provide for compensation on a daywork or footage basis 
the contract terms we offer generally depend on the complexity and risk of operations  the on site drilling conditions  the type of equipment used  the anticipated duration of the work to be performed and prevailing market rates 
for a discussion of these contracts  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations segment overview drilling and oil field services segment in item of this report 
oil field services our oil field services business conducts operations that together with our drilling services complement our exploration and production business 
oil field services include providing pulling units  trucking  rental tools  location and road construction and roustabout services to us as well as to third parties 
our customers during  we performed approximately of our drilling and oil field services in support of our exploration and production segment and approximately for other operators 
for the years ended december   and  we generated revenues of million  million and million  respectively  for drilling and oil field services performed for third parties 
capital expenditures our capital expenditures for related to our drilling and oil field services were million 
we have budgeted approximately million in capital expenditures in for our drilling and oil field services segment 
midstream gas services we provide gathering  compression and treating services of natural gas in west texas 
our midstream operations and assets not only serve our exploration and production segment  but also service other oil and natural gas companies

we also own the grey ranch co 

treatment plant located in pecos county and have a interest in the partnership that leases the plant from us under a lease expiring in in october  we took over operations at the grey ranch plant pursuant to an agreement with such partnership 
the treating capacities for both the pike s peak and grey ranch plants are dependent upon the quality of natural gas being treated 
the data included in the table above for the pike s peak and grey ranch plants is based on a natural gas stream that averaged co our two west texas gas treating plants remove co from natural gas production and deliver residue gas into the atmos lone star and enterprise energy services pipelines 
these assets are operated on fixed fees based upon throughput of natural gas 
in addition  we have access for up to mmcf per day of treating capacity at hoover energy partners mitchell plant under a long term fixed fee arrangement 
we also own or operate over  miles of natural gas gathering pipelines and numerous dehydration units 
within the pi on field  we operate separate gathering systems for sweet natural gas and produced natural gas containing high percentages of co in addition to servicing our exploration and production business  these assets also service other oil and natural gas companies 
the majority of the produced natural gas gathered by our midstream assets in west texas requires compression from the wellhead to the final sales meter 
as of december   we owned or operated approximately  horsepower of gas compression in west texas 
in conjunction with the june sale of our gathering and compression assets located in the pi on field  we entered into a gas gathering agreement and an operations and maintenance agreement 
under the gas gathering agreement  we have dedicated the pi on field acreage for priority gathering services for a period of years and we will pay a fee that was negotiated at arms length for such services 
other areas as of december   we owned approximately miles of pipeline gathering systems and operated more than  horsepower of natural gas compression in east texas 
we also owned approximately miles of pipeline gathering systems and operated over  horsepower of gas compression in the gulf coast area  and owned approximately miles of pipeline in the mid continent area 
capital expenditures the growth of our midstream assets is driven by our oil and natural gas exploration and development operations 
historically  pipeline and facility expansions are made when warranted by the increase in production or the development of additional acreage 
during  we spent million in capital expenditures primarily to install pipeline and compression infrastructure 
with phase i of the century plant expected to be fully commissioned in early  we will add mmcf per day in available treating capacity in we have budgeted approximately million in capital expenditures for our midstream gas services segment and other general corporate purposes 

table of contents marketing through integra energy  llc  our wholly owned subsidiary  we buy and sell natural gas from wells we operate and wells operated by third parties within our west texas operations 
we generally buy and sell natural gas on back to back contracts using a portfolio of baseload and spot sales agreements 
identical volumes are bought and sold on monthly and daily contracts using a combination of published pricing indices to eliminate price exposure 
we periodically buy and sell third party natural gas 
we conduct thorough credit checks with all potential purchasers and minimize our exposure by contracting with multiple parties each month 
we do not engage in any hedging activities with respect to these contracts 
we manage several interruptible natural gas transportation agreements in order to take advantage of price differentials or to secure available markets when necessary 
we currently have  mmbtu per day of firm transportation service subscribed on the oasis pipeline and  mmbtu per day on the mid continent express pipeline for a portion of our pi on field production for other operations our co capturing operations are conducted through sandridge co as of december   sandridge co 

owned miles of co pipelines in west texas with approximately  horsepower of owned and leased co compression available and currently operational 
the captured co is primarily used for tertiary oil recovery operations 
as of december   sandridge co was capturing approximately mmcf per day of co we delivered the majority of this to occidental permian ltd 
in december  we captured and sold an average of mmcf of co per day and utilized mmcf per day in our enhanced oil recovery projects 
future regulation of greenhouse gas emissions may provide us an opportunity to create economic benefits in the form of emissions reduction credits ercs  but such regulation may also impose burdens on the conduct and cost of our operations 
legislative and regulatory efforts may result in legal requirements that create a more active and more valuable market in which to trade ercs  although the timing and scope of future legal requirements governing greenhouse gases remain uncertain 
we currently capture approximately million metric tonnes of co per year  all of which is utilized in enhanced oil recovery projects 
the captured co may prove beneficial to us if the co capture results in ercs that can be traded or used by us to meet future regulatory compliance obligations that may otherwise be costly to satisfy 
ercs of just over million metric tonnes were sold on the voluntary market during see environmental regulations 
competition we believe that our leasehold acreage position  drilling and oil field services businesses  midstream assets  co supply and technical and operational capabilities generally enable us to compete effectively 
however  the oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive  and we face competition in each of our business segments 
we believe our geographic concentration of operations and vertical integration enables us to compete effectively with other exploration and production operations 
we compete with major oil and natural gas companies and independent oil and natural gas companies for leases  equipment  personnel and markets for the sale of oil and natural gas 
many of these competitors are financially stronger than us  but even financially troubled competitors can affect the market because of their need to sell oil and natural gas at any price to attempt to maintain cash flow 
certain companies may be able to pay more for producing properties and undeveloped acreage 
in addition  these companies may have a greater ability to continue exploration activities during periods of low oil and natural gas market prices 
our larger or fully integrated competitors may be able to absorb the burden of any existing and future federal  state and local laws and regulations more easily than we can  which would adversely affect our competitive position 
our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future depends on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate 
table of contents transactions in a highly competitive environment 
in addition  because we have fewer financial and human resources than many companies in our industry  we may be at a disadvantage in bidding for exploratory prospects and producing oil and natural gas properties 
oil and natural gas compete with other forms of energy available to customers  primarily based on price 
these alternate forms of energy include electricity  coal and fuel oils 
changes in the availability or price of oil and natural gas or other forms of energy  as well as business conditions  conservation  legislation  regulations and the ability to convert to alternate fuels and other forms of energy may affect the demand for oil and natural gas 
with respect to our drilling business  we believe the type  age and condition of our drilling rigs  the quality of our crews and the responsiveness of our management generally enable us to compete effectively 
however  to the extent we drill for third parties  we encounter substantial competition from other drilling contractors 
our primary market area is highly competitive 
the drilling contracts we compete for are usually awarded on the basis of competitive bids 
we may  based on the economic environment at the time  determine that market conditions and profit margins are such that contract drilling for third parties is not a beneficial use of our resources 
we believe pricing and rig availability are the primary factors our potential customers consider in determining which drilling contractor to select 
while we must be competitive in our pricing  our competitive strategy generally emphasizes the quality of our equipment and the experience of our rig crews to differentiate us from our competitors 
this strategy is less effective when demand for drilling services is weak or there is an oversupply of rigs 
these conditions usually result in increased price competition  which makes it more difficult for us to compete on the basis of factors other than price 
many of our competitors have greater financial  technical and other resources than we do 
their greater capabilities in these areas may enable them to better withstand industry downturns and better retain skilled rig personnel 
we believe our geographic concentration of operations enables us to compete effectively in our midstream business segment 
most of our midstream assets are integrated with our production 
however  with respect to third party natural gas and acquisitions  we compete with companies that have greater financial and personnel resources than we do 
these companies may be able to pay more for acquisitions 
in addition  these companies may have a greater ability to price their services below our prices for similar services 
seasonal nature of business generally  demand for oil and natural gas decreases during the summer months and increases during the winter months 
in addition  certain natural gas users utilize natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements during the summer 
this can also lessen seasonal demand fluctuations 
seasonal weather conditions and lease stipulations can limit our drilling and producing activities and other oil and natural gas operations in a portion of our operating areas 
these seasonal anomalies can pose challenges for meeting our well drilling objectives and can increase competition for equipment  supplies and personnel during the spring and summer months  which could lead to shortages and increase costs or delay our operations 
environmental regulations general the exploration  development and production operations of oil and natural gas are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection 
these laws and regulations may  among other things  require permits to conduct drilling  water withdrawal and waste disposal operations  govern the amounts and types of substances that may be disposed or released into the environment  limit or prohibit construction or drilling activities in sensitive areas such as wetlands  wilderness areas or areas inhabited by endangered or threatened species  require investigatory and remedial actions to mitigate pollution conditions arising from our operations or attributable to former 
table of contents operations  and impose obligations to reclaim and abandon well sites and pits 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions  including monetary penalties  the imposition of remedial obligations and the issuance of orders enjoining some or all of our operations in affected areas 
the clear trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment  and thus  any changes in environmental laws and regulations or re interpretation of enforcement policies that result in more stringent and costly waste handling  storage  transport  disposal  or remediation requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position 
we may be unable to pass on such increased compliance costs to its customers 
moreover  accidental releases or spills may occur in the course of our operations  and there can be no assurance that we will not incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of such releases or spills  including any third party claims for damage to property and natural resources or personal injury 
the following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental  health and safety laws and regulations applicable to the oil and natural gas industry and for which compliance may have a material adverse impact on our operations 
hazardous substances and wastes the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act  as amended cercla  also known as the superfund law and comparable state laws impose joint and several liability without regard to fault or legality of conduct  on certain classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment 
these persons include current and prior owners or operators of the site where the release occurred and entities that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site 
under cercla  these responsible persons may be subject to strict joint and several  liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment  for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain environmental and health studies 
in addition  it is not uncommon for neighboring land owners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances into the environment 
cercla also authorizes the environmental protection agency epa and  in some instances  third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur 
we generate materials in the course of our operations that may be regulated as hazardous substances 
we also generate wastes that are subject to the requirements of the resource conservation and recovery act  as amended rcra  and comparable state statutes 
rcra imposes strict requirements on the generation  transportation  treatment  storage  disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non hazardous wastes 
in the course of our operations  we generate petroleum hydrocarbon wastes and ordinary industrial wastes that are subject to regulation under the rcra 
we are in substantial compliance with all regulations regarding the handling and disposal of oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes from its operations 
we currently own or lease  and in the past may have owned or leased  properties that have been used to explore for and produce oil and natural gas 
although we may have utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time  hydrocarbons and wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by us or on or under the other locations where these hydrocarbons and wastes have been taken for treatment or disposal 
in addition  certain of these properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons and wastes was not under our control 
these properties and wastes disposed thereon may be subject to cercla  rcra and analogous state laws 
under these laws  we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes  to clean up contaminated property and to perform remedial operations to prevent future contamination 

table of contents air emissions the federal clean air act and comparable state laws control emissions of potentially harmful air emissions through permitting and monitoring regulations 
we are required to obtain various permits to ensure that emissions from our operations remain within permitted levels 
to comply with the terms of these permits  and  as part of our ongoing efforts to operate in an environmentally responsible manner  we have installed and maintained emission control technologies throughout our systems 
climate change in december  the epa published its findings that emissions of carbon dioxide  methane and certain other greenhouse gases ghgs present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are  according to the epa  contributing to warming of the earth s atmosphere and other climatic changes 
these findings allow the epa to adopt and implement regulations that would restrict emissions of ghgs under existing provisions of the federal clean air act 
these findings allow the epa to adopt and implement regulations that would restrict emissions of ghgs under existing provisions of the federal clean air act 
accordingly  the epa has proposed regulations that would require a reduction in emissions of ghgs from motor vehicles and adopted regulations that could trigger permit review for ghg emissions from certain stationary sources 
in addition  in october  the epa published a final rule requiring the reporting of ghg emissions from specified large ghg emission sources in the united states  including sources emitting more than  tons of ghgs on an annual basis  beginning in for emissions occurring in on november   the epa published a final rule that expands its october final rule on reporting of ghg emissions to include owners and operators of onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production  effective december  the adoption and implementation of any regulations imposing reporting obligations on  or limiting emissions of ghg gases from  our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of ghgs associated with its operations or could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas it produces 
finally  it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of ghgs in the earth s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects  such as increased frequency and severity of storms  droughts  and floods and other climatic events  if any such effects were to occur  they could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations 
in addition  congress has actively considered legislation to reduce emissions of ghgs and president obama has indicated his support of legislation to reduce ghg emission through an emission allowance system 
even if such legislation is not adopted at the national level  almost one half of the states have begun taking actions to control and or reduce emissions of ghgs  primarily through the planned development of ghg emission inventories and or regional ghg cap and trade programs 
although most of the state level initiatives have to date focused on large sources of ghg emissions  such as coal fired electric plants  it is possible that smaller sources of emissions could become subject to ghg emission limitations or allowance purchase requirements in the future 
any future federal laws or implementing regulations that may be adopted to address ghg emissions could require us to incur increased operating costs  could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce  and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we will formally assess ghg emissions related to all company operations in we do not believe the total cost of this project will be material 
water discharge the federal water pollution control act  or the clean water act  and analogous state laws  impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants  including spills and leaks of oil and other substances into waters of the united states  including wetlands  as well as state waters 
these laws prohibit the discharge of produced waters and sand  drilling fluids  drill cuttings and other substances related to the oil and natural gas industry into onshore  coastal and offshore waters without appropriate permits 
some of the pollutant limitations have become more restrictive over the years  and additional restrictions and limitations  
table of contents including technology requirements and receiving water limits  may be imposed in the future 
the clean water act also regulates storm water discharges from industrial and construction activities 
regulations promulgated by the epa and state regulatory agencies require industries engaged in certain industrial or construction activities to acquire permits and implement storm water management plans and best management practices  to conduct periodic monitoring and reporting of discharges  and to train employees 
further  federal and state regulations require certain natural gas and oil exploration and production facilities to obtain permits for storm water discharges 
there are costs associated with each of these regulatory requirements 
in addition  federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative  civil and potentially criminal penalties for non compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the clean water act and analogous state laws and regulations 
the oil pollution act of opa  which amends and augments the clean water act  establishes strict liability for owners and operators of facilities that are the site of a release of oil into waters of the united states 
in addition  opa and regulations that implement opa impose requirements on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for clean up and natural resource damages resulting from such spills 
for example  some of our facilities in the gulf coast region must develop  implement and maintain facility response plans  conduct annual spill training for certain employees  conduct annual spill drills and provide varying degrees of financial assurance 
groundwater and safe drinking water act oil and natural gas may be recovered from certain of our oil and natural gas properties through the use of hydraulic fracturing  combined with sophisticated horizontal drilling 
hydraulic fracturing  which involves the injection of water  sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production  is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions but is not subject to regulation at the federal level 
the epa has commenced a study of the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing activities  with results of the study anticipated to be available by late  and a committee of the us house of representatives is also conducting an investigation of hydraulic fracturing practices 
legislation has been introduced before congress to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process 
in addition  some states have adopted regulations that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances 
if new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted in the states in which we operate  such legal requirements could make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing to stimulate production in the mississippian play and thereby affect the determination of whether a well is commercially viable 
in addition  if hydraulic fracturing is regulated at the federal level  our fracturing activities could become subject to additional permit requirements or operational restrictions and also to associated permitting delays and potential increases in costs 
restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we are ultimately able to produce in commercial quantities 
national environmental policy act oil and natural gas exploration and production activities on federal lands or otherwise requiring federal approval are subject to the national environmental policy act nepa 
nepa requires federal agencies  including the department of interior  to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to significantly impact the environment 
in the course of such evaluations  an agency may prepare an environmental assessment that assesses the potential direct  indirect and cumulative impacts of a proposed project and  if necessary  will prepare a more detailed environmental impact statement that is made available for public review and comment 
all of our current exploration and production activities  as well as proposed exploration and development plans on federal lands  require governmental permits that are subject to the requirements of nepa 
the nepa process has the potential to delay or even prohibit our development of oil and natural gas projects in covered areas 

table of contents endangered species act the federal endangered species act  as amended esa  restricts activities that may affect endangered and threatened species or their habitats 
while some of our facilities or leased acreage may be located in areas that are designated as habitat for endangered or threatened species  we believes that we are in substantial compliance with the esa 
however  the designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or bans in the affected areas 
employee health and safety our operations are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations  including the federal occupational safety and health act  as amended osha  and comparable state statutes  whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers 
in addition  the osha hazard communication standard  the epa community right to know regulations under title iii of the federal superfund amendment and reauthorization act and comparable state statutes require that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees  state and local government authorities and citizens 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations relating to worker health and safety 
state regulation the states in which we operate regulate the drilling for  and the production and gathering of  oil and natural gas  including requirements relating to drilling permits  the location  spacing and density of wells  unitization and pooling of interests  the method of drilling  casing and equipping of wells  the protection of fresh water sources  the orderly development of common sources of supply of oil and natural gas  the operation of wells  allowable rates of production  the use of fresh water in oil and natural gas operations  saltwater injection and disposal operations  the plugging and abandonment of wells and the restoration of surface properties  the prevention of waste of oil and natural gas resources  the protection of the correlative rights of oil and natural gas owners and  where necessary to avoid unfair  unjust or discriminatory service  the fees  terms and conditions for the gathering of natural gas 
the effect of these regulations may be to limit the number of wells that we may drill  impact the locations at which we may drill wells  restrict the amounts of oil and natural gas that may be produced from our wells and increase the costs of our operations 
anti terrorism measures the federal department of homeland security appropriations act of requires the department of homeland security dhs to issue regulations establishing risk based performance standards for the security of chemical and industrial facilities  including oil and natural gas facilities that are deemed to present high levels of security risk 
the dhs issued an interim final rule in regarding risk based performance standards to be attained pursuant to the act and  on november   further issued an appendix a to the interim rules establishing chemicals of interest and their respective threshold quantities that will trigger compliance with the interim rules 
we have performed a preliminary assessment of our major facilities and determined that one of our facilities may require a formal vulnerability assessment and security plan 
the costs to implement additional security measures as a result could be substantial 
other regulation of the oil and natural gas industry the oil and natural gas industry is extensively regulated by numerous federal  state and local authorities  including native american tribes 
legislation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion  frequently increasing the regulatory burden 
also  numerous departments and agencies  both federal and state  and native american tribes are authorized by statute to issue rules and 
table of contents regulations binding on the oil and natural gas industry and its individual members  some of which carry substantial penalties for noncompliance 
although the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases our cost of doing business and  consequently  affects our profitability  these burdens generally do not affect us any differently or to any greater or lesser extent than they affect other companies in the industry with similar types  quantities and locations of production 
the availability  terms and cost of transportation significantly affect sales of oil and natural gas 
the interstate transportation and sale for resale of oil and natural gas is subject to federal regulation  including regulation of the terms  conditions and rates for interstate transportation  storage and various other matters  primarily by the federal energy regulatory commission 
federal and state regulations govern the price and terms for access to oil and natural gas pipeline transportation 
the federal energy regulatory commission s regulations for interstate oil and natural gas transmission in some circumstances may also affect the intrastate transportation of oil and natural gas 
although oil and natural gas prices are currently unregulated  congress historically has been active in the area of oil and natural gas regulation 
we cannot predict whether new legislation to regulate oil and natural gas might be proposed  what proposals  if any  might actually be enacted by congress or the various state legislatures  and what effect  if any  the proposals might have on our operations 
sales of condensate and oil and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at market prices 
drilling and production our operations are subject to various types of regulation at federal  state  local and native american tribal levels 
these types of regulation include requiring permits for the drilling of wells  drilling bonds and reports concerning operations 
most states  and some counties  municipalities and native american tribal areas where we operate also regulate one or more of the following activities the location of wells  the method of drilling and casing wells  the timing of construction or drilling activities  the rates of production or allowables  the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled  the plugging and abandoning of wells  and the notice to surface owners and other third parties 
state laws regulate the size and shape of drilling and spacing units or proration units governing the pooling of oil and natural gas properties 
some states allow forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases 
in some instances  forced pooling or unitization may be implemented by third parties and may reduce our interest in the unitized properties 
in addition  state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells  generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose requirements regarding the ratability of production 
these laws and regulations may limit the amount of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells or limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill 
moreover  each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of natural gas  oil and natural gas liquids within its jurisdiction 
federal  state and local regulations provide detailed requirements for the abandonment of wells  closure or decommissioning of production facilities and pipelines  and for site restoration  in areas where we operate 
regulations of the bureau of ocean energy management  regulation and enforcement boemr require that owners and operators plug and abandon wells and decommission and remove offshore facilities located in federal 
table of contents offshore lease areas in a prescribed manner 
boemr requires federal leaseholders to post performance bonds or otherwise provide necessary financial assurances to provide for such abandonment  decommissioning and removal 
the new mexico oil conservation requires the posting of performance bonds to fulfill financial requirements for owners and operators on state land 
the railroad commission of texas has financial responsibility requirements for owners and operators of facilities in state waters to provide for similar assurances 
the united states army corps of engineers acoe and many other state and local authorities also have regulations for plugging and abandonment  decommissioning and site restoration 
although the acoe does not require bonds or other financial assurances  some state agencies and municipalities do have such requirements 
natural gas sales and transportation historically  federal legislation and regulatory controls have affected the price of the natural gas we produce and the manner in which we market our production 
the federal energy regulatory commission ferc has jurisdiction over the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce by natural gas companies under the natural gas act of and the natural gas policy act of various federal laws enacted since have resulted in the complete removal of all price and non price controls for sales of domestic natural gas sold in first sales  which include all of our sales of our own production 
under the energy policy act of  ferc has substantial enforcement authority to prohibit the manipulation of natural gas markets and enforce its rules and orders  including the ability to assess substantial civil penalties 
ferc also regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates and service conditions and establishes the terms under which we may use interstate natural gas pipeline capacity  which affects the marketing of natural gas that we produce  as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas and release of our natural gas pipeline capacity 
commencing in  ferc promulgated a series of orders  regulations and rule makings that significantly fostered competition in the business of transporting and marketing gas 
today  interstate pipeline companies are required to provide nondiscriminatory transportation services to producers  marketers and other shippers  regardless of whether such shippers are affiliated with an interstate pipeline company 
ferc s initiatives have led to the development of a competitive  open access market for natural gas purchases and sales that permits all purchasers of natural gas to buy gas directly from third party sellers other than pipelines 
however  the natural gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated  therefore  we cannot guarantee that the less stringent regulatory approach currently pursued by ferc and congress will continue indefinitely into the future nor can we determine what effect  if any  future regulatory changes might have on our natural gas related activities 
under ferc s current regulatory regime  transmission services must be provided on an open access  nondiscriminatory basis at cost based rates or at market based rates if the transportation market at issue is sufficiently competitive 
gathering service  which occurs upstream of jurisdictional transmission services  is regulated by the states onshore and in state waters 
although its policy is still in flux  ferc has in the past reclassified certain jurisdictional transmission facilities as non jurisdictional gathering facilities  which has the tendency to increase our costs of transporting gas to point of sale locations 
employees as of december   we had  full time employees  including more than geologists  geophysicists  petroleum engineers  technicians  land and regulatory professionals 
of our  employees  are located at our headquarters in oklahoma city  oklahoma  and the remaining employees work in our various field offices and at our drilling sites

has the meaning given to such term in rule a of regulation s x  which defines proved reserves as those quantities of oil and natural gas which  by analysis of geoscience and engineering data  can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward  from known reservoirs  and under existing economic conditions  operating methods  and government regulations  prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire  unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain  regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for estimation 
the project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time 
the area of a reservoir considered proved includes i the area identified by drilling and limited by fluid contacts  if any  and ii adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can  with reasonable certainty  be judged to be continuous with it and to contain economically producible oil or gas on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data 
in the absence of data on fluid contacts  proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons as seen in a well penetration unless geoscience  engineering or performance data and reliable technology establish a lower contact with reasonable certainty 
where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap  proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geoscience  engineering or performance data and reliable technology establish the higher contact with reasonable certainty 
reserves that can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques including  but not limited to  fluid injection are included in the proved classification when i successful testing by a pilot project in an area of the reservoir with properties no more favorable than in the reservoir as a whole  the operation of an installed program in the reservoir  or an analogous reservoir  or other evidence using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty of the engineering analysis on which the project or program was based and ii the project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities  including governmental entities 
existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined 
the price shall be the average price during the month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report  determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first day of the month price for each month within such period  unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements  excluding escalations based upon future conditions 
proved undeveloped reserves 
reserves that are both proved and undeveloped 

table of contents pulling units 
pulling units are used in connection with completions and workover operations 
pv see present value of future net revenues above 
rental tools 
a variety of rental tools and equipment  ranging from trash trailers to blow out preventors to sand separators  for use in the oil field 
reserves 
estimated remaining quantities of oil and natural gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible by application of development projects to known accumulations 
in addition  there must exist  or there must be a reasonable expectation that there will exist  the legal right to produce or a revenue interest in the production  installed means of delivering oil and natural gas or related substances to market  and all permits and financing required to implement the project 
included note reserves should not be assigned to adjacent reservoirs isolated by major  potentially sealing  faults until those reservoirs are penetrated and evaluated as economically producible 
reserves should not be assigned to areas that are clearly separated from a known accumulation by a non productive reservoir ie absence of reservoir  structurally low reservoir  or negative test results 
such areas may contain prospective resources ie potentially recoverable resources from undiscovered accumulations 
reservoir 
a porous and permeable underground formation containing a natural accumulation of producible oil and or natural gas that is confined by impermeable rock or water barriers and is individual and separate from other reservoirs 
roustabout services 
the provision of manpower to assist in conducting oil field operations 
standardized measure or standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows 
the present value of estimated future cash inflows from proved oil and natural gas reserves  less future development and production costs and future income tax expenses  discounted at per annum to reflect timing of future cash flows and using the same pricing assumptions as were used to calculate pv standardized measure differs from pv because standardized measure includes the effect of future income taxes on future net revenues 
trucking 
the provision of trucks to move our drilling rigs from one well location to another and to deliver water and equipment to the field 
undeveloped acreage 
lease acreage on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of economic quantities of oil or natural gas regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves 
undeveloped oil and natural gas reserves 
reserves of any category that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage  or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion 
i reserves on undrilled acreage are limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled  unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances 
ii undrilled locations are classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years  unless the specific circumstances justify a longer time 
iii under no circumstances shall estimates for undeveloped reserves attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated  unless such techniques 
table of contents have been proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir or by other evidence using reliable technology establishing reasonable certainty 
working interest 
the operating interest that gives the owner the right to drill  produce and conduct operating activities on the property and receive a share of production and requires the owner to pay a share of the costs of drilling and production operations 
item a 
risk factors oil and natural gas prices are volatile  and a decline in oil and natural gas prices could significantly affect our financial results and impede our growth 
our revenues  profitability and cash flow depend upon the prices and demand for oil and natural gas 
the markets for these commodities are very volatile 
oil and natural gas prices can fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors that are beyond our control 
these factors include  among others regional  domestic and foreign supply  and perceptions of supply  of oil and natural gas  the price of foreign imports  us and worldwide political and economic conditions  the level of demand  and perceptions of demand  for oil and natural gas  weather conditions and seasonal trends  anticipated future prices of oil and natural gas  alternative fuels and other commodities  technological advances affecting energy consumption and energy supply  the proximity  capacity  cost and availability of pipeline infrastructure  treating  transportation and refining capacity  acts of force majeure  domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxation  energy conservation and environmental measures  and the price and availability of alternative fuels 
for oil  from through  the highest monthly nymex settled price was per bbl and the lowest was per bbl 
for natural gas  from through  the highest monthly nymex settled price was per mmbtu and the lowest was per mmbtu 
in addition  the market price of oil and natural gas is generally higher in the winter months than during other months of the year due to increased demand for oil and natural gas for heating purposes during the winter season 
lower oil and natural gas prices may not only decrease our revenues on a per share basis  but also may reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically and  therefore  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
this also may result in our having to make substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves 
future price declines may result in further reductions of the asset carrying values of our oil and natural gas properties 
we utilize the full cost method of accounting for costs related to our oil and natural gas properties 
under this accounting method  all costs for both productive and nonproductive properties are capitalized and amortized on an aggregate basis over the estimated lives of the properties using the unit of production method 
however  
table of contents the amount of these costs that can be carried as capitalized assets is subject to a ceiling  which limits such pooled costs to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues of proved oil and natural gas reserves attributable to proved properties  discounted at  plus the lower of cost or market value of unevaluated properties 
the full cost ceiling is evaluated at the end of each quarter using the most recent month average prices for oil and natural gas  adjusted for the impact of derivatives accounted for as cash flow hedges 
in the event any of our derivatives are accounted for as cash flow hedges  the impact of these derivative contracts will be included in the determination of our full cost ceiling 
we had no full cost ceiling impairments during the year ended december   while our ceiling limitations during resulted in non cash impairment charges totaling  million 
future declines in oil and natural gas prices  without other mitigating circumstances  could result in additional losses of future net revenues  including losses attributable to quantities that cannot be economically produced at lower prices  which could cause us to make additional write downs of capitalized costs of our oil and natural gas properties and non cash charges against future earnings 
the amount of such future write downs and non cash charges could be substantial 
we have a substantial amount of indebtedness and other obligations and commitments  which may adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to operate our business 
as of december   our total indebtedness was billion  and we had preferred stock outstanding with an aggregate liquidation preference of million 
our substantial level of indebtedness and the dividends payable on our preferred stock outstanding increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay  when due  the principal of  interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness and or the preferred stock dividends 
our indebtedness and outstanding preferred stock  combined with our lease and other financial obligations and contractual commitments  could have other important consequences to us 
for example  it could make us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic  industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other general corporate purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged and  therefore  may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our indebtedness prevents us from pursuing  and limit our ability to borrow additional amounts for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  debt service requirements  execution of our business strategy or other purposes 
any of the above listed factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our estimated reserves are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate 
any significant inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions could materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves 
our current estimates of reserves could change  potentially in material amounts  in the future 
the process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex and inherently imprecise 
it requires interpretations of available technical data and many assumptions  including assumptions relating to production rates and economic factors such as oil and natural gas prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures and availability of funds 
any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves shown in this report 
see business our businesses and primary operations in item of this report for information about our oil and natural gas reserves 

table of contents actual future production  oil and natural gas prices  revenues  taxes  development expenditures  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves most likely will vary from our estimates 
any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves shown in this report  which in turn could have a negative effect on the value of our assets 
in addition  from time to time in the future  we may adjust estimates of proved reserves  potentially in material amounts  to reflect production history  results of exploration and development  oil and natural gas prices and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
the present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves will not necessarily be the same as the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves 
we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on month average prices and costs 
actual future net cash flows from our oil and natural gas properties also will be affected by factors such as actual prices we receive for oil and natural gas  the accuracy of our reserve estimates  the actual cost of development and production expenditures  the amount and timing of actual production  supply of and demand for oil and natural gas  and changes in governmental regulations or taxation 
the timing of both our production and our incurrence of expenses in connection with the development and production of oil and natural gas properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves  and thus their actual present value 
in addition  we use a discount factor when calculating discounted future net cash flows which may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and natural gas industry in general 
unless we replace our oil and natural gas reserves  our reserves and production will decline  which would adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our future oil and natural gas reserves and production  and therefore our cash flow and income  are highly dependent on our success in efficiently developing and exploiting our current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves 
we may not be able to develop  find or acquire additional reserves to replace our current and future production at acceptable costs 
we will not know conclusively prior to drilling whether oil or natural gas will be present in sufficient quantities to be economically viable 
the use of seismic data and other technologies and the study of producing fields in the same area does not enable us to know conclusively prior to drilling whether oil or natural gas will be present or  if present  whether oil or natural gas will be present in sufficient quantities to be economically viable 
even if sufficient amounts of oil or natural gas exist  we may damage the potentially productive hydrocarbon bearing formation or experience mechanical difficulties while drilling or completing the well  resulting in a reduction in production from the well or abandonment of the well 
during  we participated in drilling a total of gross wells  of which were identified as dry wells 
if we drill additional wells that we identify as dry wells in our current and future prospects  our drilling success rate may decline and materially harm our business 
in summary  the cost of drilling  completing and operating any well is often uncertain  and new wells may not be productive 

table of contents volatility in the capital markets could affect our ability to obtain capital  cause us to incur additional financing expense or affect the value of certain assets 
in recent periods  global financial markets and economic conditions have been disrupted and volatile due to multiple factors  including significant write offs in the financial services sector and weak economic conditions 
in some cases  the markets have produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit capacity for certain issuers without regard to those issuers underlying financial and or operating strength 
due to this volatility  for many companies the cost of raising money in the debt and equity capital markets has been greater in recent periods than has historically been the case 
continued market volatility may from time to time adversely affect our ability to access capital and credit markets or to obtain funds at low interest rates or on other advantageous terms 
these factors may adversely affect our business  results of operations or liquidity 
these factors may adversely affect the value of certain of our assets and our ability to draw on our senior credit facility 
adverse credit and capital market conditions may require us to impair the carrying value of assets associated with derivative contracts to account for non performance by counterparties to those contracts 
if financial institutions that have extended credit commitments to us are adversely affected by volatile conditions of the united states and international capital markets  they may become unable to fund borrowings under their credit commitments to us  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to borrow additional funds  if needed  for working capital  capital expenditures and other corporate purposes 
properties that we buy may not produce as projected  and we may be unable to determine reserve potential  identify liabilities associated with the properties or obtain protection from sellers against them 
our reviews of properties we acquire are inherently incomplete because an in depth review of every individual property involved in each acquisition generally is not feasible 
even a detailed review of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems  nor will it permit a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully their deficiencies and potential 
inspections may not always be performed on every well  and environmental problems  such as soil or ground water contamination  are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken 
even when problems are identified  we may assume certain environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties  and such risks and liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
the development of our proved undeveloped reserves may take longer and may require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate 
as of december   of our total reserves were proved undeveloped reserves 
development of these reserves may take longer and require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate 
therefore  ultimate recoveries from these fields may not match current expectations 
delays in the development of our reserves or increases in costs to drill and develop such reserves will reduce the pv value of our estimated proved undeveloped reserves and future net revenues estimated for such reserves 
a significant portion of our operations are located in west texas  northwest oklahoma and kansas  making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in a limited number of major geographic areas 
as of december   approximately of our proved reserves and approximately of our annual production were located in the permian basin  mid continent and wto 
this concentration could disproportionately expose us to operational and regulatory risk in these areas 
this relative lack of diversification in location of our key operations could expose us to adverse developments in these areas or the oil and natural gas markets  including  for example  transportation or treatment capacity constraints  curtailment of production or treatment plant closures for scheduled maintenance 
these factors could have a significantly greater impact on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows than if our properties were more diversified 

table of contents our development and exploration operations require substantial capital  and we may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms  which could lead to a loss of properties and a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves 
the oil and natural gas industry is capital intensive 
we make substantial capital expenditures in our business and operations for the exploration  development  production and acquisition of oil and natural gas reserves 
historically  we have financed capital expenditures primarily with proceeds from asset sales and from the sale of equity  debt and cash generated by operations 
we will finance our future capital expenditures with the sale of equity and debt securities  cash flow from operations  asset sales and current and new financing arrangements 
our cash flow from operations and access to capital are subject to a number of variables  including our proved reserves  the level of oil and natural gas we are able to produce from existing wells  the prices at which oil and natural gas are sold  and our ability to acquire  locate and produce new reserves 
if our revenues decrease as a result of lower oil and natural gas prices  operating difficulties  declines in reserves or for any other reason  we may have limited ability to obtain the capital necessary to sustain our operations at current levels 
in order to fund our capital expenditures  we may seek additional financing 
however  our senior credit facility contains covenants limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness  which our lenders may withhold in their sole discretion 
our senior note indentures also contain covenants that may restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness if we do not satisfy certain financial metrics 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing  it may be necessary for us to reduce or suspend our capital expenditures 
continuing disruptions in the global financial and capital markets also could adversely affect our ability to obtain debt or equity financing on favorable terms  or at all 
the failure to obtain additional financing could result in a curtailment of our operations relating to exploration and development of our prospects  which in turn could lead to a possible loss of properties and a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves 
the agreements governing our existing indebtedness have restrictions  financial covenants and borrowing base redeterminations which could adversely affect our operations 
our senior credit facility and the indentures governing our senior notes restrict our ability to obtain additional financing  make investments  lease equipment  sell assets and engage in business combinations 
we also are required to comply with certain financial covenants and ratios 
our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants in the future is uncertain and will be affected by the levels of cash flow from our operations and events or circumstances beyond our control 
if commodity prices decline  this could adversely affect our ability to meet such restrictions and covenants 
our failure to comply with any of the restrictions and covenants under the senior credit facility  senior notes or other debt financing could result in a default under those instruments  which could cause all of our existing indebtedness to be immediately due and payable 
our senior credit facility limits the amounts we can borrow to a borrowing base amount 
the borrowing base is subject to review semi annually  however  the lenders reserve the right to have one additional re determination of the borrowing base per calendar year 
unscheduled re determinations may be made at our request  but are limited to two requests per year 
borrowing base determinations are based upon proved developed producing reserves  proved developed non producing reserves and proved undeveloped reserves 
outstanding borrowings exceeding the borrowing base must be repaid immediately  or we must pledge other oil and natural gas properties as additional collateral 
because of this  we may not have the financial resources in the future to make any mandatory principal prepayments under the senior credit facility  which are required  for example  when the committed line of credit is exceeded  proceeds of asset sales in new oil and natural gas properties are not reinvested  or indebtedness that is not permitted by the terms of the senior credit facility is incurred 
if the indebtedness under our senior credit facility and senior notes were to be accelerated  our assets may not be sufficient to repay such indebtedness in full 

table of contents our derivative activities could result in financial losses and could reduce our earnings 
to achieve a more predictable cash flow and to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in the prices of oil and natural gas  we currently have  and may in the future  enter into derivative contracts for a portion of our oil and natural gas production  including collars  basis swaps and fixed price swaps 
as of december   we had oil price swaps of  mbbls at an average price of per mbbl for   mbbls at an average price of per mbbl for and  mbbls at an average price of per mbbl for we also had natural gas price swaps of bcf at an average price of per mcf in place for and bcf at an average price of per mcf for the company also has natural gas basis swaps in place through for bcf at an average price of per mcf and natural gas collars in place through for bcf with an average floor price of and an average ceiling price of 
we have not and do not plan to designate any of our derivative contracts as hedges for accounting purposes and  as a result  record all derivative contracts on our balance sheet at fair value 
changes in the fair value of our derivative contracts are recognized in current period earnings 
accordingly  our earnings may fluctuate significantly as a result of changes in fair value of our derivative contracts 
derivative contracts also expose us to the risk of financial loss in some circumstances  including when production is less than expected  the counterparty to the derivative contract defaults on its contract obligations  or there is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the derivative contract and actual prices received 
in addition  these types of derivative contracts limit the benefit we would receive from increases in the prices for oil and natural gas 
all of our consolidated drilling and services revenues are derived from companies in the oil and natural gas industry 
companies to which we provide drilling and related services are affected by the oil and natural gas industry risks mentioned above 
market prices of oil and natural gas  limited access to capital and reductions in capital expenditures could result in oil and natural gas companies canceling or curtailing their drilling programs  which could reduce the demand for our drilling and related services 
any prolonged reduction in the overall level of exploration and development activities  whether resulting from changes in oil and natural gas prices or otherwise  could impact our drilling and services segment by negatively affecting revenues  cash flow and profitability  our ability to retain skilled rig personnel whom we would need in the event of an upturn in the demand for drilling and related services  and the fair value of our rig fleet 
a significant decrease in natural gas production in our areas of operations  due to declines in production from existing wells  depressed commodity prices or otherwise  would adversely affect our ability to satisfy certain contractual obligations and revenues and cash flow from our midstream gas services segment 
in june  we sold an entity  pi on gathering company  llc pgc  holding our gathering and compression assets located in the pi on field  which is part of the wto in pecos county  texas  to an unaffiliated third party 
in conjunction with the sale  we entered into a gas gathering agreement pursuant to which we dedicated our pi on field acreage to pgc for gathering services for years 
during that period  we have minimum throughput and delivery obligations to pgc 
in addition  we continue to construct gathering and compression assets in the pi on field 
most of the reserves supporting our contractual obligations to pgc and our own midstream assets are operated by our exploration and production segment 
a material decrease in natural gas production in our areas of operation would result in a decline in the volume of natural gas delivered to 
table of contents pgc and our pipelines and facilities for gathering  transporting and treating 
we have no control over many factors affecting production activity  including prevailing and projected energy prices  demand for hydrocarbons  the level of reserves  geological considerations  governmental regulation and the availability and cost of capital 
we are obligated to pay minimum fees under the gas gathering agreement with pgc if we do not satisfy the contractual throughput and delivery commitments to pgc  due  for example  to our failure to connect new wells to pgc s gathering systems or when there is a decline in the amount of natural gas that we produce from the pi on field 
in addition  if we fail to connect new wells to our own gathering systems  the amount of natural gas we gather  transport and treat will decline substantially over time and could  upon exhaustion of the current wells  cause us to abandon our gathering systems and  possibly cease gathering  transporting and treating operations 
many of our prospects in the wto may contain natural gas that is high in co content  which can negatively affect our economics 
the reservoirs of many of our prospects in the wto may contain natural gas that is high in co content 
the natural gas produced from these reservoirs must be treated for the removal of co prior to marketing 
if we cannot obtain sufficient capacity at treatment facilities for our natural gas with a high co concentration  or if the cost to obtain such capacity significantly increases  we could be forced to delay production and development or experience increased production costs 
we will not know the amount of co that we will encounter in any well until it is drilled 
as a result  sometimes we encounter co levels in our wells that are higher than expected 
since the treatment expenses are incurred on a mcf basis  we will incur a higher effective treating cost per mmbtu of natural gas sold for natural gas with a higher co content 
as a result  high co gas wells must produce at much higher rates than low co gas wells to be economic  especially in a low natural gas price environment 
furthermore  when we treat the gas for the removal of co  some of the methane is used to run the treatment plant as fuel gas and other methane and heavier hydrocarbons  such as ethane  propane and butane  cannot be separated from the co and is lost 
this is known as plant shrink 
historically our plant shrink has been approximately in the wto 
after giving effect to plant shrink  as many as mcf of high co natural gas must be produced to sell one mmbtu of natural gas 
we report our volumes of natural gas reserves and production net of co volumes that are removed prior to sales 
our use of d and d seismic data is subject to interpretation and may not accurately identify the presence of oil and natural gas 
in addition  the use of such technology requires greater predrilling expenditures  which could adversely affect the results of our drilling operations 
a significant aspect of our exploration and development plan involves seismic data 
even when properly used and interpreted  d and d seismic data and visualization techniques are only tools used to assist geoscientists in identifying subsurface structures and hydrocarbon indicators and do not enable the interpreter to know whether hydrocarbons are present in those structures 
other geologists and petroleum professionals  when studying the same seismic data  may have significantly different interpretations than our professionals 
in addition  the use of d and d seismic and other advanced technologies requires greater predrilling expenditures than traditional drilling strategies  and we could incur losses due to such expenditures 
as a result  our drilling activities may not be geologically successful or economical  and our overall drilling success rate or our drilling success rate for activities in a particular area may not improve 
we may often gather d and d seismic data over large areas 
our interpretation of seismic data delineates for us those portions of an area that we believe are desirable for drilling 
therefore  we may choose not to acquire option or lease rights prior to acquiring seismic data  and in many cases  we may identify hydrocarbon indicators before seeking option or lease rights in the location 
if we are not able to lease those locations on acceptable terms  we will have made substantial expenditures to acquire and analyze d and d data without having an opportunity to attempt to benefit from those expenditures 

table of contents drilling for and producing oil and natural gas are high risk activities with many uncertainties that could adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our drilling and operating activities are subject to many risks  including the risk that we will not discover commercially productive reservoirs 
drilling for oil and natural gas can be unprofitable if dry wells are drilled and if productive wells do not produce sufficient revenues to return a profit 
in addition  our drilling and producing operations may be curtailed  delayed or canceled as a result of other factors  including delays imposed by or resulting from compliance with regulatory requirements including permitting  unusual or unexpected geological formations and miscalculations  shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment and qualified personnel  equipment malfunctions  failures or accidents  lack of available gathering facilities or delays in construction of gathering facilities  lack of available capacity on interconnecting transmission pipelines  unexpected operational events and drilling conditions  pipe or cement failures  casing collapses  pressures  fires and blowouts  lost or damaged drilling and service tools  loss of drilling fluid circulation  uncontrollable flows of oil and natural gas  water or drilling fluids  natural disasters  environmental hazards  such as oil and natural gas leaks  pipeline ruptures and discharges of toxic gases  adverse weather conditions and natural disasters  reductions in oil and natural gas prices  oil and natural gas property title problems  and market limitations for oil and natural gas 
any of these risks can cause substantial losses  including personal injury or loss of life  damage to or destruction of property  natural resources and equipment  pollution  environmental contamination or loss of wells and regulatory fines or penalties 
insurance against all operational risks is not available to us 
additionally  we may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the perceived risks presented 
we could incur losses for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts exceeding existing insurance coverage 
the occurrence of an event that is not covered in full or in part by insurance could have a material adverse impact on our business activities  financial condition and results of operations 
the high cost or unavailability of drilling rigs  equipment  supplies  personnel and other oil field services could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans on a timely basis and within our budget 
our industry is cyclical and  from time to time  there is a shortage of drilling rigs  equipment  supplies or qualified personnel 
during these periods  the costs of rigs  equipment  supplies and personnel are substantially greater and their availability may be limited 
additionally  these services may not be available on commercially reasonable terms 

table of contents market conditions or operational impediments may hinder our access to oil and natural gas markets or delay our production 
market conditions or a lack of satisfactory oil and natural gas transportation arrangements may hinder our access to oil and natural gas markets or delay our production 
the availability of a ready market for our oil and natural gas production depends on a number of factors  including the demand for and supply of oil and natural gas and the proximity of reserves to pipelines and terminal facilities 
our ability to market our production depends  in substantial part  on the availability and capacity of gathering systems  pipelines and treating facilities 
for example  in we experienced capacity limitations on high co gas treating in the pi on field 
our failure to obtain such services on acceptable terms in the future or expand our midstream assets could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we may be required to shut in wells for a lack of a market or because access to natural gas pipelines  gathering system capacity or treating facilities may be limited or unavailable 
we would be unable to realize revenue from any shut in wells until production arrangements were made to deliver the production to market 
competition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense  which may adversely affect our ability to succeed 
the oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive  and we compete with companies that have greater resources than we do 
many of these companies not only explore for and produce oil and natural gas  but also carry on refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional  national or worldwide basis 
these companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects or identify  evaluate  bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit 
in addition  these companies may have a greater ability to continue exploration activities during periods of low oil and natural gas market prices 
our larger competitors may be able to absorb the burden of present and future federal  state  local and other laws and regulations more easily than we can  which would adversely affect our competitive position 
our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment 
in addition  because we have fewer financial and human resources than many companies in our industry  we may be at a disadvantage in bidding for exploratory prospects and producing oil and natural gas properties 
see business competition in item of this report 
downturns in oil and natural gas prices can result in decreased oil field activity which  in turn  can result in an oversupply of service providers and drilling rigs 
this oversupply can result in severe reductions in prices received for oil field services or a complete lack of work for crews and equipment 
we are subject to complex federal  state  local and other laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost  manner or feasibility of conducting our operations or expose us to significant liabilities 
our oil and natural gas exploration  production  transportation and treatment operations are subject to complex and stringent laws and regulations 
in order to conduct our operations in compliance with these laws and regulations  we must obtain and maintain numerous permits  approvals and certificates from various federal  state and local governmental authorities 
we may incur substantial costs in order to maintain compliance with these existing laws and regulations 
further  in light of the explosion and fire on the drilling rig deepwater horizon in the gulf of mexico  as well as incidents involving the release of oil and natural gas and fluids as a result of drilling activities in the united states  there has been a variety of regulatory initiatives at the federal and state level to restrict oil and natural gas drilling operations in certain locations 
any increased regulation or suspension of oil and natural gas exploration and production  or revision or reinterpretation of existing laws and regulations  that arises out of these incidents or otherwise could result in delays and higher operating costs 
such costs or significant delays could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we must also comply with laws and regulations prohibiting fraud and market manipulations in energy markets 
to the extent we are a shipper on interstate pipelines  we must comply with tariffs of such pipelines and with federal policies related to the use of interstate capacity 

table of contents laws and regulations governing oil and natural gas exploration and production may also affect production levels 
we are required to comply with federal and state laws and regulations governing conservation matters  including provisions related to the unitization or pooling of the oil and natural gas properties  the establishment of maximum rates of production from wells  the spacing of wells  and the plugging and abandonment of wells 
these and other laws and regulations can limit the amount of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells  limit the number of wells we can drill  or limit the locations at which we can conduct drilling operations 
new laws or regulations  or changes to existing laws or regulations may unfavorably impact us  could result in increased operating costs and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
for example  congress is currently considering legislation that  if adopted in its proposed form  would subject companies involved in oil and natural gas and oil exploration and production activities to  among other items  additional regulation of and restrictions on hydraulic fracturing of wells  the elimination of most us federal tax incentives and deductions available to oil and natural gas exploration and production activities  and the prohibition or additional regulation of private energy commodity derivative and hedging activities 
additionally  state and federal regulatory authorities may expand or alter applicable pipeline safety laws and regulations  compliance with which may require increased capital costs on the part of us and third party downstream oil and natural gas transporters 
these and other potential regulations could increase our operating costs  reduce our liquidity  delay our operations  increase direct and third party post production costs or otherwise alter the way we conducts our business  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows and which could reduce cash received by or available for distribution  including any amounts paid by us for transportation on downstream interstate pipelines 
our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations that may result in significant costs and liabilities 
our oil and natural gas exploration and production operations are subject to stringent and comprehensive federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection 
these laws and regulations may impose numerous obligations that are applicable to our operations including the acquisition of a permit before conducting drilling  water withdrawal or waste disposal activities  the restriction of types  quantities and concentration of materials that can be released into the environment  the limitation or prohibition of drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness  wetlands and other protected areas  and the imposition of substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from operations 
numerous governmental authorities  such as the us environmental protection agency epa and analogous state agencies  have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them  often requiring difficult and costly actions 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative  civil or criminal penalties  the imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations  and the issuance of injunctions limiting or preventing some or all of our operations 
there is inherent risk of incurring significant environmental costs and liabilities in the performance of our operations due to its handling of petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes  because of air emissions and wastewater discharges related to its operations  and as a result of historical industry operations and waste disposal practices 
under certain environmental laws and regulations  we could be subject to joint and several strict liability for the removal or remediation of previously released materials or property contamination regardless of whether we were responsible for the release or contamination or if the operations were not in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken 
private parties  including the owners of properties upon which our wells are drilled and facilities where our petroleum hydrocarbons or wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance  as well as to seek damages for non compliance  with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage 
in addition  the risk of accidental spills or releases could expose us to significant liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
changes in environmental laws and regulations occur 
table of contents frequently  and any changes that result in more stringent or costly waste handling  storage  transport  disposal or cleanup requirements could require us to make significant expenditures to attain and maintain compliance and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on its results of operations  competitive position or financial condition 
we may not be able to recover some or any of these costs from insurance 
as a result of the increased cost of compliance  we may decide to discontinue drilling 
the century plant may not operate or perform as intended 
we are constructing the century plant  a co treatment plant in pecos county  texas  and associated compression and pipeline facilities pursuant to an agreement with a subsidiary of occidental 
the century plant will be owned and operated by occidental for the purpose of separating and removing co from natural gas delivered by us 
pursuant to a year treating agreement executed simultaneously with the construction agreement  occidental will remove co from our delivered production volumes 
there are significant risks associated with the operation and performance of a facility such as the century plant 
in addition  there is no guarantee that we will be able to construct the century plant within the budgeted amount or find  produce and deliver enough high co gas to satisfy our delivery obligations or that the century plant will operate at its designed capacity or otherwise perform as anticipated 
we may not realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions  and integration of acquisitions may disrupt our business and management 
in the future  we may acquire other companies or large asset packages  as we have done in the past 
we may not realize the anticipated benefits of an acquisition and each acquisition has numerous risks 
these risks include difficulty in assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired company  difficulty in maintaining controls  procedures and policies during the transition and integration  disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of our management and employees from other opportunities and challenges  difficulty integrating the acquired company s accounting  management information  human resources and other administrative systems  inability to retain key personnel of the acquired business  inability to achieve the financial and strategic goals for the acquired and combined businesses  inability to take advantage of anticipated tax benefits  potential failure of the due diligence processes to identify significant problems  liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired business  exposure to litigation or other claims in connection with  or inheritance of claims or litigation risk as a result of  an acquisition  including but not limited to  claims from terminated employees  customers  former stockholders or other third parties  potential inability to assert that internal controls over financial reporting are effective  and potential incompatibility of business cultures 
repercussions from terrorist activities or armed conflict could harm our business 
terrorist activities  anti terrorist efforts or other armed conflict involving the united states or its interests abroad may adversely affect the united states and global economies and could prevent us from meeting our financial and other obligations 
if events of this nature occur and persist  the attendant political instability and societal disruption could reduce overall demand for oil and natural gas  potentially putting downward pressure on 
table of contents prevailing oil and natural gas prices and causing a reduction in our revenues 
oil and natural gas production facilities  transportation systems and storage facilities could be direct targets of terrorist attacks  and or operations could be adversely impacted if infrastructure integral to our operations is destroyed by such an attack 
costs for insurance and other security may increase as a result of these threats  and some insurance coverage may become more difficult to obtain  if available at all 
if we fail to maintain an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting  it could adversely affect our ability to accurately report our results 
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting 
our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
a material weakness is a deficiency  or a combination of deficiencies  in our internal control over financial reporting that results in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 
effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent material fraud 
if we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent material fraud  our reputation and operating results would be harmed 
our efforts to develop and maintain our internal controls may not be successful  and we may be unable to maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future  including future compliance with the obligations under section of the sarbanes oxley act of any failure to develop or maintain effective controls  or difficulties encountered in their implementation  including those related to acquired businesses  or other effective improvement of our internal controls could harm our operating results 
ineffective internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information 
certain us federal income tax preferences currently available with respect to oil and natural gas production may be eliminated as a result of future legislation 
among the changes contained in president obama s budget proposal for fiscal year is the elimination of certain key us federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and gas exploration and production 
the president s budget proposes to eliminate certain tax preferences applicable to taxpayers engaged in the exploration or production of natural resources 
specifically  the budget proposes to repeal the deduction for percentage depletion with respect to wells  in which case only cost depletion would be available 
it is unclear whether any such changes will be enacted or how soon any such changes could become effective 
the passage of any legislation as a result of these proposals or any other similar changes in us federal income tax laws could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 
new derivatives legislation and regulation could adversely affect our ability to hedge risks associated with our business 
the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank act creates a new regulatory framework for oversight of derivatives transactions by the commodity futures trading commission the cftc and the sec 
among other things  the dodd frank act subjects certain swap participants to new capital  margin and business conduct standards 
in addition  the dodd frank act contemplates that where appropriate in light of outstanding exposures  trading liquidity and other factors  swaps broadly defined to include most hedging instruments other than futures will be required to be cleared through a registered clearing facility and traded on a designated exchange or swap execution facility 
the dodd frank act also establishes a new energy and environmental markets advisory committee to make recommendations to the cftc regarding matters of concern to exchanges  firms  end users and regulators with respect to energy and environmental markets and also expands the cftc s power to impose position limits on specific categories of swaps excluding swaps entered into for bona fide hedging purposes 
there are some exceptions to these requirements for entities that use swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk 
while we may qualify for one or more of such exceptions  the scope of these exceptions is uncertain and 
table of contents will be further defined through rulemaking proceedings at the cftc and sec 
further  although we may qualify for exceptions  our derivatives counterparties may be subject to new capital  margin and business conduct requirements imposed as a result of the new legislation  which may increase our transaction costs or make it more difficult for us to enter into hedging transactions on favorable terms 
our inability to enter into hedging transactions on favorable terms  or at all  could increase our operating expenses and put us at increased exposure to risks of adverse changes in oil and natural gas prices  which could adversely affect the predictability of cash flows from sales of oil and natural gas 
in january  the cftc proposed rules to establish a position limits regime on certain core physical delivery contracts and their economically equivalent derivatives  some of which reference major energy commodities  including oil and natural gas 
the cftc also indicated that it intends to propose a process for determining what other swaps may be subject to position limits 
although it is not possible at this time to predict the consequences that would arise from implementing these proposals  any regulations that are adopted that subject us or our derivatives counterparties to additional capital or margin requirements relating to  or impose additional restrictions on  our trading and commodity positions could have an adverse effect on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business or on the cost of our hedging activity 
federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays as well as adversely affect our services 
hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons from tight formations 
the process involves the injection of water  sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production 
the process is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions but is not subject to regulation at the federal level 
the epa has commenced a study of the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing activities  with results of the study anticipated to be available by late  and a committee of the us house of representatives is also conducting an investigation of hydraulic fracturing practices 
legislation has been introduced before congress to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process 
in addition  some states have adopted  and other states are considering adopting  regulations that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances 
if new laws or regulations that significantly restrict or regulate hydraulic fracturing are adopted  such legal requirements could make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing to stimulate production from a formation and thereby affect the determination of whether a well is commercially viable 
restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we are ultimately able to produce in commercial quantities 
climate change laws and regulations restricting emissions of greenhouse gases could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce while the physical effects of climate change could disrupt our production and cause us to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to those effects 
on december   the epa published its findings that emissions of ghgs present a danger to public health and the environment 
these findings allow the agency to adopt and implement regulations that would restrict emissions of ghgs under existing provisions of the federal clean air act 
accordingly  the epa has proposed regulations that would require a reduction in emissions of ghgs from motor vehicles and adopted regulations that could trigger permit review for ghg emissions from certain stationary sources 
in addition  on october   the epa published a final rule requiring the reporting of ghg emissions from specified large ghg emission sources in the united states  beginning in for emissions occurring in on november   the epa published a final rule that expands its october final rule on reporting of ghg emissions to include owners and operators of onshore oil and natural gas production  effective december  both houses of congress have actively considered legislation to reduce emissions of ghgs and the obama administration has indicated its support for legislation to reduce ghg emissions through an emission allowance system 
at the state level  almost one half of the states  either individually or through multi state regional 
table of contents initiatives  already have begun implementing legal measures to reduce emissions of ghgs 
the adoption and implementation of any regulations imposing reporting obligations on  or limiting emissions of ghgs from  our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of ghgs associated with its operations or could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas that it produces 
finally  it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the earth s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects  such as increased frequency and severity of storms  droughts  and floods and other climatic events  if any such effects were to occur  they could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations

introduction the following discussion and analysis is intended to help the reader understand our business  financial condition  results of operations  liquidity and capital resources 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with other sections of this report  including business in item  selected financial data in item and financial statements and supplementary data in item our discussion and analysis relates to the following subjects overview of our company results by segment results of operations liquidity and capital resources critical accounting policies and estimates new accounting pronouncements overview of our company we are an independent oil and natural gas company concentrating on development and production activities related to the exploitation of our significant holdings in west texas and the mid continent area of oklahoma and kansas 
our primary areas of focus are the permian basin in west texas  the mississippian formation in the mid continent and the wto 
we also own and operate other interests in the mid continent  cotton valley trend in east texas  gulf coast and gulf of mexico 
beginning in  we began expanding the oil component of our property base 
included in this expansion was the purchase of properties from forest in december and the arena acquisition in july  which are both in the permian basin area 
concurrent with our permian acquisitions  we have focused on significantly growing oil production from our existing properties in the mid continent 
we operate businesses that are complementary to our development and production activities 
we own related gas gathering and treating facilities  a gas marketing business and an oil field services business 
the 
table of contents extent to which each of these supplemental businesses contributes to our consolidated results of operations largely is determined by the amount of work each performs for third parties 
revenues and costs related to work performed by these businesses for our own account are eliminated in consolidation and  therefore  do not directly contribute to our consolidated results of operations 
we currently generate the majority of our consolidated revenues and cash flow from the production and sale of oil and natural gas 
our revenues  profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for oil and natural gas and on our ability to find and economically develop and produce oil and natural gas reserves 
prices for oil and natural gas fluctuate widely 
in order to reduce our exposure to these fluctuations  we enter into derivative commodity contracts for a portion of our anticipated future oil and natural gas production 
reducing our exposure to price volatility helps ensure that we have adequate funds available for our capital expenditure programs 

table of contents results by segment we operate in three business segments exploration and production  drilling and oil field services and midstream gas services 
the all other column in the tables below includes items not related to our reportable segments such as our co gathering and sales operations and corporate operations 
management evaluates the performance of our business segments based on operating income loss  which is defined as segment operating revenues less operating expenses 
results of these measurements provide important information to us about the activity and profitability of our lines of business 
set forth in the table below is financial information regarding each of our business segments for the years ended december   and in thousands

the operating loss for the exploration and production segment for the years ended december  and includes non cash full cost ceiling impairments of  million and  million  respectively  on our oil and natural gas properties 
the operating loss for the midstream gas services segment for the year ended december  includes a million loss on the sale of our gathering and compression assets in the pi on field 

table of contents exploration and production segment the primary factors affecting the financial results of our exploration and production segment are the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production  the quantity of oil and natural gas we produce and changes in the fair value of commodity derivative contracts we use to reduce the volatility of the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production 
annual comparisons of production and price data are presented in the tables below 
changes in our results for these periods reflect the strategic movement toward increased oil production in  including the acquisition of oil and natural gas properties from forest in december and arena in july  which increased production volumes and associated oil and natural gas revenues

table of contents as of december   we had mmboe or  bcfe of estimated net proved reserves with a pv of  million  compared to mmboe or  bcfe of estimated net proved reserves with a pv of  million as of december  our standardized measure was  million at december  compared to  million at december  and  million at december  the increase in pv in is primarily attributable to reserves acquired in the arena acquisition and higher commodity prices during compared to for a discussion of pv and reconciliation to standardized measure  see business our business and primary operations proved reserves in item of this report 
exploration and production segment year ended december  compared to year ended december  exploration and production segment revenues increased million  or  to million in the year ended december  from million in  primarily as a result of the increase in oil production  slightly offset by the decrease in natural gas production volumes 
also contributing to the increase was a increase in the combined average price we received on our oil and natural gas production 
in the year ended december   oil production increased by  mbbls to  mbbls 
the increase in oil production was due to the addition of permian basin properties acquired from forest and arena  and a focus on increased oil drilling in we produced  mbbls of oil for the year ended december  from the properties acquired from forest and arena 
the bcf decrease in natural gas production was a result of the decline in the number of rigs drilling for natural gas during due to depressed natural gas prices and our strategic shift to increased oil drilling 
the average price received for our oil production increased  or per barrel  to per barrel during the year ended december  from per barrel in the average price we received for our natural gas production for the year ended december  increased  or per mcf  to per mcf from per mcf in including the impact of derivative contract settlements  the effective price received for oil for the year ended december  was per bbl compared to per bbl in including the impact of derivative contract settlements  the effective price received for natural gas for the year ended december  was per mcf compared to per mcf in due to the long term nature of our investment in the development of our properties  we enter into oil and natural gas swaps and collars for a portion of our production in order to stabilize future cash inflows for planning purposes 
our derivative contracts are not designated as hedges and  as a result  gains or losses on commodity derivative contracts are recorded as a component of operating expenses 
internally  management views the settlement of such derivative contracts as adjustments to the price received for oil and natural gas production to determine effective prices 
realized gains or losses from the settlement of derivative contracts with contractual maturities outside of the reporting period are not considered in the calculation of effective prices 
during the year ended december   the exploration and production segment reported a million net loss on our commodity derivative positions million realized gain and million unrealized loss compared to a million net gain on our commodity derivative positions million realized gain and million unrealized loss in the realized gain of million for the year ended december  was primarily due to lower natural gas prices at the time of settlement compared to the contract price 
realized gains totaling million resulting from settlements of commodity derivative contracts with original contractual maturities after the quarterly period in which they were settled were included in the realized gain for the year ended december  unrealized gains or losses on derivative contracts represent the change in fair value of open derivative contracts during the period 
the unrealized loss on our commodity contracts recorded during the year ended december  was primarily attributable to an increase in average oil prices at december  compared to the average oil prices at december  or the contract price for contracts entered into during and the settlement of natural gas price swaps during the year ended december  the unrealized loss for the year ended december  was attributable to increased average oil and natural gas prices and decreases in the price differentials on our basis swaps at december  
table of contents for the year ended december   we had operating income of million in our exploration and production segment compared to an operating loss of  million in the million increase in oil and natural gas revenues and the absence of a full cost pool ceiling impairment were partially offset by the million net loss on commodity derivative contracts  a million increase in production expenses  a million increase in production taxes and a million increase in depreciation and depletion on oil and natural gas properties 
see discussion of production expense  production taxes and depreciation and depletion under consolidated results of operations below 
exploration and production segment year ended december  compared to year ended december  exploration and production segment revenues decreased to million for the year ended december  from million in  as a result of a decrease in the average price we received for the oil and natural gas we produced  offset slightly by a increase in combined production volumes 
during  we increased oil production by mbbls to  mbbls and increased natural gas production slightly by mmcf to bcf 
the total combined mboe or bcfe increase in production was primarily due to the increased oil production resulting from new wells in west texas and the permian basin 
the average price received for our oil production decreased to per bbl from per bbl in the average price we received for our natural gas production for the year ended december  decreased per mcf  or  to per mcf from per mcf in the average price we received for our oil and natural gas production was negatively impacted by the continued decline in oil and natural gas prices experienced by the industry during our oil derivative contract settlements increased our effective price received for oil by per bbl to per bbl for the year ended december  our oil derivative contract settlements decreased our effective price received for oil by per bbl to per bbl for the year ended december  including the impact of derivative contract settlements  the effective average price received for natural gas for the year ended december  was per mcf compared to per mcf during during the year ended december   the exploration and production segment reported a million net gain on our commodity derivative contracts million realized gain and million unrealized loss compared to a million net gain million realized loss and million unrealized gain in the realized gain of million for the year ended december  was primarily due to a decline in natural gas prices at the time of settlement compared to the contract price 
the unrealized loss on oil and natural gas derivative contracts recorded during the year ended december  was attributable to an increase in average oil and natural gas prices at december  compared to the average oil and natural gas prices at december  or the contract price for contracts entered into during for the year ended december   we had an operating loss of  million in our exploration and production segment  compared to an operating loss of  million in the operating loss for the year ended december  was attributable to the million decrease in exploration and production segment revenues and the full cost ceiling impairments totaling  million  partially offset by million in net gain on our commodity derivative contracts and a million decrease in depreciation and depletion on oil and natural gas properties due to the decrease in the average depreciation and depletion per unit 
the full cost ceiling impairments were the result of the decline in the future value of our reserves based on the oil and natural gas prices at march  and the month average prices at december  under sec rules that became effective december   oil and natural gas reserves were calculated based on the average price during the month period  using the first day of the month price for each month in the period instead of the one day period end pricing method previously used 
as a result of lower oil and natural gas prices during  which were used to determine the future value of our reserves  we were required to record a ceiling impairment of million at december   in addition to the  million ceiling impairment recorded at march  
table of contents drilling and oil field services segment the financial results of our drilling and oil field services segment depend primarily on demand and the price we can charge for our services 
in addition to providing drilling services  our oil field services business also conducts operations that complement our exploration and production segment such as providing pulling units  trucking  rental tools  location and road construction and roustabout services 
on a consolidated basis  drilling and oil field service revenues earned and expenses incurred in performing services for third parties  including third party working interests in wells we operate  are included in drilling and services revenues and expenses while drilling and oil field service revenues earned and expenses incurred in performing services for our own account are eliminated in consolidation 
as of december   we owned drilling rigs  through lariat

although our ownership in larclay afforded us access to larclay s rigs  we did not control larclay  and  therefore  did not consolidate the results of its operations with ours 
only the activities of our wholly owned drilling and oil field services subsidiaries are included in the financial results of our drilling and oil field services segment 
on april   lariat completed an assignment to cwei of lariat s equity interest in larclay pursuant to the terms of an assignment and assumption agreement the larclay assignment entered into between lariat and cwei 
pursuant to the larclay assignment  lariat assigned all of its right  title and interest in and to larclay to cwei effective as of april   and cwei assumed all of the obligations and liabilities of lariat relating to larclay 
we fully impaired our investment in and notes receivable due from larclay at december  there were no additional losses on larclay during the year ended december  or as a result of the larclay assignment 
drilling and oil field services segment year ended december  compared to year ended december  drilling and oil field services segment revenues increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  and drilling and oil field services segment expenses decreased million to million during the same period 
the increase in revenues resulted in a reduced operating loss of million in the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in the increase in revenues was primarily attributable to an increase in services performed for third parties during as we had more rigs drilling for third parties during than during during  an average of four rigs were working for third parties compared to an average of one rig working for third parties during additionally  the average daily rate received per rig working for third parties increased to an average of  per rig per working day during compared to an average of  per rig per working day during the reduced  or stand by  rates received on two of our rigs during resulted in a lower average rate per rig per working day in during  none of our rigs received stand by rates 

table of contents drilling and oil field services segment year ended december  compared to year ended december  drilling and oil field services segment revenues decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this resulted in an operating loss of million during compared to an operating loss of million during the decline in revenues and operating income was primarily attributable to a decrease in the number of our rigs operating and decreases in services performed for third parties as well as lower operating margins during compared to during  an average of of the operational rigs we owned were working compared to an average of of the operational rigs working during additionally  the average daily rate received per rig working for third parties declined to an average of  per rig per working day during from an average of  per rig per working day during we received reduced  or stand by  rates on two of our rigs during  which resulted in a lower average rate per rig per working day for the year ended december  than the comparable period in midstream gas services segment midstream gas services segment revenues consist mostly of revenue from gas marketing  which is a very low margin business 
midstream gas services are primarily undertaken to realize incremental margins on natural gas purchased at the wellhead  and provide value added services to customers 
on a consolidated basis  midstream and marketing revenues represent natural gas sold on behalf of third parties and the fees we charge related to gathering  compressing and treating this natural gas 
gas marketing operating costs represent payments made to third parties for the proceeds from the sale of natural gas owned by such parties  net of any applicable margin and actual costs we charge to gather  compress and treat the natural gas 
in general  natural gas purchased and sold by our midstream gas business is priced at a published daily or monthly index price 
sales to wholesale customers typically incorporate a premium for managing their transmission and balancing requirements 
the primary factors affecting the results of our midstream gas services segment are the quantity of natural gas we gather  treat and market and the prices we pay and receive for natural gas 
in june  we completed the sale of our gathering and compression assets located in the pi on field 
net proceeds from the sale were approximately million  which resulted in a loss on the sale of million 
in conjunction with the sale  we entered into a gas gathering agreement and an operations and maintenance agreement 
under the gas gathering agreement  we have dedicated our pi on field acreage for priority gathering services for a period of years and we will pay a fee for such services that was negotiated at arms length 
pursuant to the operations and maintenance agreement  we will operate and maintain the gathering system assets sold for a period of years unless we or the buyer of the assets chooses to terminate the agreement 
grey ranch plant  lp grlp is a limited partnership that operates the grey ranch plant we own that is located in pecos county  texas 
we purchased our investment in grlp during during october  we executed amendments to certain agreements related to the ownership and operation of grlp 
as a result of these amendments  we became the primary beneficiary of grlp 
due to this change  we began consolidating the activity of grlp in our midstream gas services segment prospectively beginning on the effective date of the amendments  october  midstream gas services segment year ended december  compared to year ended december  midstream gas services segment revenues for the year ended december  were million compared to million in the same period in operating income was million for the year ended december  compared to an operating loss of million in the increase in natural gas prices for third party volumes we marketed in the year ended december  compared to contributed to the increase in revenues 
the consolidation of grlp activity into the midstream gas services segment for the year 
table of contents ended december  also contributed to the increase in midstream gas services segment revenues and to the increase in operating income 
prior to october  when we began consolidating grlp  our share of grlp activity was reported as income from equity investments 
the increase in operating income was primarily due to the inclusion of a million loss on the sale of our gathering and compression assets and a million impairment on our spare parts inventory in the year ended december  midstream gas services segment year ended december  compared to year ended december  midstream gas services segment revenues for the year ended december  were million compared to million in the decrease in midstream gas services revenues was attributable to an overall decrease in natural gas prices in compared to operating costs decreased in proportion to revenue based on the decrease in natural gas prices paid in compared to profit margin for was compared to a profit margin of for the operating loss of million for compared to operating income of million in was primarily attributable to the loss on the sale of our gathering and compression assets 
also contributing to the operating loss was the impairment of spare parts inventory recorded in consolidated results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues 
total revenues increased to million for the year ended december  from million in this increase is primarily due to the increase in oil and natural gas sales that resulted from increased oil production and increased prices received on our oil and natural gas production 
year ended december  change change in thousands revenues oil and natural gas drilling and services midstream and marketing other total revenues total oil and natural gas revenues increased million for the year ended december  compared to  primarily as a result of increased oil production  offset slightly by decreased natural gas production  and increased prices received for our oil and natural gas production 
the increase in oil production was primarily due to the addition of properties acquired from forest and arena and a focus on increased oil drilling in the combined average price received  excluding the impact of derivative contracts  for our oil and natural gas production increased in to per boe or per mcfe compared to per boe or per mcfe in drilling and services revenues increased for the year ended december  compared to the increase was due to an increase in the number of rigs drilling for third parties and an increase in the average revenue per rig per day 
midstream and marketing revenues increased million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the increase in revenues was primarily attributable to the inclusion of grlp activity for the year ended december   as previously discussed 
also contributing to the increase was an increase in the price of natural gas marketed for third parties 

table of contents operating costs and expenses 
total operating costs and expenses decreased to million during  compared to  million in  primarily due to the absence of a full cost ceiling impairment during the absence of a ceiling impairment was partially offset by increases in production expense  production taxes  midstream and marketing expense  depreciation and depletion  general and administrative expense and the loss on derivative contracts 
year ended december  change change in thousands operating costs and expenses production production taxes drilling and services midstream and marketing depreciation and depletion oil and natural gas depreciation and amortization other impairment general and administrative loss gain on derivative contracts loss on sale of assets total operating costs and expenses production expense includes the costs associated with our exploration and production activities  including  but not limited to  lease operating expense and treating costs 
production expense increased million for the year ended december  compared to primarily due to the addition of operating expenses associated with properties acquired from forest and arena 
also contributing to the increase were higher production costs associated with oil volumes compared to production costs on natural gas volumes 
oil production increased by  mbbls in to  mbbls from the comparable period in production taxes increased million due to the additional taxes for production from properties acquired from forest and arena and a decrease in the amount of high cost gas severance tax refunds received in the year ended december  compared to as a result  production taxes on a unit of production basis increased from per boe or per mcfe for to per boe or per mcfe for drilling and services expenses  which include operating expenses attributable to the drilling and oil field services segment and our co services companies  decreased million  or  for the year ended december  compared to due  in part  to higher co volumes used by us in the completion operations of wells on our oil and natural gas properties 
also contributing to the decrease in expense was the overall increase in rig activity and higher profit margins experienced in  which resulted in a higher amount of costs associated with the drilling business being allocated to the full cost pool and a decreased amount of such costs being expensed 
midstream and marketing expenses increased million  or  due to the consolidation of grlp activity as well as increased prices paid for natural gas purchased from third parties during compared to depreciation and depletion of our oil and natural gas properties increased to million for the year ended december  from million in the same period in the increase was primarily due to an increase in our depreciation and depletion rate to per boe or per mcfe in from per boe or per mcfe in as a result of an increase to our depreciable oil and natural gas properties  primarily due to the acquisition of properties from arena in july and forest in december 
table of contents during  we reduced the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties by  million due to full cost ceiling limitations at both march  and december  there were no full cost ceiling impairments recorded during there were additional impairment expenses of million and million in related to the decline in market value of our spare parts inventory and buildings that we determined will not have use or value in the future  respectively 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  for the year ended december  compared to due  in part  to a million increase in compensation costs resulting from an increase in non cash stock compensation and an increase in the number of employees and severance expense during the increased compensation costs are primarily a result of the arena acquisition 
also contributing to the increase was million in costs incurred related to our acquisition of arena  million for the settlement of a dispute with certain working interest owners and an increase of approximately million in professional services rendered to us 
we recorded a net loss of million million realized gain and million unrealized loss on our commodity derivative contracts for the year ended december  compared to a net gain of million million realized gain and million unrealized loss in see further discussion of gains and losses on commodity derivative contracts under results by segment exploration and production segment above 
loss on sale of assets decreased million  or  for the year ended december  from a million loss in  primarily due to a million loss recorded on the sale of our gathering and compression assets during the period 
other income expense 
total other expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million in the increase is reflected in the table below 
year ended december  change change in thousands other income expense interest income interest expense income from equity investments other income  net total other expense loss before income taxes income tax benefit net income loss interest expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million in this increase was primarily attributable to higher average debt balances outstanding during the year ended december  compared to mainly due to increased borrowings under our senior credit facility during the period and the issuance of our senior notes in may and our senior notes in december also contributing to the increase was a million net loss on our interest rate swaps for the year ended december  compared to a million net loss for other income  net decreased to million in from million in the decrease was due primarily to a break up fee received in as a result of the termination of an acquisition transaction 
we reported an income tax benefit of million  net of income tax expense attributable to noncontrolling interest  for the year ended december   compared to an income tax benefit of million 
table of contents for the increase was primarily due to the release of a portion of our valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset as a result of the arena acquisition 
net deferred tax liabilities recorded as a result of the arena acquisition in july reduced our existing net deferred tax asset position  allowing a corresponding reduction in the valuation allowance against the net deferred tax asset 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues 
total revenues decreased to million for the year ended december  from  million in this decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in oil and natural gas sales and a million decrease in midstream and marketing revenues 
year ended december  change change in thousands revenues oil and natural gas drilling and services midstream and marketing other total revenues total oil and natural gas revenues decreased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million in  primarily as a result of the decrease in oil and natural gas prices received for our production 
the average price received  excluding the impact of derivative contracts  for our oil and natural gas production decreased in to a combined equivalent price of per boe or per mcfe compared to per boe or per mcfe in the average price we received for our oil and natural gas production was negatively impacted by the decline in oil and natural gas prices experienced by the oil and natural gas industry during total natural gas production increased to bcf in compared to bcf in  while oil production increased to  mbbls in from  mbbls in drilling and services revenues decreased to million in compared to million in the decline in revenues was due to a decrease in rigs operating for and services performed for third parties and the decline in the average daily rate received per rig working for third parties 
the average daily rate we received per rig working for third parties declined to an average of  per rig per working day during from an average of  per rig per working day during midstream and marketing revenues decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million in the decrease was attributable to the decrease in prices for natural gas that we sold on behalf of third parties in compared to other revenues increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the increase was primarily due to higher co volumes sold to third parties during than 
table of contents operating costs and expenses 
total operating costs and expenses decreased to  million during  compared to  million in  primarily as a result of decreases in our midstream and marketing expenses  depreciation and depletion and the full cost ceiling impairment 
year ended december  change change in thousands operating costs and expenses production production taxes drilling and services midstream and marketing depreciation and depletion oil and natural gas depreciation and amortization other impairment general and administrative gain on derivative instruments loss gain on sale of assets total operating costs and expenses production expenses increased slightly to million for the year ended december   compared to million in  primarily due to the slight increase in production from our drilling activity in the permian basin and west texas 
production taxes decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million in  as a result of severance tax refunds totaling approximately million in and the decreased prices received for production 
as a result  production taxes on a unit of production basis decreased from per boe or per mcfe for to per boe or per mcfe for drilling and services expenses increased million  or  to million in compared to million in the increase was primarily due to less rig activity conducted on our properties and lower profit margins in  which resulted in a lower amount of costs associated with the drilling business being allocated to the full cost pool and an increased amount of such costs being expensed 
midstream and marketing expenses decreased million  or  to million in compared to million in  due primarily to lower prices paid for natural gas that we sold on behalf of third parties during than depreciation and depletion for our oil and natural gas properties decreased to million during from million in our average depreciation and depletion decreased to per boe or per mcfe from per boe or per mcfe in as a result of the cumulative full cost ceiling impairment  which reduced the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties 
the effect of the decrease in depreciation and depletion per unit was slightly offset by the increase in production for the year ended december  compared to depreciation and amortization for our other assets consists primarily of depreciation of our drilling rigs  midstream gathering and compression facilities and other equipment 
the million decrease in depreciation and amortization for our other assets was attributable primarily to the change in asset lives of certain of our drilling  oil field service  midstream and other assets to align with industry average lives for similar assets 
we calculate depreciation of property and equipment using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which range from to years 

table of contents during  we recorded a cumulative non cash impairment charge of  million on our properties as total capitalized costs of our oil and natural gas properties exceeded our full cost ceiling limitation at both march  and december  additional impairment expenses of million and million in were related to the decline in market value of our spare parts inventory and buildings that we determined will not have use or value in the future  respectively 
at december   we recorded a non cash full cost ceiling limitation impairment charge of  million on our properties 
additional impairment expenses in related to the impairment of our investment in and notes receivable due from larclay 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in the decrease was attributable  in part  to lower administrative costs due to the decrease in the number of people we employed for the year 
as of december   we had corporate employees compared to at december  also contributing to the decrease were lower professional services and office costs as a result of focused cost control efforts 
general and administrative expenses included non cash stock compensation expense  net of amounts capitalized  of million for the year ended december  compared to million in corporate salaries and wages were partially offset by capitalized general and administrative expenses of million  which included million of capitalized stock compensation  for and million for in accordance with the full cost method of accounting  we capitalize  into the full cost pool  internal costs that can be directly identified with our acquisition  exploration and development activities and do not include any costs related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
there was no stock compensation capitalized in due to the decline in average oil and natural gas prices during  we recorded a net gain of million million realized gain and million unrealized loss on our derivatives contracts for compared to a million net gain million realized loss and million unrealized gain in the realized gain of million for the year ended december  was primarily due to a decline in natural gas prices at the time of settlement compared to the contract price 
the unrealized loss recorded in was attributable to an increase in average natural gas prices at december  compared to december  or the contract date for contracts entered into during the loss on sale of assets for the year ended december  was primarily due to the million loss on the sale of our gathering and compression assets located in the pi on field 
for the year ended december   the gain on sale of assets was attributable to the approximately million gain on the sale of our assets located in the piceance basin of colorado 
other income expense 
total other expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million in the increase is reflected in the table below 
year ended december  change change in thousands other income expense interest income interest expense income from equity investments other income  net total other expense loss before income taxes income tax benefit net loss 
table of contents interest income decreased to million in from million in this decrease was generally due to lower excess cash levels during compared to interest expense increased to million in  from million  net of million of capitalized interest  in the increase in interest expense for was the result of higher average debt balances outstanding during compared to during the year ended december   we reported income from equity investments of million compared to million in the slight decline in income from equity investments was due to the consolidation of grlp beginning october  and lariat s assignment of its equity interest in larclay to cwei on april  other income  net increased to million in from million in the increase was generally due to million of a million break up fee received in as a result of the termination of an acquisition transaction 
approximately million of the break up fee was recorded in general and administrative expenses to offset costs we incurred during the acquisition process 
we reported an income tax benefit of million for the year ended december  compared to an income tax benefit of million in the income tax benefit represented an effective income tax rate of compared to an effective income tax rate of in the lower effective income tax rate associated with the net loss attributable to us before income taxes of  million was predominantly due to a valuation allowance on the net deferred tax asset 
the valuation allowance serves to reduce the tax benefits recognized from the net deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized based on the weight of all available evidence 
the tax benefit of million  net of the valuation allowance  for the year ended december  was due to various federal and state return to accrual adjustments 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash flow generated from operations  borrowings under our senior credit facility  the issuance of equity and debt securities  and the monetization of non core assets 
as described in item business recent developments  we could also realize proceeds from the proposed royalty trust offering 
our primary uses of capital are expenditures related to our oil and natural gas properties and other fixed assets  the acquisition of oil and natural gas properties  the repayment of amounts outstanding on our senior credit facility  the payment of dividends on our outstanding convertible perpetual preferred stock and interest payments on our outstanding debt 
we maintain access to funds that may be needed to meet capital funding requirements through our senior credit facility 
working capital our working capital balance fluctuates as a result of the timing and amount of borrowings or repayments under our credit arrangements and changes in the fair value of our outstanding commodity derivative instruments 
absent any significant effects from our commodity derivative instruments  we typically have a working capital deficit or a relatively small amount of positive working capital because our capital spending generally has exceeded our cash flows from operations and we generally use excess cash to pay down borrowings outstanding under our credit arrangements 
at december   we had a working capital deficit of million compared to a surplus of million at december  current assets decreased million at december   compared to current assets at december   primarily due to a million decrease in our current derivative contract assets resulting from the settlement of commodity derivative contracts during current liabilities increased million due  in part  to a million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses due to 
table of contents increased drilling activity 
our current derivative contract liabilities increased million due to increased liability positions on our oil price swaps and our natural gas basis swaps 
additionally  we recorded a provision of million for the estimated contract loss related to construction of the century plant 
the contract loss provision was net of accumulated costs on the contract and included in current liabilities 
cash flows our cash flows for the years ended december   and are presented in the following table and discussed below year ended december  in thousands cash flows cash flows provided by operating activities cash flows used in investing activities cash flows provided by financing activities net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents cash flows from operating activities our operating cash flow is mainly influenced by the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production  the quantity of oil and natural gas we produce  the demand for our drilling rigs and oil field services and the rates we are able to charge for these services  and the margins we obtain from our natural gas and co gathering and treating contracts 
net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities in compared to was primarily due to a increase in the combined average prices we received for our oil and natural gas production  and increased oil production resulting from the properties acquired from forest and arena and a focus on increased oil drilling in net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities from to is primarily due to our million decrease in revenues as a result of the decrease in prices received on our production during these decreases were partially offset by increases in realized gains on our commodity derivative contracts settled during cash flows from investing activities we dedicate and expect to continue to dedicate a substantial portion of our capital expenditure program toward the development  production and acquisition of oil and natural gas reserves 
these capital expenditures are necessary to offset inherent declines in production and proven reserves  which is typical in the capital intensive oil and natural gas industry 
cash flows used in investing activities decreased to million in the year ended december  from  million in primarily due to the use of equity to fund the majority of the arena acquisition in july rather than cash  which was used to purchase the properties acquired from forest in this was partially offset by increased capital expenditures during cash flows used in investing activities decreased to  million during from  million in due to the reduction in our capital expenditure program in capital expenditures  excluding 
table of contents acquisitions  decreased  million to million for the year ended december  compared to  million for the same period in primarily due to our decreased drilling activities 
the decrease in cash outflows for capital expenditures was partially offset by the forest acquisition which resulted in million of cash outflows in cash outflows from capital expenditures in were partially offset by approximately million in combined net proceeds from the sale of our gathering and compression assets located in the pi on field and our deep drilling rights in east texas 
cash outflows from capital expenditures in were partially offset by approximately million in proceeds from the sale of our assets located in the piceance basin of colorado 
capital expenditures 
our capital expenditures  on an accrual basis  by segment are summarized below year ended december  in thousands capital expenditures exploration and production drilling and oil field services midstream gas services other capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions acquisitions total acquisition expenditures include only the cash portion of the arena acquisition 
cash flows from financing activities our financing activities provided million in cash for the year ended december  compared to million in cash provided by financing activities during the year ended december  was primarily comprised of million of net borrowings  representing borrowings under our senior credit facility reduced by payments on our debt and million of net proceeds from the issuance of  shares of our convertible perpetual preferred stock  offset slightly by the payment of dividends on our convertible perpetual preferred stock and our convertible perpetual preferred stock and debt issuance costs 
cash provided by financing activities during the year ended december  was generated primarily by the private placements of an aggregate of  shares of our convertible perpetual preferred stock and the registered underwritten offering of  shares common stock that provided combined proceeds of approximately million  the majority of which were used to pay down amounts outstanding under the senior credit facility 
our financing activities provided million in cash for the year ended december  compared to  million for the year ended december  proceeds from borrowings were  million for the year ended december  compared to  million for  as a result of lower borrowings during under our senior credit facility 
we repaid borrowings of approximately  million during  leaving net borrowings of approximately million for the year 
during  we completed registered underwritten offerings of an aggregate of  shares of our common stock for net proceeds of approximately million 
also in  we completed private placements of an aggregate of  shares of our convertible perpetual preferred stock for net proceeds of approximately million 
indebtedness senior credit facility 
the amount we may borrow under our senior credit facility is limited to a borrowing base  which is currently million  and is subject to periodic redeterminations 
the borrowing base is 
table of contents determined based upon the discounted present value of future cash flows attributable to our proved reserves 
because the value of our proved reserves is a key factor in determining the amount of the borrowing base  changing commodity prices and our success in developing reserves may affect the borrowing base 
outstanding letters of credit affect the availability under the senior credit facility on a dollar for dollar basis 
the senior credit facility contains various covenants that limit the ability of us and certain of our subsidiaries to grant certain liens  make certain loans and investments  make distributions  redeem stock  redeem or prepay debt  merge or consolidate with or into a third party  or engage in certain asset dispositions  including a sale of all or substantially all of our assets 
additionally  the senior credit facility limits the ability of us and certain of our subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness with certain exceptions 
the senior credit facility also contains financial covenants  including maintaining agreed levels for the i ratio of total funded debt to ebitdax as defined in the senior credit facility  which may not exceed at each quarter end calculated using the last four completed fiscal quarters and ii ratio of current assets to current liabilities  which must be at least at each quarter end 
in the current ratio calculation as defined in the senior credit facility any amounts available to be drawn under the senior credit facility are included in current assets  and unrealized assets and liabilities resulting from mark to market adjustments on the company s derivative contracts are disregarded 
in april  we amended and restated our billion senior credit facility  extending the maturity date to april  from november and affirming the borrowing base at million 
the senior credit facility received commitments from participating lender institutions  three of which were new to the bank group 
the largest commitment held by any individual lender is 
in conjunction with the april amendment and restatement  a we and the lenders agreed to eliminate the covenant that had required us to maintain the ratio of ebitdax to interest expense plus current maturities of long term debt at specified levels and b our ability to make investments was increased from the previous terms 
in october  the senior credit facility was further amended and  effective with this amendment  the ratio of our secured indebtedness to ebitdax may not exceed at each quarter end 
on february   our senior credit facility was amended to  among other things  a exclude from the calculation of consolidated net income the net income or loss of a royalty trust  except to the extent of cash distributions received by us  b establish that an investment in a royalty trust and dispositions to  and of interests in  royalty trusts are permitted  c clarify that a royalty trust is not a subsidiary  d allow us to net against our calculation of consolidated funded indebtedness cash balances exceeding million in the event no loans are outstanding under the senior credit facility at that time  and e establish that  for any fiscal quarter prior to march   if our senior secured leverage ratio is less than then our consolidated leverage ratio is negated 
terms capitalized in the preceding sentence have the meaning given to them in the senior credit facility  as amended 
we remain in compliance with all debt covenants and the next redetermination of the borrowing base is scheduled to occur in the second quarter of long term debt 
long term obligations under outstanding debt agreements consist of the following at december  in thousands senior credit facility other notes payable senior floating rate notes due senior notes due senior notes due  net of  discount senior notes due senior notes due  net of  discount total debt 
table of contents the indentures governing the senior notes referred to above contain limitations on the incurrence of indebtedness  payment of dividends  investments  asset sales  certain asset purchases  transactions with related parties and consolidations or mergers 
for more information about the senior credit facility  the senior notes and our other long term debt obligations  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
outlook for  we have budgeted billion for capital expenditures 
the majority of our capital expenditures are discretionary and could be curtailed if our cash flows decline from expected levels or we are unable to obtain capital on attractive terms 
we may increase or decrease planned capital expenditures depending on oil and natural gas prices  asset sales and the availability of capital through the issuance of additional equity or long term debt 
our revenue  profitability and future growth are substantially dependent upon the prevailing and future prices for oil and natural gas  each of which depend on numerous factors beyond our control such as economic conditions  regulatory developments and competition from other energy sources 
the energy markets and oil and natural gas prices historically have been volatile and may be subject to significant fluctuations in the future 
our derivative arrangements serve to mitigate a portion of the effect of this price volatility on our cash flows  and while derivative contracts for the majority of expected and oil production are in place  fixed price swap contracts are in place for only a portion of expected and natural gas production and oil production and no fixed price swap contracts are in place for our natural gas production beyond or oil production beyond see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information regarding our derivative contracts 
in addition  we have and will continue to need to incur capital expenditures in order to achieve production targets contained in certain gathering and treating arrangements 
we are dependent on the availability of borrowings under our senior credit facility  along with cash flows from operating activities and proceeds from planned asset sales  to fund those capital expenditures 
based on anticipated oil and natural gas prices  availability under our senior credit facility  potential access to the capital markets and anticipated proceeds from the sales or other strategic monetizations of assets  we expect to be able to fund our planned capital expenditures budget  debt service requirements and working capital needs for the next months 
however  a substantial or extended decline in oil or natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations  cash flows and quantities of oil and natural gas reserves that may be economically produced  which could adversely impact our ability to comply with the financial covenants under our senior credit facility  which in turn would limit further borrowings to fund capital expenditures 
we may choose to refinance borrowings outstanding under the facility by issuing long term debt or equity in the public or private markets  or both 
we have the ability to reduce our capital expenditures budget if cash flows are not available 
as of december   our cash and cash equivalents were million and we had approximately billion in total debt outstanding with million outstanding under our senior credit facility 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of the covenants under all of our senior notes and our senior credit facility 
as of february   our cash and cash equivalents were approximately million  the balance outstanding under our senior credit facility was million and we had million outstanding in letters of credit

drilling contracts with third party drilling rig operators at specified day or footage rates 
all of our drilling rig contracts contain operator performance conditions that allow for pricing adjustments or early termination for operator nonperformance 
interest associated with borrowings under our senior credit facility have been excluded from the above table due to variability of both the amount borrowed and the applicable interest rate 
the principal amount outstanding under the senior credit facility at december  was million and has been included in the table 
amounts borrowed under the senior credit facility are due in and bore interest at a rate of as of december  we maintain deposits in bank trust and escrow accounts as required by boemr  surety bond underwriters  purchase agreements or other settlement agreements to satisfy our eventual responsibility to plug and abandon wells and remove structures when certain offshore fields are no longer in use 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make assumptions and prepare estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable  however  actual results may differ 
see note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for a discussion of our significant accounting policies 
proved reserves 
approximately of our reserves are estimated on an annual basis by independent petroleum engineers 
estimates of proved reserves are based on the quantities of oil and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate  with reasonable certainty  to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
however  there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future revenues  rates of production and timing of development expenditures  including many factors beyond our control 
estimating reserves is very complex and relies on assumptions and subjective interpretations of available geologic  geophysical  engineering 
table of contents and production data  and the accuracy of reserve estimates is a function of the quality and quantity of available data  engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
in addition  as a result of volatility and changing market conditions  commodity prices and future development costs will change from period to period  causing estimates of proved reserves to change  as well as causing estimates of future net revenues to change 
for the years ended december   and  we revised our proved reserves from prior years reports by approximately mmboe or  bcfe  mmboe or  bcfe and mmboe or bcfe  respectively  due to market prices during or at the end of the applicable period or production performance indicating more or less reserves in place or larger or smaller reservoir size than initially estimated or additional proved reserve bookings within the original field boundaries 
estimates of proved reserves are key components of our most significant financial estimates involving our rate for recording depreciation  depletion and amortization and our full cost ceiling limitation 
these revisions may be material and could materially affect our future depreciation and depletion expenses 
method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties 
the accounting for our business is subject to special accounting rules that are unique to the oil and natural gas industry 
there are two allowable methods of accounting for oil and natural gas business activities the successful efforts method and the full cost method 
we follow the full cost method of accounting 
all direct costs and certain indirect costs associated with the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties are capitalized 
exploration and development costs include dry well costs  geological and geophysical costs  direct overhead related to exploration and development activities and other costs incurred for the purpose of finding oil and natural gas reserves 
amortization of oil and natural gas properties is provided using the unit of production method based on estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves 
sales and abandonments of oil and natural gas properties being amortized are accounted for as adjustments to the full cost pool  with no gain or loss recognized  unless the adjustments would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved oil and natural gas reserves 
a significant alteration would not ordinarily be expected to occur upon the sale of reserves involving less than of the reserve quantities of a cost center 
under the successful efforts method  geological and geophysical costs and costs of carrying and retaining undeveloped properties are charged to expense as incurred 
costs of drilling exploratory wells that do not result in proved reserves are charged to expense 
depreciation  depletion and impairment of oil and natural gas properties are generally calculated on a well by well  lease or field basis versus the aggregated full cost pool basis 
additionally  gain or loss is generally recognized on all sales of oil and natural gas properties under the successful efforts method 
as a result  our financial statements will differ from companies that apply the successful efforts method since we will generally reflect a higher level of capitalized costs as well as a higher oil and natural gas depreciation  depletion and amortization rate  and we will not have exploration expenses that successful efforts companies frequently have 
in accordance with full cost accounting rules  capitalized costs are subject to a limitation 
the capitalized cost of oil and natural gas properties  net of accumulated depreciation  depletion  and amortization  less related deferred income taxes  may not exceed an amount equal to the present value of future net revenues from proved oil and natural gas reserves  discounted at per annum  plus the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties  plus estimated salvage value  less related tax effects the ceiling limitation 
beginning with the december  calculation  we began calculating our full cost ceiling limitation using the month average oil and natural gas prices for the most recent months as of the balance sheet date and adjusted for basis or location differential  held constant over the life of the reserves 
prior to december   the full cost ceiling limitation calculation required companies to use oil and natural gas prices on the last day of the period 
if capitalized costs exceed the ceiling limitation  the excess must be charged to expense 
once incurred  a write down is not reversible at a later date 
during the year ended december   total capitalized costs of our oil and natural gas properties exceeded our ceiling limitation resulting in a non cash ceiling impairment of  million  million of which was incurred in the fourth quarter under the current sec rule and  million of which was incurred in the first quarter under the rules in effect at the time 
for the year ended december   total capitalized costs of our oil and natural gas properties exceeded our ceiling limitation 
table of contents resulting in a non cash ceiling impairment of  million calculated under the previous rules 
there were no full cost ceiling impairments recorded during unevaluated properties 
the balance of unevaluated properties consists of capital costs incurred for undeveloped acreage  wells and production facilities in progress and wells pending determination  together with capitalized interest costs for these projects 
these costs are initially excluded from our amortization base until the outcome of the project has been determined or  generally  until it is known whether proved reserves will or will not be assigned to the property 
we assess all items classified as unevaluated property on a quarterly basis for possible impairment or reduction in value 
we assess our properties on an individual basis or as a group if properties are individually insignificant 
our assessment includes consideration of the following factors  among others intent to drill  remaining lease term  geological and geophysical evaluations  drilling results and activity  the assignment of proved reserves  and the economic viability of development if proved reserves are assigned 
during any period in which these factors indicate an impairment  the cumulative drilling costs incurred to date for such property and all or a portion of the associated leasehold costs are transferred to the full cost pool and are then subject to amortization 
we estimate that substantially all of our costs classified as unproved as of the balance sheet date will be evaluated and transferred within a six year period from the date of acquisition  contingent on our capital expenditures and drilling program 
asset retirement obligations 
asset retirement obligations represent the estimate of fair value to plug  abandon and remediate our oil and natural gas properties at the end of their productive lives  in accordance with applicable state laws 
we estimate the fair value of an asset s retirement obligation in the period in which the liability is incurred  if a reasonable estimate can be made 
we employ a present value technique to estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation  which reflects certain assumptions  including an inflation rate  our credit adjusted  risk free interest rate  the estimated settlement date of the liability and the estimated current cost to settle the liability based on third party quotes and current actual costs 
changes in timing or to the original estimate of cash flows will result in changes to the carrying amount of the liability 
revenue recognition and natural gas balancing 
oil and natural gas revenues are recorded when title of sold oil and natural gas production passes to the customer  net of royalties  discounts and allowances  as applicable 
we account for oil and natural gas production imbalances using the sales method  whereby we recognize revenue on all oil and natural gas sold to our customers notwithstanding the fact that its ownership may be less than of the oil and natural gas sold 
liabilities are recorded for imbalances greater than our proportionate share of remaining estimated oil and natural gas reserves 
we recognize revenues and expenses generated from daywork and footage drilling contracts as the services are performed  since we do not bear the risk of completion of the well 
we may receive lump sum fees for the mobilization of equipment and personnel 
mobilization fees received and costs incurred to mobilize a rig from one market to another are recognized over the term of the related drilling contract 
the contract terms typically range from days to two years 
revenue from sales of co is recognized when the product is delivered to the customer 
property  plant and equipment  net 
other capitalized costs  including drilling equipment  natural gas gathering and treating equipment  transportation equipment and other property and equipment are carried at cost 
renewals and improvements are capitalized while repairs and maintenance are expensed 
depreciation of drilling equipment is recorded using the straight line method based on estimated useful lives 
depreciation of other property and equipment is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from to years 
realization of the carrying value of property and equipment is reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
assets are 
table of contents determined to be impaired if a forecast of undiscounted estimated future net operating cash flows directly related to the asset including disposal value if any  is less than the carrying amount of the asset 
if any asset is determined to be impaired  the loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
an estimate of fair value is based on the best information available  including prices for similar assets 
changes in such estimates could cause us to reduce the carrying value of property and equipment 
when property and equipment components are disposed of  the cost and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in operations 
income taxes 
deferred income taxes are recorded for temporary differences between financial statement and income tax basis 
temporary differences are differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities reported for financial statement purposes and their tax basis 
deferred tax assets are recognized for temporary differences that will be deductible in future years tax returns and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is deemed more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
deferred tax liabilities are recognized for temporary differences that will be taxable in future years tax returns 
as of december   we continue to have a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset 
our deferred tax position changed from a net deferred tax liability as of december  to a net deferred tax asset as of december  due to the recording of a full cost ceiling impairment of  million 
the valuation allowance serves to reduce the tax benefits recognized from the net deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized based on the weight of all available evidence 
net deferred tax liabilities recorded as a result of the arena acquisition reduced our existing net deferred tax asset position  allowing a corresponding reduction in the valuation allowance 
derivative financial instruments 
to manage risks related to increases in interest rates and changes in oil and natural gas prices  we enter into interest rate swaps and oil and natural gas futures contracts 
we recognize all of our derivative contracts as either assets or liabilities at fair value 
we determine fair value of our derivative contracts primarily based upon quotes obtained from the counterparties to the contracts 
the changes in the fair value ie  gains or losses of a derivative contract is included in earnings unless the derivative contract has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship  and further  on the type of hedging relationship 
none of our derivatives was designated as hedging instruments during  and goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of the consideration paid over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in the arena acquisition 
goodwill is not amortized  but rather tested annually for impairment 
we will evaluate the carrying value of goodwill as of july of each year and between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
we have not identified any such events as of december  that required an impairment test prior to our annual goodwill evaluation

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general the discussion in this section provides information about the financial instruments we use to manage commodity prices and interest rate volatility 
all contracts are settled in cash and do not require the actual delivery of a commodity at settlement 
commodity price risk 
our most significant market risk relates to the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production 
due to the historical volatility of these commodities  we periodically have entered into  and expect in the future to enter into  derivative arrangements for the purpose of reducing the variability of oil and natural gas prices we receive for our production 
from time to time  we enter into commodity pricing derivative contracts for a portion of our anticipated production volumes depending upon management s view of opportunities under the then prevailing current market conditions 
our senior credit agreement limits our ability to enter into derivative transactions to of expected production volumes from estimated proved reserves 
we do not intend to enter into derivative contracts that would exceed our expected production volumes for the period covered by the derivative arrangement 
future credit agreements could require a minimum level of commodity price hedging 
the use of derivative contracts involves the risk that the counterparties will be unable to meet their obligations under the contracts 
our derivative contracts are with multiple counterparties to minimize our exposure to any individual counterparty 
as of december   we had approved derivative counterparties  all of which are lenders under our senior credit facility 
we currently have derivative contracts outstanding with of these counterparties 
we use  and may continue to use  a variety of commodity based derivative contracts  including fixed price swaps and basis protection swaps 
our oil fixed price swap transactions are settled based upon the average daily prices for the calendar month of the contract period 
our natural gas fixed price swap transactions are settled based upon new york mercantile exchange prices  and our natural gas basis protection swap transactions are settled based upon the index price of natural gas at the waha hub  a west texas gas marketing and delivery center  and the houston ship channel 
settlement for oil derivative contracts occurs in the succeeding month and natural gas derivative contracts are settled in the production month 
we have not designated any of our derivative contracts as hedges for accounting purposes 
we record all derivative contracts on the balance sheet at fair value  which reflects changes in oil and natural gas prices 
we establish fair value of our derivative contracts by price quotations obtained from counterparties to the derivative contracts 
changes in fair values of our derivative contracts are recognized as unrealized gains and losses in current period earnings 
as a result  our current period earnings may be significantly affected by changes in the fair value of our commodity derivative contracts 
changes in fair value are principally measured based on period end prices compared to the contract price 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for a summary of our open oil and natural gas commodity derivative contracts 
the following table summarizes the cash settlements and valuation gains and losses on our commodity derivative contracts for the years ended december   and in thousands year ended december  oil and natural gas derivatives realized gain loss unrealized loss gain loss gain on commodity derivative contracts 
table of contents includes million of realized gains for the year ended december   related to settlements of commodity derivative contracts with contractual maturities after the quarterly period in which they were settled 
there were no commodity derivative contracts settled prior to the contractual maturity during or credit risk 
we minimize the volatility of our liquidity by entering into derivative contracts that enable us to mitigate a portion of our exposure to oil and natural gas prices and interest rate volatility 
we periodically review the credit quality of each counterparty to our derivative contracts and the level of overall financial exposure we have to each counterparty to limit our credit risk exposure with respect to these contracts 
additionally  we apply a credit default risk rating factor for our counterparties in determining the fair value of our derivative contracts 
the counterparties for all of our derivative transactions have an investment grade credit rating 
our ability to fund our capital expenditure budget is partially dependent upon the availability of funds under our senior credit facility 
in order to mitigate the credit risk associated with individual financial institutions committed to participate in our senior credit facility  our bank group currently consists of financial institutions with commitments ranging from to 
interest rate risk 
we are subject to interest rate risk on our long term fixed and variable interest rate borrowings 
fixed rate debt  where the interest rate is fixed over the life of the instrument  exposes us to i changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and ii the risk that we may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at a higher rate 
variable rate debt  where the interest rate fluctuates  exposes us to short term changes in market interest rates as our interest obligations on these instruments are periodically redetermined based on prevailing market interest rates  primarily libor and the federal funds rate 
in addition to commodity price derivative arrangements  we may enter into derivative transactions to fix the interest we pay on a portion of the money we borrow under our credit agreement 
we have entered into two million notional interest rate swap agreements to fix the variable interest rate on the senior floating rate notes through april  the first interest rate swap agreement fixes the rate on the senior floating rate notes at an annual rate of through april  the second interest rate swap agreement fixes the rate on the senior floating rate notes at an annual rate of for the period from april  to april  the two interest rate swaps effectively serve to fix the variable interest rate on our senior floating rate notes for the majority of the term of these notes 
these swaps have not been designated as hedges 
our interest rate swaps reduce our market risk on our senior floating rate notes 
we use sensitivity analyses to determine the impact that market risk exposures could have on our variable interest rate borrowings if not for our interest rate swaps 
based on the million outstanding balance of our senior floating rate notes at december   a one percent change in the applicable rates  with all other variables held constant  would have resulted in a change in our interest expense of approximately million for the year ended december  the following table summarizes the cash settlements and valuation gains and losses on our interest rate swaps for the years ended december   and in thousands year ended december  interest rate swaps realized loss gain unrealized loss gain loss on interest rate swaps
