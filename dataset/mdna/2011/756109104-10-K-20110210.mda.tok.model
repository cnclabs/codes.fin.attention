item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general realty income corporation  the monthly dividend company  is a maryland corporation organized to operate as an equity real estate investment trust  or reit 
our primary business objective is to generate dependable monthly cash distributions from a consistent and predictable level of funds from operations  or ffo  per share 
our monthly distributions are supported by the cash flow from our portfolio of properties leased to retail and other commercial enterprises 
we have in house acquisition  leasing  legal  credit research  real estate research  portfolio management and capital markets expertise 
over the past years  realty income and its predecessors have been acquiring and owning freestanding retail and other commercial properties that generate rental revenue under long term lease agreements primarily to years 
in addition  we seek to increase distributions to stockholders and ffo per share through both active portfolio management and the acquisition of additional properties 
at december   we owned a diversified portfolio of  properties  with an occupancy rate of  or  properties occupied and only properties available for lease  leased to different retail and other commercial enterprises doing business in separate industries  located in states  with over million square feet of leasable space  and with an average leasable space per property of approximately  square feet 
of the  properties in the portfolio   or  are single tenant properties  and the remaining are multi tenant  distribution and office properties 
at december   of the  single tenant properties   were leased with a weighted average remaining lease term excluding extension options of approximately years 
in addition  at december   our wholly owned taxable reit subsidiary  crest net lease  inc crest  had an inventory of three properties valued at million  which are classified as held for investment 
no crest properties are classified as held for sale at december  crest was created to buy and sell properties  primarily to individual investors who are involved in tax deferred exchanges under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code 
in addition to the three properties  crest also holds notes receivable of million at december  crest did not acquire any properties in liquidity and capital resources capital philosophy historically  we have met our long term capital needs by issuing common stock  preferred stock and long term unsecured notes and bonds 
over the long term  we believe that common stock should be the majority of our capital structure 
however  we may issue additional preferred stock or debt securities from time to time 
we may issue common stock when we believe that our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering to be invested on an accretive basis into additional properties 
in addition  we may issue common stock to permanently finance properties that were financed by our credit facility or debt securities 
however  we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital markets at times and at terms that are acceptable to us 

table of contents conservative capital structure we believe that our stockholders are best served by a conservative capital structure 
therefore  we seek to maintain a conservative debt level on our balance sheet and solid interest and fixed charge coverage ratios 
at december   our total outstanding borrowings were billion of senior unsecured notes  or approximately of our total market capitalization of billion 
there were no outstanding borrowings on our credit facility at december  we define our total market capitalization at december  as the sum of shares of our common stock outstanding of  multiplied by the last reported nyse sales price of per share on december   or billion  aggregate liquidation value par value of per share of the class d preferred stock of million  aggregate liquidation value par value of per share of the class e preferred stock of million  and outstanding notes of billion 
mortgage debt we have no mortgage debt on any of our properties 
million acquisition credit facility in december  we entered into a new million acquisition credit facility that replaced our previous million acquisition credit facility that was scheduled to expire in may the initial term of the new credit facility expires in march and includes two  one year extension options 
under the new credit facility  our investment grade credit ratings provide for financing at the london interbank offered rate  commonly referred to as libor  plus basis points with a facility commitment fee of basis points  for all in drawn pricing of basis points over libor 
the borrowing rate is not subject to a libor floor 
we also have other interest rate options available to us 
at december   we had a borrowing capacity of million available on our credit facility and no outstanding balance 
if there were outstanding borrowings  the effective borrowing rate would have been 
we expect to use our credit facility to acquire additional properties and for other corporate purposes 
any additional borrowings will increase our exposure to interest rate risk 
we have the right to request an increase in the borrowing capacity of the credit facility  up to million  to a total borrowing capacity of million 
any increase in the borrowing capacity is subject to approval by the lending banks participating in our credit facility 
cash reserves we are organized to operate as an equity reit that acquires and leases properties and distributes to stockholders  in the form of monthly cash distributions  a substantial portion of our net cash flow generated from leases on our properties 
we intend to retain an appropriate amount of cash as working capital 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand  cash provided from operating activities and borrowing capacity is sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future 
we intend  however  to use additional sources of capital to fund property acquisitions and to repay future borrowings under our credit facility 
acquisitions during during  we invested million in new properties with an initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 
these properties are located in states  contain over million leasable square feet  and are leased with an average lease term of years 
the new properties we acquired are net leased to commercial enterprises in the following industries apparel stores  automotive collision services  automotive service  crafts and novelties  consumer electronics  convenience stores  drug stores  grocery stores  health and fitness  office supplies  restaurants  sporting goods and wine and spirits 
there were no acquisitions by crest in 
table of contents the initial weighted average contractual lease rate is computed as estimated contractual net operating income in a net leased property that is equal to the aggregate base rent for the first year of each lease  divided by the estimated total cost of the properties 
since it is possible that a tenant could default on the payment of contractual rent  we cannot assure you that the actual return on the funds invested will remain at the percentages listed above 
included in the million invested during are the following acquisitions the acquisition and leaseback of approximately million of winery and vineyard properties under year  triple net lease agreements with diageo chateau estates wine company  guaranteed by diageo plc  or  together with its subsidiaries  diageo

impact of real estate and credit markets in the commercial real estate market  property prices generally continue to fluctuate 
likewise  the us credit markets have experienced significant price volatility  dislocations and liquidity disruptions  which sometimes impact our access to and cost of capital 
we continue to monitor the commercial real estate and us credit markets carefully and  if required  will make decisions to adjust our business strategy accordingly 
see our discussion of risk factors in this annual report 
increases in monthly distributions to common stockholders we have continued our year policy of paying distributions monthly 
monthly distributions per share increased in april by to  in july by to  in october by to and in january by to 
the increase in january was our rd consecutive quarterly increase and the th increase in the amount of our dividend since our listing on the new york stock exchange  or nyse  in in  we paid three monthly cash distributions per share in the amount of  three in the amount of  three in the amount of and three in the amount of  totaling 
in december  january and february  we declared distributions of per share  which were paid in january and will be paid in february and march  respectively 
the monthly distribution of per share represents an annualized distribution of per share  and an annualized distribution yield of approximately based on the last reported sale price of our common stock on the nyse of on december  although we expect to continue our policy of paying monthly distributions  we cannot guarantee that we will maintain our current level of distributions  that we will continue our pattern of increasing distributions per share  or what our actual distribution yield will be in any future period

credit agency ratings the borrowing rates under our credit facility are based upon our credit ratings 
we are currently assigned the following investment grade credit ratings on our senior unsecured notes fitch ratings has assigned a rating of bbb  moody s investors service has assigned a rating of baa and standard poor s ratings group has assigned a rating of bbb to our senior notes 
all of these ratings have stable outlooks 
based on our current ratings  the current facility interest rate is libor plus basis points with a facility commitment fee of basis points  for all in drawn pricing of basis points over libor 
the credit facility provides that the interest rate can range between i libor plus basis points if our credit facility is lower than bbb baa and ii libor plus basis points if our credit rating is a a or higher 
in addition  our credit facility provides for a facility commitment fee based on our credit ratings  which ranges from i basis points for a rating lower than bbb baa  and ii basis points for a credit rating of a a or higher 
we also issue senior debt securities from time to time and our credit ratings can impact the interest rates charged in those transactions 
if our credit ratings or ratings outlook change  our cost to obtain debt financing could increase or decrease 
the credit ratings assigned to us could change based upon  among other things  our results of operations and financial condition 
these ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies and we cannot assure you that our ratings will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future if  in its judgment  circumstances warrant

we have been in compliance with these covenants since each of the notes and bonds was issued 
the following is a summary of the key financial covenants for our senior unsecured notes  as defined and calculated per the terms of our notes 
these calculations  which are not based on gaap measurements  are presented to investors to show our ability to incur additional debt under the terms of our notes only and are not measures of our liquidity or performance

dividends on shares of class d preferred stock are paid monthly in arrears 
in  we issued million shares of class e cumulative redeemable preferred stock 
beginning december   shares of class e preferred stock become redeemable at our option for per share  plus any accrued and unpaid dividends 
dividends on shares of class e preferred stock are paid monthly in arrears 
we are current in our obligations to pay dividends on our class d and class e preferred stock 
no off balance sheet arrangements or unconsolidated investments we have no unconsolidated or off balance sheet investments in variable interest entities or off balance sheet financing  nor do we engage in trading activities involving energy or commodity contracts or other derivative instruments 
additionally  we have no joint ventures or mandatorily redeemable preferred stock 
as such  our financial position and results of operations are not affected by accounting regulations regarding the consolidation of off balance sheet entities and classification of financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
results of operations critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
our consolidated financial statements are the basis for our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
preparing our consolidated financial statements requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that we have made these estimates and assumptions in an appropriate manner and in a way that accurately reflects our financial condition 
we continually test and evaluate these estimates and assumptions using our historical knowledge of the business  as well as other factors  to ensure that they are reasonable for reporting purposes 
however  actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 
this summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of our accounting policies and procedures included in note to our consolidated financial statements 
in order to prepare our consolidated financial statements according to the rules and guidelines set forth by gaap  many subjective judgments must be made with regard to critical accounting policies 
one of these judgments is our estimate for useful lives in determining depreciation expense for our properties 
depreciation on a majority of our buildings and improvements is computed using the straight line method over an estimated useful life of years 
if we use a shorter or longer estimated useful life  it could have a material impact on our results of operations 
we believe that years is an appropriate estimate of useful life 
when acquiring a property for investment purposes  we allocate the fair value of real estate acquired to land and building and improvements  based in each case on their estimated fair values 
for properties acquired with in place operating leases  the fair value of real estate is allocated to land  building and improvements  and identified intangible assets and liabilities  based in each case on their estimated fair values 
intangible assets and liabilities consist of above market and below market leases  the value of in place leases and tenant relationships 
another significant judgment must be made as to if  and when  impairment losses should be taken on our properties when events or a change in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
a provision is made for impairment if estimated future operating cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges plus estimated disposition proceeds undiscounted are less than the current book value of the property 
key inputs that we estimate in this analysis include projected rental rates  capital expenditures  and property sales capitalization rates 
if a property is held for sale  it is carried at the lower of carrying cost or estimated fair value  less estimated cost to sell 
the carrying value of our real estate is the largest component of our consolidated balance sheet 
if events should occur that require us to reduce the carrying value of our real estate by recording provisions for impairment  it could have a material impact on our results of operations 

table of contents the following is a comparison of our results of operations for the years ended december   and rental revenue rental revenue was million for versus million for  an increase of million  or

at december   our portfolio of  properties was leased with properties available for lease as compared to at december  it has been our experience that approximately to of our property portfolio will be unleased at any given time  however  we cannot assure you that the number of properties available for lease will not exceed these levels 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization was million in versus million in and million in the increases in depreciation and amortization in and were primarily due to the acquisition of properties in  and  which was partially offset by property sales in those same years

table of contents interest expense interest expense was million in versus million in and million in the increase in interest expense from to was primarily due to an increase in borrowings attributable to the issuance of our million of senior unsecured notes in june and utilization of our credit facility in  which was partially offset by lower average interest rates 
the decrease in interest expense from to was primarily due to lower average outstanding balances and  to a lesser extent  lower interest rates 
we redeemed  in november  the million outstanding principal amount of our monthly income senior notes and  in january  the million outstanding principal amount of our notes  both of which contributed to the decrease in average outstanding balances and lower average interest rates on our debt in in december  as a result of entering into our million credit facility  we incurred million of credit facility origination costs that were classified in other assets on our consolidated balance sheet at december   and are being amortized over the term of the credit facility

general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased by million to million in as compared to million in general and administrative expenses were million in in  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue were as compared to in and in general and administrative expenses increased during primarily because of increases in employee costs  particularly in the acquisitions and research departments

table of contents property expenses property expenses are broken down into costs associated with non net leased multi tenant properties  unleased single tenant properties and general portfolio expenses 
expenses related to the multi tenant and unleased single tenant properties include  but are not limited to  property taxes  maintenance  insurance  utilities  property inspections  bad debt expense and legal fees 
general portfolio costs include  but are not limited to  insurance  legal  bad debt expense  property inspections and title search fees 
at december   properties were available for lease  as compared to at december  and at december  property expenses were million in  million in and million in the increase in property expenses in is primarily attributable to an increase in maintenance  utilities and property taxes associated with properties available for lease  partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense 
income taxes income taxes were million in as compared to  in and million in these amounts are for city and state income and franchise taxes paid by realty income 
income taxes for are lower primarily a result of a prior year review of our state tax filings  where we determined that it was appropriate to amend some prior year tax returns from which we realized a tax benefit of  in in addition  crest recorded state and federal income tax benefits of  in as compared to income tax benefits of  in and income tax expense of  in these amounts are included in income from discontinued operations  real estate acquired for resale by crest on our consolidated statements of income 
the crest tax benefit includes a benefit of  attributable to amendments of certain prior year state tax returns 
discontinued operations crest acquires properties with the intention of reselling them rather than holding them as investments and operating the properties 
consequently  we typically crest assets as held for sale at the date of acquisition and do not depreciate them 
as a result  the operations of crest s property assets are typically classified as income from discontinued operations  real estate acquired for resale by crest on our consolidated statements of income 
however  if we determine we have no plans to sell a property asset in the near term ie within the next months  and this property was previously classified as held for sale  the property is reclassified as real estate held for investment 
a property that is reclassified as held for investment is measured and recorded at the lower of i its carrying amount before the property was classified as held for sale  adjusted for any depreciation expense that would have been recognized had the property been continuously classified as held for investment  or ii the fair value at the date of the subsequent decision not to sell 
at december   we determined that three property assets  acquired by crest in  no longer met the held for sale criteria because we decided to lease rather than sell these properties in the near term

table of contents funds from operations available to common stockholders ffo ffo for increased by million  or  to million  as compared to million in and million in the following is a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders which we believe is the most comparable gaap measure to ffo 
also presented is information regarding distributions paid to common stockholders and the weighted average number of common shares used for the basic and diluted computation per share dollars in thousands  except per share amounts net income available to common stockholders depreciation and amortization continuing operations discontinued operations depreciation of furniture  fixtures and equipment gain on sales of land and investment properties continuing operations discontinued operations ffo available to common stockholders ffo per common share basic diluted distributions paid to common stockholders ffo in excess of distributions paid to common stockholders weighted average number of common shares used for computation per share basic diluted we define ffo  a non gaap measure  consistent with the national association of real estate investment trust s definition  as net income available to common stockholders  plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets  reduced by gains on sales of investment properties and extraordinary items 
we consider ffo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of a reit s operating performance as it is based on a net income analysis of property portfolio performance that adds back non cash items such as depreciation 
the historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight line depreciation of buildings and improvements  which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions  presentations of operating results for a reit  using historical accounting for depreciation  could be less informative 
the use of ffo is recommended by the reit industry as a supplemental performance measure 
in addition  ffo is used as a measure of our compliance with the financial covenants of our credit facility 
presentation of this information is intended to assist the reader in comparing the operating performance of different reits  although it should be noted that not all reits calculate ffo the same way  so comparisons with other reits may not be meaningful 
furthermore  ffo is not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance 
in addition  ffo should not be considered as an alternative to reviewing our cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity  of our ability to make cash distributions or of our ability to pay interest payments 

table of contents adjusted funds from operations available to common stockholders affo affo for increased by million  or  to million as compared to million in and million in we consider affo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our performance because it provides analysts and investors with an additional indicator of our ability to pay dividends 
most companies in our industry use a similar measurement  but they may use the term cad for cash available for distribution or fad for funds available for distribution 
affo further adjusts ffo by adding back non cash items that reduce net income in accordance with gaap  and deducting such items as capitalized expenditures and straight line rent revenue 
the following is a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders which we believe is the most comparable gaap measure to ffo and affo 
also presented is information regarding distributions paid to common stockholders and the weighted average number of common shares used for the basic and diluted computation per share dollars in thousands  except per share amounts net income available to common stockholders cumulative adjustments to calculate ffo ffo available to common stockholders amortization of share based compensation amortization of deferred note financing costs amortization of settlements on treasury lock agreements provisions for impairment capitalized leasing costs and commissions capitalized building improvements straight line rent revenue total affo available to common stockholders affo per common share basic diluted distributions paid to common stockholders affo in excess of distributions paid to common stockholders weighted average number of common shares used for computation per share basic diluted see reconciling items for ffo presented on the previous page 
amortization of deferred note financing costs includes the amortization of costs incurred and capitalized when our notes were issued in january  march  november  march  september  september  september and june these costs are being amortized over the lives of these notes 
no costs associated with our credit facility agreements or annual fees paid to credit rating agencies have been included 
the settlement on the treasury lock agreements resulted from an interest rate risk prevention strategy that we used in and  which correlated to pending issuances of senior note securities 
we have not employed this strategy since a negative amount indicates that our straight line rent revenue was greater than our actual cash rent collected

table of contents impact of inflation tenant leases generally provide for limited increases in rent as a result of increases in the tenants sales volumes  increases in the consumer price index typically subject to ceilings  and or fixed increases 
we expect that inflation will cause these lease provisions to result in rent increases over time 
during times when inflation is greater than increases in rent  as provided for in the leases  rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation 
of our  properties in our portfolio  approximately or  are leased to tenants under net leases where the tenant is responsible for property expenses 
net leases tend to reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation 
inflation and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our tenants if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue 
impact of recent accounting pronouncements for information on the impact of recent accounting pronouncements on our business  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of our credit facility and long term notes and bonds used to maintain liquidity and expand our real estate investment portfolio and operations 
our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flow and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives we issue long term notes and bonds  primarily at fixed rates 
we were not a party to any derivative financial instruments at december  we do not enter into any derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes 
the following table presents by year of expected maturity  the principal amounts  average interest rates and estimated fair values of our fixed and variable debt as of december  this information is presented to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes dollars in millions expected maturity data year of maturity fixed rate debt average interest rate on fixed rate debt variable rate debt average interest rate on variable rate debt thereafter totals fair value million matures in march the credit facility expires in march million matures in november million matures in september  million matures in september  million matures in august  million matures in january and million matures in march we base the estimated fair value of the fixed rate debt at december  on the indicative market prices and recent trading activity of our notes payable 
the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december  it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date 
as a result  our ultimate realized gain or loss  with respect to interest rate fluctuations  would depend on the exposures that arise during the period  our hedging strategies at the time  and interest rates 
all of our outstanding notes and bonds have fixed interest rates 
interest on our credit facility balance is variable 
at december   our credit facility balance was zero  however  we intend to borrow funds on our credit facility in the future 
based on a hypothetical credit facility borrowing of million  a change in interest rates would change our interest costs by  per year
