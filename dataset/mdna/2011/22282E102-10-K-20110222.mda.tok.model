item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we are focusing our efforts on operating our existing business and pursuing strategic growth opportunities through development and acquisition with the goal of maximizing long term stockholder return 
we anticipate that a part of our future growth will come from investing in or acquiring additional energy from waste  waste disposal and renewable energy production businesses 
we are pursuing additional growth opportunities particularly in locations where the market demand  regulatory environment or other factors encourage technologies such as energy from waste to reduce dependence on landfilling for waste disposal and fossil fuels for energy production in order to reduce ghg emissions 
we are focusing on the united kingdom  with additional opportunities in ireland  canada and the united states 
our growth opportunities include new energy from waste and other renewable energy projects  existing project expansions  contract extensions  acquisitions  and businesses ancillary to our existing business  such as additional waste transfer  transportation  processing and disposal businesses 
we also intend to maintain a focus on research and development of technologies that we believe will enhance our competitive position  and offer new technical solutions to waste and energy problems that augment and complement our business 
we have a growth pipeline and continue to pursue several billion dollars worth of energy from waste development opportunities 
however  much remains to be done and there is substantial uncertainty relating to the bidding and permitting process for each 
table of contents project opportunity 
if  and when  these development efforts are successful  we plan to invest in these projects to achieve an attractive return on capital particularly when leveraged with project debt which we intend to utilize for all of our development projects 
americas segment energy from waste projects energy from waste projects have two essential purposes to provide waste disposal services  typically to municipal clients who sponsor the projects  and to use that waste as a fuel source to generate renewable energy 
the electricity or steam generated by the projects is generally sold to local utilities or industrial customers  and most of the resulting revenues reduce the overall cost of waste disposal services to the municipal clients 
these projects are capable of providing waste disposal services and generating electricity or steam  if properly operated and maintained  for several decades 
generally  we provide these waste disposal services and sell the electricity and steam generated under contracts  which expire on various dates between and many of our service contracts may be renewed for varying periods of time  at the option of the municipal client 
our energy from waste projects generate revenue from three main sources fees charged for operating projects or processing waste received  the sale of electricity and or steam  and the sale of ferrous and non ferrous metals that are recycled as part of the energy from waste process 
we may also generate additional revenue from the construction or expansion of a facility when a municipal client owns the facility 
our customers for waste disposal or facility operations are principally municipal entities  though we also market disposal capacity at certain facilities to commercial waste haulers 
our facilities sell energy primarily to utilities at contracted rates or  in situations where a contract is not in place  at prevailing market rates in regional markets primarily pjm  nepool and nyiso in the northeastern us we also operate  and in some cases have ownership interests in  transfer stations and landfills which generate revenue from waste and ash disposal fees or operating fees 
in addition  we own  and in some cases operate  other renewable energy projects in the americas segment which generate electricity from wood waste biomass  landfill gas  and hydroelectric resources 
the electricity from these other renewable energy projects is sold to utilities under contracts or into the regional power pool at short term rates 
for these projects  we receive revenue from sales of energy  capacity and or cash from equity distributions and additional value from the sale of renewable energy credits 
contract structures we currently operate energy from waste projects in states and one canadian province 
most of our energy from waste projects were developed and structured contractually as part of competitive procurement processes conducted by municipal entities 
as a result  many of these projects have common features 
however  each service agreement is different  reflecting the specific needs and concerns of a client community  applicable regulatory requirements and or other factors 
our efw projects can generally be divided into three categories  based on the applicable contract structure at a project tip fee projects  service fee projects that we own  and service fee projects that we do not own but operate on behalf of a municipal owner 
at tip fee projects  we receive a per ton fee for processing waste  and we typically retain all of the revenue generated from energy and recycled metal sales 
we generally own or lease the tip fee facilities 
at service fee projects  we typically charge a fixed fee for operating the facility  and the facility capacity is dedicated either primarily or exclusively to the host community client  which also retains the majority of any revenue generated from energy and recycled metal sales 
as a result of these distinctions  the revenue generated at tip fee projects tends to be more dependent on operating performance  as well as market conditions  than the revenue at service fee projects 
our projects were generally financed at construction with project debt in the form of tax exempt municipal bonds issued by a sponsoring municipality  which generally mature at the same time the initial term of our service contract expires and are repaid over time based on set amortization schedules 
at tip fee facilities  our project subsidiary is responsible for meeting any debt service or lease payment obligations out of the revenue generated by the facility 
at service fee projects that we own and where project debt is in place  a portion of our monthly fee from the municipal client is dedicated  dollar for dollar  to project debt service 
we are not responsible for debt service for projects that we neither own nor lease 
when the service contract expires and the debt is paid off  the project owner either covanta or the municipal entity will determine the form of any new contractual arrangements 

table of contents the following summarizes the typical contractual and economic characteristics of the three project structures in the americas segment service fee service fee tip fee owned operated number of facilities client s host community and municipal and commercial waste customers host community  with limited merchant capacity in some cases dedicated to host community exclusively waste or service revenue per ton tipping fee fixed fee  with performance incentives and inflation escalation fixed fee  with performance incentives and inflation escalation energy revenue covanta retains share with client typically retain share with client typically retain metals revenue covanta retains share with client share with client operating costs covanta responsible for all operating costs pass through certain costs to municipal client eg ash disposal pass through certain costs to municipal client eg ash disposal project debt service covanta project subsidiary responsible paid explicitly as part of service fee client responsible for debt service after service contract expiration n a covanta owns the facility  clients have certain rights set forth in contracts client owns the facility  extend with covanta or tender for new contract contracted and merchant capacity our service and waste disposal agreements  as well as our energy contracts  expire at various times 
the extent to which any such expiration will affect us will depend upon a variety of factors  including whether we own the project  market conditions then prevailing  and whether the municipal client exercises options it may have to extend the contract term 
as our contracts expire  we will become subject to greater market risk in maintaining and enhancing our revenues 
as service agreements at municipally owned facilities expire  we intend to seek to enter into renewal or replacement contracts to operate such facilities 
we will also seek to bid competitively in the market for additional contracts to operate other facilities as similar contracts of other vendors expire 
as our service and waste disposal agreements at facilities we own or lease begin to expire  we intend to seek replacement or additional contracts  and because project debt on these facilities will be paid off at such time  we expect to be able to offer rates that will attract sufficient quantities of waste while providing acceptable revenues to us 
at facilities we own  the expiration of existing energy contracts will require us to sell our output either into the local electricity grid at prevailing rates or pursuant to new contracts 
to date  we have been generally successful in extending our existing contracts to operate energy from waste facilities owned by municipal clients where market conditions and other factors make it attractive for both us and our municipal clients to do so 
see discussion under item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview growth and development for additional information 
the extent to which additional extensions will be attractive to us and to our municipal clients who own their projects will depend upon the market and other factors noted above 
however  we do not believe that either our success or lack of success in entering into additional negotiated extensions to operate such facilities will have a material impact on our overall cash flow and profitability in next several years 
see item a 
risk factors our results of operations may be adversely affected by market conditions existing at the time our contracts expire 
as we seek to enter into extended or new contracts  we expect that medium and long term contracts for waste supply  at least for a substantial portion of facility capacity  will be available on acceptable terms in the marketplace 
we also expect that medium and long term contracts for sales of energy will be less available than in the past 
as a result  following the expiration of these long term contracts  we expect to have on a relative basis more exposure to market risk  and therefore revenue fluctuations  in energy markets than in waste markets 
we may enter into contractual arrangements that will mitigate our exposure to revenue fluctuations in energy markets through a variety of hedging techniques 
in conjunction with our energy from waste business  we also own and or operate transfer stations  two ashfills and two landfills in the northeast united states  which we utilize to supplement and manage more efficiently the fuel and ash disposal requirements at our energy from waste operations 
we provide waste procurement services to our waste disposal and transfer facilities which have available capacity to receive waste 
with these services  we seek to maximize our revenue and ensure that our energy from waste facilities are being utilized most efficiently  taking into account maintenance schedules and operating restrictions that may exist from time to time at each facility 
we also provide management and marketing of ferrous and non ferrous metals recovered from energy from waste operations  as well as services related to non hazardous special waste destruction and ash residue management for our energy from waste projects 
biomass projects we own and operate seven wood fired generation facilities and have a interest in a partnership which owns another wood fired generation facility 
six of these facilities are located in california  and two are located in maine 
the combined gross energy output from these facilities is mw 
we generate income from our biomass facilities from sales of electricity  capacity  and where 
table of contents available  additional value from the sale of renewable energy credits 
these facilities sell their energy output into local power pools or to local utilities at rates that float with the market 
at all of these projects  we purchase fuel pursuant to short term contracts or other arrangements  in each case at prevailing market rates which exposes us to fuel price risk 
the price of fuel varies depending upon the time of year  local supply  and price of energy 
as such  and unlike our energy from waste businesses  we earn income at our biomass facilities based on the margin between our cost of fuel and our revenue from selling the related output 
during and  this margin was negative at certain of our biomass facilities 
we suspended operations periodically at those locations until we entered into favorable long term agreements for the energy output 
we will consider taking similar action in the future if market conditions warrant such action 
in and  revenue from our biomass projects represented approximately and  respectively  of our americas segment revenue 
other renewable energy projects we also engage in developing  owning and or operating renewable energy production facilities utilizing a variety of energy sources such as water hydroelectric and landfill gas 
we derive our revenues from these facilities primarily from the sale of energy  capacity  and where available  renewable energy credits 
we generally operate and maintain these projects for our own account or we do so on a cost plus basis rather than a fixed fee basis 
hydroelectric we own a equity interest in two small run of river hydroelectric facilities located in the state of washington which sell energy and capacity to puget sound energy under long term energy contracts 
we have a nominal equity investment in two hydroelectric facilities in costa rica 
landfill gas we own and operate two landfill gas projects located in california and one in massachusetts which produce electricity by combusting methane gas produced in landfills 
these projects sell energy to various utilities 
in both and  revenue from our landfill gas projects was less than of our americas segment revenue 
upon the expiration of the remaining energy contracts  we expect that these projects will enter into new power off take arrangements
