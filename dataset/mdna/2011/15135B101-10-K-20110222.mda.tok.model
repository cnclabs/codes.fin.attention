the timing and outcome of any decision from the appellate court is unknown at this time 
in march  the patient protection and affordable care act and the accompanying health care and education affordability reconciliation act  or the acts  were enacted in the united states 
the acts contain provisions we expect will have a significant effect on our business in coming years including expanding medicaid eligibility beginning in to recipients with incomes below of the federal poverty level  retaining the chip program in its current form  and requiring state based exchanges similar to our experience in massachusetts in the future 
the acts allow states to receive the same level of rebates from pharmaceutical companies for their medicaid programs  whether or not the states participate in managed care

effective in  minimum health benefit cost ratios will be mandated for commercial  fully insured major medical health plans in the individual market  like our celtic subsidiary 
the minimum health benefit cost ratio for these commercial plans will be set at of premium revenue  adjusted for certain taxes  fees  assessments  risk premium and a credibility factor based upon both the number of covered life years and an average plan cost sharing adjustment calculated for each state 
if the actual health benefit cost ratios do not meet the minimum calculated for any state  rebates will be paid to those policyholders 
due to its complexity and lack of comprehensive interpretive guidance and implementing regulations  the full impact of the acts on celtic is not yet fully known 
the health benefit cost ratio minimum does not apply to other centene subsidiaries

table of contents overview revenues and revenue recognition our health plans generate revenues primarily from premiums we receive from the states in which we operate 
we receive a fixed premium per member per month pursuant to our state contracts 
we generally receive premium payments during the month we provide services and recognize premium revenue during the period in which we are obligated to provide services to our members 
in some instances  our base premiums are subject to an adjustment  or risk score  based on the acuity of our membership 
generally  the risk score is determined by the state analyzing submissions of processed claims data to determine the acuity of our membership relative to the entire state s membership 
some contracts allow for additional premium associated with certain supplemental services provided such as maternity deliveries 
revenues are recorded based on membership and eligibility data provided by the states  which may be adjusted by the states for updates to this data 
these eligibility adjustments have been immaterial in relation to total revenue recorded and are reflected in the period known 
our specialty services generate revenues under contracts with state programs  healthcare organizations  and other commercial organizations  as well as from our own subsidiaries 
revenues are recognized when the related services are provided or as ratably earned over the covered period of services 
premium and service revenues collected in advance are recorded as unearned revenue 
for performance based contracts  we do not recognize revenue subject to refund until data is sufficient to measure performance 
premium and service revenues due to us are recorded as premium and related receivables and are recorded net of an allowance based on historical trends and our management s judgment on the collectibility of these accounts 
as we generally receive payments during the month in which services are provided  the allowance is typically not significant in comparison to total revenues and does not have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition or results of operations 
some states enact premium taxes  similar assessments and provider pass through payments  collectively  premium taxes  and these taxes are recorded as a component of revenues as well as operating expenses 
in  one of the states in which we operate increased their premium which was required to be passed through to hospitals in the state 
for the years ended december  and  this pass through totaled million and million 
we exclude premium taxes from our key ratios as we believe the premium tax is a pass through of costs and not indicative of our operating performance 
operating expenses medical costs medical costs include payments to physicians  hospitals  and other providers for healthcare and specialty services claims 
medical costs also include estimates of medical expenses incurred but not yet reported  or ibnr  and estimates of the cost to process unpaid claims 
we use our judgment to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of the required ibnr estimate 
the assumptions we consider include  without limitation  claims receipt and payment experience and variations in that experience  changes in membership  provider billing practices  healthcare service utilization trends  cost trends  product mix  seasonality  prior authorization of medical services  benefit changes  known outbreaks of disease or increased incidence of illness such as influenza  provider contract changes  changes to medicaid fee schedules  and the incidence of high dollar or catastrophic claims 
our development of the ibnr estimate is a continuous process which we monitor and refine on a monthly basis as claims receipts and payment information becomes available 
as more complete information becomes available  we adjust the amount of the estimate  and include the changes in estimates in medical expense in the period in which the changes are identified 
additionally  we contract with independent actuaries to review our estimates on a quarterly basis 
the independent actuaries provide us with a review letter that includes the results of their analysis of our medical claims liability 
we do not solely rely on their report to adjust our claims liability 
we utilize their calculation of our claims liability only as additional information  together with management s judgment to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of our liability for medical costs 
while we believe our ibnr estimate is appropriate  it is possible future events could require us to make significant adjustments for revisions to these estimates 
accordingly  we can not assure you that healthcare claim costs will not materially differ from our estimates 
results of operations depend on our ability to manage expenses associated with health benefits and to accurately predict costs incurred 
the health benefits ratio  or hbr  represents medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues excluding premium taxes and reflects the direct relationship between the premium received and the medical services provided 
cost of services cost of services expense includes the pharmaceutical costs associated with our pharmacy benefit manager s external revenues and certain direct costs to support the functions responsible for generation of our services revenues 
these expenses consist of the salaries and wages of the professionals who provide the services and associated expenses 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses  or g a  primarily reflect wages and benefits  including stock compensation expense  and other administrative costs associated with our health plans  specialty companies and centralized functions that support all of our business units 
our major centralized functions are finance  information systems and claims processing 
g a expenses also include business expansion costs  such as wages and benefits for administrative personnel  contracting costs  and information technology buildouts  incurred prior to the commencement of a new contract or health plan 
the g a expense ratio represents g a expenses as a percentage of premium and service revenues  and reflects the relationship between revenues earned and the costs necessary to earn those revenues 
other income expense other income expense consists principally of investment income from cash and investments  earnings in equity method investments  and interest expense on debt 
discontinued operations in november  we announced our intention to sell certain assets of uhp  our new jersey health plan 
accordingly  the results of operations for uhp are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
we completed the sale in the first quarter of year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues premium and service revenues increased in over as a result of membership growth discussed under the heading membership  and net premium rate increases in the premium rates specified in our state contracts are generally updated on an annual basis through contract amendments 
in  we received premium rate adjustments in certain markets which yielded a net composite increase across all of our markets 
the increase in premium and service revenues was moderated by the removal of pharmacy services in two states in these pharmacy carve outs had the effect of reducing revenue by approximately million during 
table of contents operating expenses medical costs the table below depicts the hbr for our external membership by member category year ended december  medicaid and chip abd and medicare specialty services total the consolidated hbr of for represented a increase from the consolidated hbr of 
the increase is mainly due to our florida and texas health plans and is partially offset by improvements from our georgia health plan 
the impact from our florida health plan is due to the higher hbr we have experienced in this market combined with the growth in membership and revenue from to the texas health plan performance was impacted in as member mix shifted to less favorable hbr categories 
the improvements from the georgia health plan are due to provider network and utilization management initiatives 
general and administrative expenses the consolidated g a expense ratio for the years ended december  and was and  respectively 
the decrease in the ratio in primarily reflects the leveraging of our expenses over higher revenues  partially offset by an increase in contributions to our charitable foundation as well as increased business expansion costs

as a result of tightening our investment criteria for municipal securities  we sold municipal securities resulting in net gains of million during also in  we received distributions from the reserve primary fund of million resulting in a gain of recorded for the distributions received in excess of our adjusted basis 
interest expense increased reflecting the borrowings on the loans associated with the construction of our corporate headquarters 
the real estate development was placed in service in the third quarter and accordingly we ceased capitalizing interest on the project 
the increase was partially offset by the reduction in debt outstanding under our revolving credit agreement as a result of the equity offering completed during the first quarter of income tax expense excluding the amounts attributable to noncontrolling interest  our effective tax rate in was compared to in the increase in was primarily driven by legislation enacted in may in the state of georgia which replaced the state income tax with a premium tax for medicaid managed care organizations effective july  accordingly  a deferred tax asset of million related to georgia state net operating loss carry forwards was written off during the second quarter 
additionally  the increase in the effective tax rate in was also related to a decrease in tax exempt interest and an increase in state income taxes 
discontinued operations pre tax earnings related to discontinued operations consisting solely of the new jersey health plan operations were million in compared to a pre tax loss of million in as a result of the sale of certain assets of the new jersey operations in march  we recognized a pre tax gain of million  which was million after tax  or per diluted share

the premium rates specified in our state contracts are generally updated on an annual basis through contract amendments 
in  we received premium rate increases in certain markets which yielded a composite increase across all of our markets 
in november  we received a contract amendment from the state of georgia providing for an effective premium rate increase in georgia effective july  the state of georgia returned the fully executed contract in january and  accordingly  we recorded the additional revenue  retroactive to july   in the first quarter of the premium revenue  related to the period from july  to december   totals approximately million 
contract amendments related to rate increases for the georgia health plan effective july  and july  were not fully executed until the respective fourth quarters and accordingly  the premium revenue from july to september was recorded in the fourth quarter in each respective year 
operating expenses medical costs the table below depicts the hbr for our external membership by member category year ended december  medicaid and chip abd and medicare specialty services total the consolidated hbr for the year ended december  was  an increase of over the increase in the total hbr in as compared to is due to the effect of the following items recording the georgia premium rate increase for the period from july  to december  during the first quarter of had the effect of decreasing the hbr in by  a march  rate decrease for our chip perinate product in texas which brought the hbr more in line with our normal range  higher hbr in our florida market  and additional costs related to the flu 
these factors were partially offset by reductions in the hbr for our abd product  particularly due to provider network improvements and exiting certain markets in ohio  and growth in our south carolina abd membership which operates at a lower hbr than our normal range 
the decrease in our abd hbr lowered our total hbr by for the year ended december  general and administrative expenses the consolidated g a expense ratio for the years ended december  and was and  respectively

table of contents regulatory capital and dividend restrictions our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries 
as managed care organizations  these subsidiaries are subject to state regulations that  among other things  require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital  as defined by each state  and restrict the timing  payment and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to us 
generally  the amount of dividend distributions that may be paid by a regulated subsidiary without prior approval by state regulatory authorities is limited based on the entity s level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus 
our subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum capital requirements prescribed by various regulatory authorities in each of the states in which we operate 
as of december   our subsidiaries had aggregate statutory capital and surplus of million  compared with the required minimum aggregate statutory capital and surplus requirements of million and we estimate our risk based capital  or rbc  percentage to be in excess of of the authorized control level 
the national association of insurance commissioners has adopted rules which set minimum risk based capital requirements for insurance companies  managed care organizations and other entities bearing risk for healthcare coverage 
as of december   each of our health plans were in compliance with the risk based capital requirements enacted in those states 
recent accounting pronouncements for this information  refer to note  summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to the consolidated financials statements  included herein 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events  and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses  and the related disclosures 
we base our assumptions  estimates and judgments on historical experience  current trends and other factors we believe to be relevant at the time we prepared our consolidated financial statements 
on a regular basis  we review the accounting policies  assumptions  estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with gaap 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates  and such differences could be material 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note  summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
our accounting policies regarding medical claims liability and intangible assets are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management 
as a result  they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
we have reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 
medical claims liability our medical claims liability includes claims reported but not yet paid  or inventory  estimates for claims incurred but not reported  or ibnr  and estimates for the costs necessary to process unpaid claims at the end of each period 
we estimate our medical claims liability using actuarial methods that are commonly used by health insurance actuaries and meet actuarial standards of practice 
these actuarial methods consider factors such as historical data for payment patterns  cost trends  product mix  seasonality  utilization of healthcare services and other relevant factors 
actuarial standards of practice generally require that the medical claims liability estimates be adequate to cover obligations under moderately adverse conditions 
moderately adverse conditions are situations in which the actual claims are expected to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims at the time of estimate 
in many situations  the claims amounts ultimately settled will be different than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice 
we include in our ibnr an estimate for medical claims liability under moderately adverse conditions which represents the risk of adverse deviation of the estimates in our actuarial method of reserving 
we use our judgment to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of the required estimates 
the assumptions we consider when estimating ibnr include  without limitation  claims receipt and payment experience and variations in that experience  changes in membership  provider billing practices  healthcare service utilization trends  cost trends  product mix  seasonality  prior authorization of medical services  benefit changes  known outbreaks of disease or increased incidence of illness such as influenza  provider contract changes  changes to fee schedules  and the incidence of high dollar or catastrophic claims 
we apply various estimation methods depending on the claim type and the period for which claims are being estimated 
for more recent periods  incurred non inpatient claims are estimated based on historical per member per month claims experience adjusted for known factors 
incurred hospital inpatient claims are estimated based on known inpatient utilization data and prior claims experience adjusted for known factors 
for older periods  we utilize an estimated completion factor based on our historical experience to develop ibnr estimates 
the completion factor is an actuarial estimate of the percentage of claims incurred during a given period that have been received or adjudicated as of the reporting period to the estimate of the total ultimate incurred costs 
when we commence operations in a new state or region  we have limited information with which to estimate our medical claims liability 
see risk factors failure to accurately predict our medical expenses could negatively affect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
these approaches are consistently applied to each period presented 
additionally  we contract with independent actuaries to review our estimates on a quarterly basis 
the independent actuaries provide us with a review letter that includes the results of their analysis of our medical claims liability 
we do not solely rely on their report to adjust our claims liability 
we utilize their calculation of our claims liability only as additional information  together with management s judgment to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of our liability for claims 
our development of the medical claims liability estimate is a continuous process which we monitor and refine on a monthly basis as additional claims receipts and payment information becomes available 
as more complete claim information becomes available  we adjust the amount of the estimates  and include the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the changes are identified 
in every reporting period  our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical claims liability estimates associated with previously reported periods 
we consistently apply our reserving methodology from period to period 
as additional information becomes known to us  we adjust our actuarial model accordingly to establish medical claims liability estimates 
the paid and received completion factors  claims per member per month and per diem cost trend factors are the most significant factors affecting the ibnr estimate 
the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our operating results caused by changes in these factors based on december  data completion factors cost trend factors decrease increase in factors increase decrease in medical claims liabilities decrease increase in factors increase decrease in medical claims liabilities in thousands in thousands reflects estimated potential changes in medical claims liability caused by changes in completion factors

table of contents while we believe our estimates are appropriate  it is possible future events could require us to make significant adjustments for revisions to these estimates 
for example  a increase or decrease in our estimated medical claims liability would have affected net earnings by million for the year ended december  the estimates are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our providers and information available from other outside sources 
the change in medical claims liability is summarized as follows in thousands year ended december  balance  january acquisitions incurred related to current year prior years total incurred paid related to current year prior years total paid balance  december claims inventory  december days in claims payable days in claims payable is a calculation of medical claims liability at the end of the period divided by average expense per calendar day for the fourth quarter of each year 
the acquisition in includes reserves acquired in connection with our acquisition of celtic 
medical claims are usually paid within a few months of the member receiving service from the physician or other healthcare provider 
as a result  the liability generally is described as having a short tail  which causes less than of our medical claims liability as of the end of any given year to be outstanding the following year 
we believe that substantially all the development of the estimate of medical claims liability as of december  will be known by the end of changes in estimates of incurred claims for prior years are primarily attributable to reserving under moderately adverse conditions 
in addition  claims processing initiatives yielded increased claim payment recoveries and coordination of benefits related to prior year dates of service 
changes in medical utilization and cost trends and the effect of medical management initiatives may also contribute to changes in medical claim liability estimates 
while we have evidence that medical management initiatives are effective on a case by case basis  medical management initiatives primarily focus on events and behaviors prior to the incurrence of the medical event and generation of a claim 
accordingly  any change in behavior  leveling of care  or coordination of treatment occurs prior to claim generation and as a result  the costs prior to the medical management initiative are not known by us 
additionally  certain medical management initiatives are focused on member and provider education with the intent of influencing behavior to appropriately align the medical services provided with the member s acuity 
in these cases  determining whether the medical management initiative changed the behavior cannot be determined 
because of the complexity of our business  the number of states in which we operate  and the volume of claims that we process  we are unable to practically quantify the impact of these initiatives on our changes in estimates of ibnr 
the following medical management initiatives may have contributed to the favorable development through lower medical utilization and cost trends appropriate leveling of care for neonatal intensive care unit hospital admissions  other inpatient hospital admissions  and observation admissions  in accordance with interqual criteria 
tightening of our pre authorization list and more stringent review of durable medical equipment and injectibles 
emergency department  or ed  program designed to collaboratively work with hospitals to steer non emergency care away from the costly ed setting through patient education  on site alternative urgent care settings  etc 
increase emphasis on case management and clinical rounding where case managers are nurses or social workers who are employed by the health plan to assist selected patients with the coordination of healthcare services in order to meet a patient specific healthcare needs 
incorporation of disease management which is a comprehensive  multidisciplinary  collaborative approach to chronic illnesses such as asthma 
goodwill and intangible assets we have made several acquisitions that have resulted in our recording of intangible assets 
these intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships  purchased contract rights  provider contracts  trade names and goodwill 
at december   we had million of goodwill and million of other intangible assets 
intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method over the following periods intangible asset amortization period purchased contract rights years provider contracts years customer relationships years trade names years our management evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that may affect the estimated useful life or the recoverability of the remaining balance of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets 
if the events or circumstances indicate that the remaining balance of the intangible asset or goodwill may be impaired  the potential impairment will be measured based upon the difference between the carrying amount of the intangible asset or goodwill and the fair value of such asset 
our management must make assumptions and estimates  such as the discount factor  future utility and other internal and external factors  in determining the estimated fair values 
while we believe these assumptions and estimates are appropriate  other assumptions and estimates could be applied and might produce significantly different results 
goodwill is reviewed annually during the fourth quarter for impairment 
in addition  an impairment analysis of intangible assets would be performed based on other factors 
these factors include significant changes in membership  state funding  medical contracts and provider networks and contracts 
the fair value of all reporting units with material amounts of goodwill was substantially in excess of the carrying value as of our annual impairment testing date

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk investments as of december   we had short term investments of million and long term investments of million  including restricted deposits of million 
the short term investments generally consist of highly liquid securities with maturities between three and months 
the long term investments consist of municipal  corporate and us agency bonds  life insurance contracts  us treasury investments  asset backed securities and equity securities and have maturities greater than one year 
restricted deposits consist of investments required by various state statutes to be deposited or pledged to state agencies 
due to the nature of the states requirements  these investments are classified as long term regardless of the contractual maturity date 
our investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market rates increase 
assuming a hypothetical and immediate increase in market interest rates at december   the fair value of our fixed income investments would decrease by approximately million 
declines in interest rates over time will reduce our investment income 
for a discussion of the interest rate risk that our investments are subject to  see risk factors risks related to our business our investment portfolio may suffer losses from reductions in market interest rates and changes in market conditions which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or liquidity 
inflation while the inflation rate in for medical care costs was slightly less than that for all items  historically inflation for medical care costs has generally exceeded that for all items 
we use various strategies to mitigate the negative effects of healthcare cost inflation 
specifically  our health plans try to control medical and hospital costs through our state savings initiatives and contracts with independent providers of healthcare services 
through these contracted care providers  our health plans emphasize preventive healthcare and appropriate use of specialty and hospital services 
additionally  our contracts with states require actuarially sound premiums that include health care cost trend 
while we currently believe our strategies to mitigate healthcare cost inflation will continue to be successful  competitive pressures  new healthcare and pharmaceutical product introductions  demands from healthcare providers and customers  applicable regulations or other factors may affect our ability to control the impact of healthcare cost increases
