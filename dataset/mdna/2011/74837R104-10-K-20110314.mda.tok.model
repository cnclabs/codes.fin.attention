item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis md a is intended to help readers of our financial statements understand our business  results of operations  financial condition  liquidity and capital resources 
md a is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with  the other sections of this annual report 
until the sale of all of our interests in kgs  we conducted our operations in two segments our more dominant exploration and production segment  and our significantly smaller gathering and processing segment 
except as otherwise specifically noted  or as the context requires otherwise  and except to the extent that differences between these segments or our geographic segments are material to an understanding of our business taken as a whole  we present this md a on a consolidated basis 
our md a includes the following sections overview a general description of our business  the value drivers of our business  measurements  and opportunities  challenges and risks highlights a summary of significant activities and events affecting quicksilver capital program a summary of our planned capital expenditures during financial risk management information about debt financing and financial risk management results of operations an analysis of our consolidated results of operations for the three years presented in our financial statements liquidity  capital resources and financial position an analysis of our cash flows  sources and uses of cash  contractual obligations and commercial commitments critical accounting estimates a discussion of critical accounting estimates that represent choices between acceptable alternatives and or require management judgments and assumptions 
overview we are a fort worth  texas based independent oil and gas company engaged in the acquisition  exploration  development  exploitation and production of natural gas  ngls  and oil 
we focus primarily on unconventional reservoirs onshore in north america where hydrocarbons may be found in challenging geological conditions such as fractured shales  coal beds and tight sands 
we generate revenue  income and cash flows by producing and selling natural gas  ngls and oil 
we conduct acquisition  exploration  development  exploitation and production activities to replace the reserves that we produce 
at december   of our proved reserves were natural gas and ngls 
consistent with one of our business strategies  we continue to develop and apply our unconventional resources expertise to our development projects in the barnett shale and horseshoe canyon 
our barnett shale asset and horseshoe canyon asset reserves made up and  respectively  of our proved reserves at december  our acreage in the horn river basin provides us the most immediate additional opportunity for further application of this expertise 
we focus on three key value drivers reserve growth  production growth  and maximizing our operating margin 
our reserve growth relies on our ability to apply our technical and operational expertise to explore  develop and exploit unconventional reservoirs 
we strive to increase reserves and production through aggressive management of our operations and through relatively low risk development and exploitation drilling 
we will also continue to identify high potential exploratory projects with comparatively higher levels of financial risk 
all of our development and exploratory programs are aimed at providing us with opportunities to develop and exploit unconventional reservoirs which align to our technical and operational expertise 

table of contents acreage that we hold in our core operating areas is well suited for production increases through development and exploitation drilling 
we perform workover and infrastructure projects to reduce ongoing operating costs and enhance current and future production rates 
we regularly review the properties we operate to determine if steps can be taken to efficiently increase reserves and production 
in evaluating the result of our efforts  we consider the capital efficiency of our drilling program and also measure the following key indicators organic reserve growth  production volume  cash flow from operating activities  and earnings per share 
years ended december  organic reserve growth production volume bcfe cash flow from operating activities in millions diluted earnings loss per share this ratio is calculated by subtracting beginning of the year proved reserves from adjusted end of the year proved reserves and dividing by beginning of the year proved reserves 
adjusted end of the year reserves are calculated by adding back divested reserves and production and deducting acquired reserves from end of the year reserves 
highlights strategic alternatives for quicksilver in october  members of the darden family the darden investor group sent a letter to our board of directors in which they expressed an interest in pursuing strategic alternatives for quicksilver  including potentially taking us private 
in response  our board of directors has formed a committee of independent directors to consider any transaction that may be proposed by the darden investor group  as well as alternative transactions 
the transaction committee retained independent legal and financial advisors 
on february   the darden investor group publicly indicated that it had confidence in the executability of a transaction that valued our common stock at a price in excess of per share and would be interested in submitting a proposal subject to certain conditions described in its february  letter to our board of directors 
on february   we amended our amended and restated rights agreement in connection with a request from the darden investor group 
the amendment permits the darden investor group to engage in discussions with a potential co investor regarding a possible acquisition of the company 
we are presently unable to assess the most likely outcome from this process or its impact on our stock price  financial position or results of operations 
crestwood transaction  hill county dry system and midstream operations we completed the sale of all our interests in our publicly traded midstream partnership to crestwood in october the crestwood transaction included our conveying a ownership interest in quicksilver gas services holdings llc  which owned  common units of kgs   subordinated units of kgs representing limited partner interests in kgs  of the outstanding membership interests in quicksilver gas services gp llc including  general partner units in kgs and of the outstanding incentive distribution rights in kgs  and  a subordinated promissory note issued to us by kgs with a carrying value of million at september  we received million from crestwood including million in november from kgs for third quarter distributions and transaction costs that we paid 
we recognized a gain of million 
we have the right to 
table of contents receive up to an additional million in future earn out payments in and  although no amounts attributable to the earn out payments have been recognized through december  under the agreements governing the crestwood transaction  both parties agreed for two years not to solicit employees of the other party and we agreed not to compete with kgs with respect to the gathering  treating and processing of natural gas and the transportation of natural gas liquids in denton  hood  somervell  johnson  tarrant  parker  bosque and erath counties within the barnett shale 
thomas f 
darden continues as a director to kgs general partner s board of directors  where he may serve until the later of october  or such time as we generate less than of kgs consolidated revenue in any fiscal year 
in connection with the closing of the crestwood transaction  we are providing transitional services to kgs through march  on customary terms 
kgs and we also entered into an agreement for the joint development of areas governed by certain of our existing commercial agreements and further  we amended our existing commercial agreements 
the most significant amendments include extending the terms of all gathering agreements with kgs through and establishing a fixed gathering rate of per mcf in the gathering system in the alliance leasehold 
in september  our board of directors approved a plan for disposal of our hcds  which gathers natural gas and delivers it to unaffiliated pipelines for further transport and sale downstream 
as a result of the decision  we conducted an impairment analysis of the hcds and recognized impairment expense of million 
we have continued to report our interests sold in the crestwood transaction and the hcds as part of our continuing operating results because our use of their midstream services subsequent to the closing of the crestwood transaction constitutes a continuation of service that precludes presentation of those businesses as discontinued operations under gaap 
the assets and liabilities of these operations have been reclassified and are segregated in our consolidated balance sheets 
the following summarizes the significant items related to our midstream operations years ended december  in thousands income loss before income taxes for midstream operations kgs midstream operations hcds midstream impairment expense transaction costs results of midstream operations before income tax income tax expense results of midstream operations  net of income tax lake arlington acquisition in may  we completed the acquisition of an additional working interest in our company operated lake arlington project 
we acquired the additional working interests for which we conveyed million in cash and  of the bbep units that we owned 
the acquired interests include proved natural gas reserves of bcf of which were proved developed 
as a result of our conveyance of million bbep units for the acquired properties  we recognized a million gain as other income in the second quarter of 
table of contents bbep update in april  we finalized a global settlement agreement with bbep and all other parties to our lawsuit whereby we received million in cash 
pursuant to the agreement  we retained full voting rights for our units held in bbep subject to the provisions of a limited standstill agreement and have named two directors to the board of directors of bbep s general partner 
bbep also agreed to the reinstitution of the bbep quarterly distributions and other governance accommodations 
the million settlement was recognized as other income in the second quarter of we also received quarterly distributions totaling million in completion of the acquisition of additional working interests in the lake arlington project in may and the sale of million bbep units in september reduced our ownership of to 
in october  we sold an additional  bbep units and recognized a gain of million 
subsequent to the october unit sale  our ownership of bbep decreased to as of december  horn river basin exploration we brought two wells online in our horn river asset in the last half of in  we spent million for exploration and infrastructure development to bring our third and fourth wells online during the fourth quarter and to initiate construction on infrastructure to gather  compress and deliver gas to third party processing facilities 
increase in production daily production increased during from the production increase is discussed further in results of operations below 
capital program we have budgeted our capital program to be spent in the following areas greater green southern barnett river alberta total horn horseshoe total total shale basin basin other us river canyon other canada company in millions  except wells drilling and completion midstream infrastructure leasehold acquisition corporate and other assets total budgeted capital wells drilled net wells completed net for all of  we expect our average production to be greater than our fourth quarter average production rate as we continue to develop our acreage in the barnett shale and conduct further exploration on our horn river asset  the greater green river basin and the southern alberta asset 
financial risk management we have established internal control policies and procedures for managing risk within our organization 
the possibility of decreasing prices received for our natural gas  ngl and oil production is among the several risks that we face 
we seek to manage this risk by entering into derivative contracts which we strive to treat as financial hedges 
we have mitigated the downside risk of adverse price movements through the use of derivatives but  in doing so  have also limited our ability to benefit from favorable price movements 
this commodity price strategy enhances our ability to execute our development  exploitation and exploration programs  meet debt service requirements and pursue acquisition opportunities even in periods of price volatility or depression

table of contents the following table summarizes the changes in our natural gas  ngl and oil revenue natural gas ngl oil total in thousands revenue for volume variances hedge settlement variances price variances revenue for volume variances hedge settlement variances price variances revenue for natural gas revenue for increased from as a result of increases in production 
the increase in natural gas volume from our barnett shale asset was primarily the result of wells brought online during canadian natural gas production increased as production from our horn river asset increased mmcfd to mmcfd for a decrease in production from our horseshoe canyon asset due to decreased capital spending was partially offset by increased production from our horn river asset 
higher market prices for natural gas in increased revenue  but the increase was offset by a decrease from hedge settlements 
the increase in ngl revenue for was due to increased market prices partially offset by payments made to settle hedges in and a decrease in production from our barnett shale asset compared to ngl production decreased primarily because we have focused our capital spending in areas of the barnett shale where dry natural gas is prevalent 
our natural gas revenue for increased from as a result of increases in production partially offset by a decrease in realized prices 
decreased market prices for natural gas in reduced revenue  but this reduction was largely offset by a million increase from hedge settlements 
the increase in us natural gas volume is due to wells brought online principally in our barnett shale asset during these increases were partially offset by lower volume resulting from the eni transaction in june and natural production declines from existing wells in our barnett shale asset 
canadian natural gas production increased due in part to wells placed into service during the third and fourth quarters of in our horn river asset 
ngl revenue for decreased primarily due to lower realized ngl prices for as compared to realized ngl prices decreased despite the absence of million paid for hedge settlements in partially offsetting the price decrease were increases in production 
production in our barnett shale asset increased due to wells brought online during  lower field pressures and improved ngl recoveries from the corvette plant  which was placed into service by kgs during the first quarter of oil revenue for was lower than due to decreases in market prices and oil production for as compared to

table of contents for all of  we expect our lease operating expense to be less than our fourth quarter rate per mcfe due to a higher concentration of our production in our barnett shale asset  which features lower lease operating costs on a per mcfe basis 
us lease operating expense was lower for despite a production increase from  primarily due to cost containment efforts in our barnett shale asset during lease operating expense per mcfe in our barnett shale asset for decreased from as a result of lower saltwater disposal costs  price reductions  and our stringent efforts to contain costs through vendor bidding processes  bulk purchasing and additional reliance on automation of well operations 
canadian lease operating expense for was unchanged from canadian lease operating expense per mcfe for decreased because of production increases 
lease operating expense on a canadian dollar basis for compared to increased c million or due primarily to the canadian production increase 
gathering  processing and transportation expense years ended december  in thousands  except per unit amounts per per per mcfe mcfe mcfe barnett shale other us total us horseshoe canyon horn river total canada total gpt for compared to increased primarily due to the loss of fees earned by kgs for gathering and processing production from our barnett shale asset following the closing of the crestwood transaction 
kgs revenue earned from gathering and processing production from our barnett shale asset  net of associated operating expense  averaged million per quarter for the first three quarters of fourth quarter gpt consisted primarily of fees charged by kgs 
canadian gpt increased for both in total dollars and on a per mcfe basis primarily as a result of transportation fees associated with higher production from our horn river asset for for all of  we expect gpt to increase from the fourth quarter per mcfe rate due to anticipated production increases in higher gpt cost areas and the sale of midstream operations in the crestwood transaction 
us gpt for were higher than although us production increased from on a per mcfe basis  gpt decreased as a result of an increase in the production of dry gas from our lake arlington project and our alliance leasehold in as compared to 
table of contents production and ad valorem taxes years ended december  in thousands  except per unit amounts per per per production taxes mcfe mcfe mcfe us canada total production taxes ad valorem taxes us canada total ad valorem taxes total production taxes for reflect a increase in realized prices before hedge settlements for production from our barnett shale asset and an increase in production volume from our barnett shale asset when compared to higher us ad valorem taxes for reflect the addition of wells  particularly in areas with higher ad valorem tax rates  and increases to ad valorem tax rates assessed by taxing entities in texas when compared to us production taxes for decreased by from because of the decrease in realized prices before hedge settlements in our barnett shale asset partially offset by increased production 
us ad valorem taxes for reflect the addition of wells and midstream facilities in our barnett shale asset during as compared to depletion  depreciation and accretion years ended december  in thousands  except per unit amounts depletion per mcfe per mcfe per mcfe us canada total depletion depreciation of other fixed assets us canada total depreciation accretion total us depletion expense for was less than as a decrease in the us depletion rate was partially offset by an increase in us production 
changes in the us canadian dollar exchange rate accounted for million of the increase in canadian depletion expense 
to a lesser extent  increased canadian production also contributed to the increase in canadian depletion expense 
both our us and canadian depletion rates have been impacted by the impairment charges recognized during the 
table of contents canadian depletion rate has been further impacted by evaluated horn river basin capital costs and future development costs included in proved reserve estimates at december  the decrease in us depreciation expense as compared to is the result of the sale of kgs 
kgs depreciation expense through september was million as compared to million for all of depletion expense for was relatively unchanged from as production increases were almost entirely offset by lower depletion rates 
our us depletion expense increased due primarily to the increase in us production volume 
both our us and canadian depletion rates were impacted by impairment charges 
us impairment charges were recognized in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of canadian impairment charges were recognized in the first  second and fourth quarters of changes in the us canadian dollar exchange rate also contributed to lower canadian depletion expense and the canadian depletion rate per mcfe 
we expect that our consolidated depletion rate for will be comparable to that of the fourth quarter 
the change in the exchange rate decreased canadian depletion million when comparing to the million increase in us depreciation for as compared to was primarily associated with the addition of gathering and processing facilities in our barnett shale asset 
impairment expense as required under gaap  we perform quarterly ceiling tests to assess impairment of our oil and gas properties 
we also assess our fixed assets reported outside the full cost pool when circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred 
information detailing the calculation of any impairment is more fully described in our critical accounting policies found below and in note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report 
in  we recognized impairment expense of million 
as a result of the decision by our board of directors to approve a plan for disposal of our hcds  we conducted an impairment analysis of the hcds and recognized a million non cash charge for impairment 
we also recognized a non cash million charge for impairment of our canadian oil and gas properties 
our canadian full cost pool has undergone significant change associated with the cost of bringing our initial horn river asset wells online and associated field costs while the proved reserves recognized have been limited due to the lack of any substantial production history for the area 
we recognized non cash charges totaling million for impairments related to both our us and canadian oil and gas properties in the primary factor that caused the decrease in the future cash flows from our proved oil and gas reserves was lower benchmark natural gas prices at march  for the us and canada and further canadian price decreases at june  additionally  reductions in the expected canadian capital investment for the following and month periods at june  further decreased canadian future net cash flows from our proved oil and gas reserves 
at september   the unamortized cost of our canadian oil and gas properties exceeded the full cost ceiling limitation by million 
as permitted by full cost accounting rules in effect at that date  improvements in aeco spot natural gas prices subsequent to september  eliminated the necessity to record a charge for impairment 
use of the unweighted average of the preceding month first day of the month prices as required by the sec effective december   resulted in a fourth quarter impairment of our canadian oil and gas properties 
we recognized a non cash charge of million for impairment related to our us oil and gas properties in december the impairment charge was primarily a result of significantly lower natural gas and ngl prices at year end when compared to year end additionally  we determined that exploration costs incurred for evaluation of the delaware basin of west texas would become part of the us full cost pool and no longer be excluded from depletion 
as part of the evaluation of our activities in the delaware basin  we conducted an analysis of our midstream assets in west texas for impairment 
we recorded an impairment charge of million to reduce the midstream assets to their estimated fair values 

table of contents general and administrative expense years ended december  in thousands  except per unit amounts per mcfe per mcfe per mcfe cash expense litigation settlement equity compensation total general and administrative expense for was million greater than due to an increase in stock based compensation expense  which included million for the vesting of all of kgs unvested stock based compensation at the time of its sale 
legal and professional fees for  however  were million lower than in primarily due to settlement of our litigation with bbep in april and a decrease in litigation settlement costs 
these decreases were partially offset by million incurred in for transaction costs  principally investment banking and legal fees  related to the crestwood transaction 
for all of  we expect general and administrative expense per mcfe to be less than the full year rate due to the absence of expense attributable to kgs prior to the crestwood transaction 
despite a decrease in litigation resolution costs  legal fees increased million because of our litigation with bbep  the eni transaction and various other corporate matters 
non cash expense for stock based compensation in increased million when compared to gain on sale of kgs in october  we recognized a million gain upon closing of the crestwood transaction 
further information regarding the transaction can be found in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
income from earnings of bbep we record our portion of bbep s earnings during the quarter in which their financial statements become publicly available 
as a result  our and annual results of operations include bbep s earnings for the months ended september  and  respectively 
our results of operations reflect bbep s earnings from november   when we acquired bbep units  through september  we recognized income of million for equity earnings from our investment in bbep based upon its reported earnings for the month period ended september  as compared to income of million recognized in bbep continues to experience significant volatility in its net earnings primarily due to changes in the value of its derivative instruments for which it does not employ hedge accounting 
additionally  we reduced our ownership of bbep units in as of december   we owned bbep units representing of total bbep units outstanding 
during  we recognized million for equity earnings from our investment in bbep 
the increase in equity earnings recognized during compared with is primarily due to mark to market accounting rendered by bbep on its derivative portfolio 
impairment of investment in bbep during the first quarter of  we evaluated our investment in bbep for impairment in response to further decreases in prevailing commodity prices and the bbep unit price after december  as a result of these decreases  we made the determination that the decline in value was other than temporary 
accordingly  our impairment analysis  which utilized the march  closing price of per bbep 
table of contents unit  resulted in aggregate fair value of million for the portion of bbep units that we owned 
the million aggregate fair value was compared to the million carrying value of our investment in bbep 
we recorded the difference of million as an impairment charge during the first quarter of a similar analysis was performed at each subsequent quarter end of and  which resulted in no further impairment 
note to our consolidated financial statements found in item of this annual report contains additional information regarding our investment in bbep 
during the fourth quarter of  our management considered the fair value of the bbep units along with the fair value trend of its peers  the trend and future petroleum strip prices and the limited availability of credit which occurred in the latter half of based on these factors  management determined that the decrease in fair value of bbep units was other than temporary and recorded a charge of million to reduce the carrying value of our investment in bbep to its fair value 
other income in  we settled our litigation against bbep and received million 
we also recognized a gain of million from the conveyance of million bbep common units as consideration in the acquisition of additional working interests in our lake arlington project in may gains totaling million were recognized in september and october from the sale of million bbep common units 
note to the consolidated financial statements found in this annual report contains additional information about these transactions 
interest expense years ended december  in thousands interest costs on debt outstanding add non cash interest non cash loss on early debt extinguishment less interest capitalized interest expense amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discount 
interest costs on debt outstanding for were higher than primarily because of the full year impact of the senior notes due and senior notes due being outstanding 
overall interest expense was lower in than due to the absence of million of expense related to the early retirement of a portion of our debt in we do not have a practice of maintaining higher debt balances throughout the quarter and minimizing them at quarter end for financial reporting purposes 
for all of  we expect interest expense to be less than the full year amount due to interest expense attributable to kgs prior to the crestwood transaction 
interest costs for were higher than primarily because of higher outstanding debt balances  which included the issuance of our senior notes due in june and our senior notes due in august the proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes due were used to fully repay the senior secured second lien credit facility in june at that time  we recognized additional interest expense of million for the remaining unamortized original issue discount and deferred financing costs associated with the senior secured second lien facility 
interest rate swaps entered into in june partially offset increases of interest expense by million for 
table of contents income taxes years ended december  in thousands income tax expense benefit effective tax rate our income tax provision increased from due primarily to higher income before taxes including the gain recognized on the sale of kgs and gains recognized from the disposition or sale of a portion of our bbep units 
also  the impact of permanent items for non deductible expense impact the income tax rate applied to pre tax income in and pre tax loss in additionally  we recognized an assessment of million in canada related to a predecessor s activities in the increase in our effective tax rate from the effective tax rate was primarily the result of us and state income tax rates applied to the gains recognized from our sale of kgs and disposition of bbep units 
for  our effective rate in the us was and in canada  excluding the million assessment  it was 
our us operations generated more than of our pre tax income 
our income tax provision for changed from due to a million reduction of pre tax earnings that resulted primarily from higher aggregate impairment charges for our oil and gas properties recognized during when compared to the effective tax rate for was affected by the resulting taxable net losses in both the us and canada that were taxed at and  respectively

liquidity  capital resources and financial position cash flow activity operating cash flows years ended december  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operations for decreased from  primarily due to our lower realized prices including hedging effects  an increase in income tax payments and an increase in cash payments for interest 
these reductions of operating cash were partially offset by payment received for settlement of our bbep litigation and an additional million in bbep distributions in as compared to cash flows provided by operating activities in increased from because of a net million increase in production revenue  including commodity derivative settlements  and receipt of a million us federal income tax refund as compared to income tax payments of million in other components of cash flows provided by operations for decreased million for additional interest 
table of contents payments on our outstanding debt  net of interest rate derivative settlements  and increased losses from third party natural gas purchase and sale activity of million as compared to additionally  the cash distributions we receive on our bbep units decreased million from to million as bbep eliminated quarterly distributions 
the remaining increase in operating cash flows was a result of lower operating and general and administrative expense and the timing of cash receipts and disbursements that affected working capital 
investing cash flows years ended december  in thousands purchases of property  plant and equipment alliance acquisition proceeds from sale of kgs lp proceeds from sale of bbep units proceeds from sales of properties equipment net cash provided used by investing activities for each of the three years ended december   we have spent significant cash resources for the development of our large acreage positions in our core areas in the barnett shale and horseshoe canyon 
in addition  our expenditures for gas processing and gathering assets grew significantly from the growth of kgs 
we completed several significant transactions during the three years ended december   including the crestwood transaction in with net cash proceeds of million after transaction costs  the eni transaction with net cash proceeds of million and our alliance acquisition for cash of billion 
our purchases of property  plant and equipment in continued to reflect our decision to reduce our exploration and development activity in response to low natural gas and ngl prices 
exploration and development costs incurred were million in total costs incurred in of million  included million of bbep units conveyed in the lake arlington project acquisition 
costs incurred for facilities and other equipment were million  which includes more than million for horn river basin facilities 
another million of our remaining expenditures were related primarily to expansion of midstream facilities owned by kgs 
we reduced our exploration and development activity from levels in response to lower natural gas and ngl prices 
of the million of cash paid for property  plant and equipment during  was invested in our oil and natural gas properties and was invested in our gas gathering and processing operations 
we drilled net wells in the barnett shale and net wells in horseshoe canyon 
our midstream capital investment of million was primarily related to expansion of our gas processing and gathering facilities in our barnett shale asset 
in  we purchased wells  producing wells and unfinished wells  in the alliance acquisition and drilled net wells in the barnett shale and net wells in horseshoe canyon 
additionally  the assets purchased in the alliance acquisition included a gathering system and we invested million and million for gas gathering and processing facilities in the barnett shale and horseshoe canyon  respectively

the completion of our obligation under the gas purchase commitment during also contributed to the use of cash by financing activities 
net financing cash flows for reflect our efforts to restructure and reduce our debt outstanding at december  in  we received total proceeds of million from the issuance of our senior notes due with a principal amount of million and our senior notes due with a principal amount of million 
the senior notes due bear interest at the rate of paid semiannually on january and july the senior notes due bear interest at the rate of paid semiannually on february and august borrowings and repayments in under the senior secured credit facility were million and million  respectively  which resulted in a net decrease of million outstanding in kgs increased borrowings under the kgs credit agreement by million in proceeds from the debt issuances and the eni transaction in were used to repay and terminate the remaining indebtedness under our senior secured second lien facility and to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under the senior secured credit facility 
the kgs secondary offering  completed in december  resulted in net proceeds of million 
liquidity and borrowing capacity during the fourth quarter of  our senior secured credit facility maturity was extended by one year and now matures on february  the senior secured credit facility availability is governed by a borrowing base and determined annually by the lenders taking into consideration the estimated value of oil and gas properties and any other relevant information  all in accordance with their customary practices for oil and gas loans in effect from time to time 
at december   the borrowing base and commitments were billion and the aggregate letter of credit capacity was million 
the senior secured credit facility provides us an option to increase availability by up to million  with a maximum of billion with lender consents and additional commitments 
we can also extend the maturity date up to two additional years with lenders approval 
the facility provides for revolving loans  swingline loans and letters of credit from time to time in an aggregate amount not to exceed the lesser of the borrowing base or commitments

we have also pledged a portion of our equity interests in bbep to secure our obligations under the senior secured credit facility 
at december   there was 
table of contents million available under the facility 
our ability to remain in compliance with the financial covenants in our credit facilities may be affected by events beyond our control  including market prices for our products 
any future inability to comply with these covenants  unless waived by the requisite lenders  could adversely affect our liquidity by rendering us unable to borrow further under our credit facilities and by accelerating the maturity of our indebtedness 
additional information about our debt and related covenants are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report 
we believe that our capital resources are adequate to meet the requirements of our existing business 
we anticipate that our capital expenditure program will be substantially funded by cash flow from operations  but expect that we will also utilize the senior secured credit facility 
depending upon conditions in the capital markets and other factors  we will from time to time consider the issuance of debt or other securities  other possible capital markets transactions or the sale of assets  the proceeds of which could be used to refinance current indebtedness or for other corporate purposes 
we will also consider from time to time additional acquisitions of  and investments in  assets or businesses that complement our existing asset portfolio 
acquisition transactions  if any  are expected to be financed through cash on hand and from operations  bank borrowings  the issuance of debt or other securities or a combination of those sources 
financial position the following impacted our balance sheet as of december   as compared to our balance sheet as of december  our net property  plant and equipment balance increased million from december  to december  our property  plant and equipment balances increased by million because of costs incurred for property  plant and equipment and assets recognized when retirement obligations were established for new wells and facilities 
changes for us canadian exchange rates further increased our property  plant and equipment balances million 
offsetting the increases was dd a and impairment expense of million 
our current and non current derivative assets and liabilities increased million on a net basis 
we received million for settlement of commodity derivatives and million for settlement of interest rate derivatives 
the million increase in the valuation of our open derivative positions at december  more than offset these decreases 
our current deferred income tax liability related to our derivatives decreased because of changes in the allocation of open derivative positions between the us and canada and the difference between us and canadian statutory tax rates 
long term debt was reduced by net repayments on the senior secured credit facility of million using proceeds from the crestwood transaction 
we have also classified the outstanding balance of our contingently convertible debentures as current as the holders of the debentures can require us to repay all or a portion of the debentures on november  these decreases were slightly offset by the deferral of gains from our settled interest rate swap derivatives for million which will continue to be recognized as a reduction of interest expense over terms of the associated debt instruments 
our net deferred income tax position changed from a net asset position of million to a net liability position of million primarily because of deferred income tax expense recognized on the gains from sales of kgs and bbep units and income 
completion of the sale of kgs reduced net assets and net liabilities for our midstream business held for sale and noncontrolling equity 
at december   net assets and net liabilities held for sale remain only for the hcds 

table of contents contractual obligations and commercial commitments contractual obligations 
information regarding our contractual and scheduled interest obligations  at december   is set forth in the following table 
payments due by period less than more than total year years years years in thousands long term debt scheduled interest obligations gpt contracts drilling rig contracts purchase obligations asset retirement obligations unrecognized tax benefits operating lease obligations total obligations long term debt 
as of december   our outstanding indebtedness included million of senior notes due  million of senior notes due  million of senior notes due  million of senior subordinated notes  million of contingently convertible debentures all before original issue discount and outstanding amounts under our senior secured credit facility 
based upon our debt outstanding and interest rates as of december   we anticipate interest payments  including our scheduled interest obligations  to be million in should we be required to borrow on our senior secured credit facility and based on interest rates as of december   each million in borrowings would result in additional annual interest payments of million 
if the current borrowing availability under our senior secured credit facility were to be fully utilized by year end at interest rates as of december   we estimate that annual interest payments would increase by million 
if interest rates increase on our december  variable debt balances of million our annual pre tax income would decrease or increase by million 
scheduled interest obligations 
as of december   we had scheduled interest payments of million annually on our senior notes due  million annually on our senior notes due  million annually on our senior notes due  million annually on our million of senior subordinated notes  million annually on our million of contingently convertible debentures and million annually on our senior secured credit facility 
gathering  processing and transportation contracts 
under contracts with various third parties  we are obligated to provide minimum daily natural gas volume for gathering  processing  fractionation or transportation  as determined on a monthly basis  or pay for any volume deficiencies at a specified reservation fee rate 
our production is expected to exceed the daily volume provided in the contracts 
drilling rig contracts 
we utilize drilling rigs from third parties in our development and exploration programs 
the outstanding drilling rig contracts require payment of a specified day rate ranging from  to  for the entire lease term regardless of our utilization of the drilling rigs 
purchase obligations 
at december   we were under contract to purchase goods and services for use in field and gas plant operations 
asset retirement obligations 
our obligations result from the acquisition  construction or development and the normal operation of our long lived assets 
unrecognized tax benefits 
we have recorded obligations that have resulted from tax benefit claims in our tax returns that do not meet the recognition standard of more likely than not to be sustained upon 
table of contents examination by tax authorities 
at december   million of the unrecognized tax benefits  if recognized  would reduce our effective tax rate 
operating lease obligations 
we lease office buildings and other property under operating leases 
commercial commitments 
we had the following commercial commitments as of december  amounts of commitments by expiration period less than more than total year years years years in thousands surety bonds standby letters of credit total surety bonds 
our surety bonds have been issued to fulfill contractual  legal or regulatory requirements 
surety bonds generally have an annual renewal option 
standby letters of credit 
our letters of credit have been issued to fulfill contractual or regulatory requirements  including million issued to provide credit support for surety bonds 
all of these letters of credit were issued under our senior secured credit facility and generally have an annual renewal option 
during we expect our utilization of letters of credit to increase in support of transportation contracts in the horn river basin by up to million 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
in connection with the preparation of our financial statements  we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events  and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expense and the related disclosures 
we base our assumptions  estimates and judgments on historical experience  current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time we prepare our consolidated financial statements 
on a regular basis  management reviews the accounting policies  assumptions  estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with gaap 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ materially from our assumptions and estimates 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
management believes that the following accounting estimates are the most critical in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results  and they require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with our audit committee 
oil and gas reserves policy description proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of oil  natural gas  and ngls that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
under the current rule adopted by the sec in december  we incorporated the following changes into our proved reserve process and related disclosures for and include the use of an unweighted average of the preceding month first day of the month prices for determination of proved reserve values included in calculating full cost ceiling limitations and for annual proved reserve disclosures  
table of contents consideration of and limitations on the types of technologies that may be used to reliably establish and estimate proved reserves  reporting of investments and progress made during the year to convert proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves  and  reporting on the independence and qualifications of our personnel and independent petroleum engineers who are responsible for the preparation of our reserve estimates 
operating costs are the period end operating costs at the time of the reserve estimate and are held constant into future periods 
our estimates of proved reserves are determined and reassessed at least annually using available geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data 
revisions may result from changes in  among other things  reservoir performance  prices  economic conditions and governmental restrictions 
our proved reserve estimates and related disclosures for and are presented in compliance with this new rule 
our proved reserve estimates and related disclosures were prepared in compliance with the sec rule then in effect 
the current sec rule allows pud reserves to be booked beyond one offset location where reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances  whereas the prior rule allowed recognizing only one offset 
in accordance with the current rule  we recognized incremental pud locations in our barnett shale asset 
in our barnett shale asset  we had proved undeveloped gas well locations at december   including locations that are more than one offset 
additional information regarding our proved oil and gas reserves may be found under oil and natural gas reserves found in item of this annual report 
judgments and assumptions all of the reserve data in this annual report are based on estimates 
estimates of our oil  natural gas and ngl reserves are prepared in accordance with guidelines established by the sec 
reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating recoverable underground accumulations of oil  natural gas and ngls 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating recoverable quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves 
uncertainties include the projection of future production rates and the expected timing of development expenditures 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
as a result  reserve estimates may be different from the quantities of oil  natural gas and ngls that are ultimately recovered 
the passage of time provides more qualitative information regarding estimates of reserves  and revisions are made to prior estimates to reflect updated information 
the weighted average annual revisions to our reserve estimates over the last four years have been less than of the weighted average previous year s estimate excluding revisions due to price changes 
however  there can be no assurance that more significant revisions will not be necessary in the future 
if future significant revisions are necessary that reduce previously estimated reserve quantities  it could result in a ceiling test related impairment 
in addition to the impact of the estimates of proved reserves on the calculation of the ceiling limitation  estimation of proved reserves is also a significant component of the calculation of depletion expense 
for example  if estimates of proved reserves decline  the depletion rate will increase  resulting in a decrease in net income 
full cost ceiling calculations policy description we use the full cost method to account for our oil and gas properties 
under the full cost method  all costs associated with the acquisition  exploration  development and exploitation of oil and gas properties are capitalized and accumulated in cost centers on a country by country basis 
this includes any internal costs that are directly related to development and exploration activities  but does not include any costs related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
proceeds received from disposals are credited against accumulated cost except when the sale represents a significant disposal of reserves  in which case a gain or loss is calculated and recognized 
the application of the full cost method generally results in higher capitalized costs and higher depletion rates compared to its alternative  the successful efforts method 
the 
table of contents sum of net capitalized costs and estimated future development and dismantlement costs for each cost center is depleted on the equivalent unit of production basis using proved oil and gas reserves 
excluded from amounts subject to depletion are costs associated with unevaluated properties 
under the full cost method  net capitalized costs are limited to the lower of unamortized cost reduced by the related net deferred tax liability and asset retirement obligations or the cost center ceiling 
the cost center ceiling is defined as the sum of estimated future net revenue  discounted at per annum  from proved reserves  based on the unweighted average of the preceding month first day of the month prices year end prices for adjusted to reflect local differentials and contract provisions  unescalated year end costs and financial derivatives that hedge our oil and gas revenue  the cost of properties not being amortized  the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties included in the cost being amortized less income tax effects related to differences between the book and tax bases of the oil and gas properties 
if the net book value reduced by the related net deferred income tax liability and asset retirement obligations exceeds the cost center ceiling limitation  a non cash impairment charge is required 
judgments and assumptions the discounted present value of future net cash flows from our proved oil  natural gas and ngl reserves is the major component of the ceiling calculation  and is determined in connection with the estimation of our proved oil  natural gas and ngl reserves 
estimates of reserves are forecasts based on engineering data  projected future rates of production and the timing of future expenditures 
the process of reserve estimation requires substantial judgment  resulting in imprecise determinations  particularly for new discoveries 
different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserve quantities based on the same data 
while the quantities of proved reserves require substantial judgment  the associated prices of natural gas  ngl and oil reserves  and the applicable discount rate  that are used to calculate the discounted present value of the reserves do not require judgment 
the current sec rule requires the use of the future net cash flows from proved reserves discounted at 
therefore  the future net cash flows associated with the proved reserves is not based on our assessment of future prices or costs 
in calculating the ceiling  we adjust the future net cash flows by the discounted value of derivative contracts in place that hedge future prices 
this valuation is determined by calculating the difference between reserve pricing and the contract prices for such hedges also discounted at 
because the ceiling calculation dictates that our historical experience be held constant indefinitely and requires a discount factor  the resulting value is not necessarily indicative of the fair value of the reserves or the oil and gas properties 
oil and natural gas prices have historically been volatile 
at any time that we conduct a ceiling test  forecasted prices can be either substantially higher or lower than our historical experience 
also  marginal borrowing rates may be well below the required used in the calculation 
rates below  if they could be utilized  would have the effect of increasing the otherwise calculated ceiling amount 
therefore  oil and gas property ceiling test related impairments that result from applying the full cost ceiling limitation  and that are caused by fluctuations in price as opposed to reductions to the underlying quantities of reserves  should not be viewed as absolute indicators of a reduction of the ultimate value of the related reserves 
derivative instruments policy description we enter into financial derivative instruments to mitigate risk associated with the prices received from our production 
we may also utilize financial derivative instruments to hedge the risk associated with interest rates on our outstanding debt 
we account for our derivative instruments by recognizing qualifying derivative instruments on our balance sheet as either assets or liabilities measured at their fair value determined by reference to published future market prices and interest rates 
for derivative instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges  the effective portions of gains or losses are deferred in other comprehensive income and recognized in earnings during the period in which the hedged 
table of contents transactions are realized 
gains or losses on qualified derivative instruments terminated prior to their original expiration date are deferred and recognized as income or expense in the period in which the hedged transaction is recognized 
if the hedged transaction becomes probable of not occurring  the deferred gain or loss is immediately recorded to earnings 
the ineffective portion of the hedge relationship is recognized currently as a component of other revenue 
the fair values of natural gas and ngl derivatives are estimated using published market prices of natural gas and ngls for the periods covered by the contracts 
estimates are determined by applying the net differential between the prices in each derivative and market prices for future periods  to the volume stipulated in each contract to arrive at an estimated value of future cash flow streams 
these estimated future cash flow values are then discounted for each contract at rates commensurate with federal treasury instruments with similar contractual lives to arrive at estimated fair value 
for derivative instruments that qualify as fair value hedges the gains or losses on the derivative instruments are recognized currently in earnings and the changes in value of the hedged items are also recognized currently in earnings 
any gains or losses on the derivative instruments not offset by the gains or losses on the hedged items are recognized as the value of ineffectiveness in the hedge relationships 
for interest rate swaps that qualify as fair value hedges of our fixed rate debt outstanding  ineffectiveness is recognized currently as a component of interest expense 
the fair value of all interest rate derivatives is estimated using published libor interest rates for the periods covered by the contracts 
the estimates are determined by applying the net differential between the interest rate in each derivative and interest rates for future periods  to the notional amount stipulated in each contract to arrive at estimated future cash flow streams 
judgments and assumptions the estimates of the fair values of our commodity and interest rate derivative instruments require substantial judgment 
valuations are based upon multiple factors such as futures prices  volatility data from major oil and gas trading points  length of time to maturity and interest rates 
we compare our estimates of fair value for these instruments with valuations obtained from independent third parties and counterparty valuation confirmations 
the values we report in our financial statements change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results 
future changes to forecasted or realized commodity prices could result in significantly different values and realized cash flows for such instruments 
stock based compensation policy description an estimate of fair value is determined for all share based payment awards 
recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards is recognized over the vesting period for each award 
judgments and assumptions estimating the grant date fair value of our stock based compensation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to determine the grant date fair value of our awards 
these assumptions and judgments include estimating the future volatility of our stock price  expected dividend yield  future employee turnover rates and future employee stock option exercise behaviors 
changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions that we use to determine stock based compensation expense 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to changes in stock based compensation expense that could be material 
if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions used  the stock based compensation expense reported in our financial statements may not be representative of the actual economic cost of the stock based compensation 

table of contents income taxes policy description deferred income taxes are established for all temporary differences between the book and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
in addition  deferred tax balances must be adjusted to reflect tax rates that we expect will be in effect during years in which we expect the temporary differences will reverse 
canadian taxes are computed at rates in effect or expected to be in effect in canada 
us deferred tax liabilities are not recognized on profits that are expected to be permanently reinvested in canada and thus are not considered available for distribution to us 
net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets are reviewed annually for recoverability  and if necessary  are recorded net of a valuation allowance 
judgments and assumptions we must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and provide judgment on the amount of financial statement benefit that an uncertain tax position will realize upon ultimate settlement 
to the extent that we believe that a more than probability exists that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized  we must establish a valuation allowance 
significant management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets and in determining the amount of financial statement benefit to record for uncertain tax positions 
we consider all available evidence  both positive and negative  to determine whether  based on the weight of the evidence  a valuation allowance is needed and consider the amounts and probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate settlement of an uncertain tax position using the facts  circumstances and information available at the reporting date to establish the appropriate amount of financial statement benefit 
evidence used for the valuation allowance includes information about our current financial position and results of operations for the current and preceding years  as well as all currently available information about future years  including our anticipated future performance  the reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities and tax planning strategies available to us 
to the extent that a valuation allowance or uncertain tax position is established or changed during any period  we would recognize expense or benefit within our consolidated tax expense 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements within the meaning of item a of sec regulation s k 
recently issued accounting standards the information regarding recent accounting pronouncements materially affecting our consolidated financial statements is included in note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report  which is incorporated herein by reference

in february  we entered into new interest swaps to hedge the same debt instruments 
we executed early settlement of a portion of the interest rate swaps in may and the remaining interest swaps in july for million and million  respectively 
these settlements included million for interest previously accrued and earned 
the remaining cash of million was recognized as a fair value adjustment to our debt  which will continue to be recognized as a reduction of interest expense over the life of the associated underlying debt instruments

the fair value of all derivative instruments included in these disclosures was estimated using prices quoted in active markets for the periods covered by the derivatives and the value confirmed by counterparties 
estimates were determined by applying the net differential between the prices in each derivative and market prices for future periods to the amounts stipulated in each contract to arrive at an estimated future value 
this estimated future value was discounted on each contract at rates commensurate with federal treasury instruments with similar contractual lives 
foreign currency risk our canadian subsidiary uses the canadian dollar as its functional currency 
to the extent that business transactions in canada are not denominated in canadian dollars  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
for  and  non functional currency transactions resulted in losses of million  million  and million  respectively  included in net earnings 
furthermore  the senior secured credit facility permits canadian borrowings to be made in either us or canadian denominated amounts 
however  the aggregate borrowing capacity of the entire facility is calculated using the us dollar equivalent 
accordingly  there is a risk that exchange rate movements could impact our available borrowing capacity
