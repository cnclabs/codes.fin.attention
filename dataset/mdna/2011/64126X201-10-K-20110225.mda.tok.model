overview in the first quarter of  we realigned our organizational structure and internal financial reporting by customer type to reflect our strategic focus which is to serve our customers more effectively 
this reorganization has resulted in two operating segments carrier services and enterprise services 
customers of the carrier services segment are comprised primarily of communications service providers  or carriers  and customers of the enterprise services segment are comprised primarily of non carrier  commercial businesses  or enterprises 
we anticipate that this new structure will give us a greater ability to create a solutions approach for our customers with value propositions focused on mission critical solutions for our customers  rather than simply targeting individual services 
in addition  this approach will enable greater efficiencies in our direct and indirect distribution channels 
revenue growth  profitability and cash generation was strong in our consolidated revenue for the year increased to million as compared to million from our cash flows from operations for the year ended december  were million due to the increased demand for our services and our disciplined cost management 
this resulted in total cash  cash equivalents and investments of million as of december  our revenue increase of million was primarily driven by an established increase in the fixed fee under our contracts with the north american portability management llc  or napm  for our number portability administration center services  or npac services 
we recognized million of revenue under our contracts to provide npac services in  a million increase  or  from additionally  as internet traffic and web complexity increases  and the need for secure and scalable dns solutions rise  we continued to realize demand from our existing and new internet infrastructure services  or iis  customers

critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires us to utilize accounting policies and make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during a fiscal period 
the securities and exchange commission  or sec  considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to a company s financial condition and results of operations  and if it requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application 
we have discussed the selection and development of the critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed our related disclosures in this report 
although we believe that our judgments and estimates are appropriate and reasonable  actual results may differ from those estimates 
in addition  while we have used our best estimates based on the facts and circumstances available to us at the time  we reasonably could have used different estimates in the current period 
changes in the accounting estimates we use are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 
if actual results or events differ materially from those contemplated by us in making these estimates  our reported financial condition and results of operation could be materially affected 
see item a of this report  risk factors  for certain matters that may bear on our results of operations 
revenue recognition as part of our carrier services  we provide wireline and wireless number portability  implement the allocation of pooled blocks of telephone numbers and provide network management services pursuant to seven contracts with napm 
in  we recognized revenue under our contracts with napm primarily on a per transaction basis 
the aggregate fees for transactions processed under these contracts were determined by the total number of transactions 
in january  we amended our seven regional contracts with napm 
the aggregate fees for transactions processed under the amended contracts are determined by an annual fixed fee pricing model under which the annual fixed fee  or base fee  was set at million and million in and  respectively  and is subject to an annual price escalator of in subsequent years 
these amended contracts also provide for a fixed credit of million in  million in and million in  which will be applied to reduce the base fee for the applicable year 
additional credits of up to million annually in  and may be earned if the customers under these amended contracts reach certain levels of aggregate telephone number inventories and adopt and implement certain ip fields and functionality 
the amendments also enable our customers to earn credits if the volume of transactions in a given year is above or below the contractually established volume range for that year 
the determination of credits earned based on transaction volume is done annually at the end of the year and earned credits are applied to the following year s invoices 
to the extent any available additional credits expire unused at the end of a year  they will be recognized as revenue at that time 
we determine the fixed and determinable fee under these amended contracts on an annual basis at the beginning of each year and recognize this fee in our carrier services operating segment on a straight line basis over twelve months 
for  we concluded that the fixed and determinable fee equaled million  which represented the base fee of million reduced by the million fixed credit and million of available additional credits 
during  our carrier customers adopted and implemented the requisite ip fields and functionality  and as a result earned million of the additional credits for each of  and however  the customers did not reach the levels of aggregate telephone number inventories required to earn additional credits in and as a result  we recognized million of additional revenue in the fourth quarter of our total revenue recognized under our seven regional contracts with napm to provide npac services was million for the year ended december  for  we concluded that the fixed and determinable fee equaled million  which represented the base fee of million  reduced by the million fixed credit and million of available additional credits 
during  our carrier customers earned all of the available additional credits of million attributable to the adoption and implementation of the requisite ip fields and functionality and the achievement of specific levels of aggregate telephone number inventories 
fees under our contracts with napm are billed to telecommunications service providers based on their allocable share of the total transaction charges 
this allocable share is based on each respective telecommunications service provider s share of the aggregate end user services revenues of all us telecommunications service providers  as determined by the fcc 
under our contracts with napm  we also bill a revenue recovery collections  or rrc  fee of a percentage of monthly billings to our customers  which is available to us if any telecommunications service provider fails to pay its allocable share of total transactions charges 
if the rrc fee is insufficient for that purpose  these contracts also provide for the recovery of such differences from the remaining telecommunications service providers 
for more information regarding our revenue recognition policy  please see note to our consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report 
service level standards some of our private commercial contracts require us to meet service level standards and impose corresponding penalties for failure to meet those standards 
we record a provision for these performance related penalties when we become aware that we have failed to meet required service levels  which results in a corresponding reduction of our revenue 
restructuring as of december   the accrued liability associated with our restructuring and other related charges was million 
as part of our restructuring costs  we recorded a liability for the estimated cost of the net lease expense for facilities that we are no longer using 
this accrual is equal to the present value of the minimum future lease payments under our contractual lease obligations  offset by the present value of the estimated sublease income 
as of december   our accrued restructuring liability related to our net lease expense and other related charges was million 
these lease payments will be made over the remaining lives of the leases for facilities that we have vacated  the longest of which extends through if actual market conditions are different than those we have projected  we will be required to recognize additional restructuring costs or benefits associated with these facilities 
acquisitions we record acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting 
all of the assets acquired  liabilities assumed  contractual contingencies and contingent consideration  when applicable  are recognized at their fair value as of the acquisition date 
the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net tangible and net intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
the application of the purchase method of accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions in the determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in order to properly allocate purchase price consideration 
these assumptions and estimates reflect a market participant s expected use of the asset and the appropriate discount rates from a market participant perspective 
our estimates are based on historical experience  information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and includes assistance from an independent third party appraisal firm 
our significant assumptions and estimates can include  but are not limited to  the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future and the appropriate weighted average cost of capital 
these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
in addition  unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates 
during the year ended  we completed the acquisitions of browsermob llc and quova  inc and recorded values of million and million to goodwill  respectively  and million and million of definite lived intangible assets  respectively 
see note to our consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess purchase price paid over the fair value of tangible or identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in our acquisitions 
in accordance with the intangibles goodwill and other topic of the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  accounting standards codification  or asc  we test our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate an impairment may have occurred 
in the first quarter of  we realigned our operating structure and internal financial reporting by customer type  reflective of how our chief operating decision maker  or codm  allocates resources and assesses performance 
this realignment changed our operating segments and the underlying reporting units 
as a result of this realignment  we reassigned our goodwill to each of our reporting units 
the goodwill attributable to our former next generation messaging  or ngm  reporting unit has been assigned to our carrier services reporting unit 
the services  technology and customer base of our ngm business was renamed converged messaging services while the sales and marketing functions were transitioned to the broader carrier services reporting unit 
our goodwill attributable to our former clearinghouse reporting unit was allocated among each of our three reporting units  carrier services  internet infrastructure services and registry services  using a relative fair value approach 
we determined the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units for purposes of allocating our goodwill using both an income approach and a market approach 
we did not identify indicators of impairment in connection with this realignment 
our annual goodwill impairment analysis  which we performed for each of our three reporting units as of october   did not result in an impairment charge 
we determined the estimated fair value of our reporting units using the income approach and the market approach  consistent with the approach we utilized in our analysis performed in the first quarter of to assist in the process of determining fair value  we performed internal valuation analyses  considered other publicly available market information and obtained appraisals from external advisors 
significant assumptions used in the determination of fair value under the income approach included assumptions regarding market penetration  anticipated growth rates  and risk adjusted discount rates 
significant assumptions used in the determination of fair value under the market approach included the selection of comparable companies 
the key assumptions used in our annual goodwill impairment test to determine the fair value of our reporting units included a cash flow projections  which include growth and allocation assumptions for forecasted revenue and expenses  b a residual growth rate of to  c a discount rate of to  which was based upon each respective reporting unit s weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the risks associated with the operations at the time of the assessment  d selection of comparable companies used in the market approach  and e assumptions in weighting the results of the income approach and the market approach valuation techniques 
as of the date of our annual impairment test  our estimated fair values for each of our reporting units substantially exceeded each of our reporting units carrying value 
we believe that the assumptions and estimates used to determine the estimated fair values of each of our reporting units are reasonable  however  these estimates are inherently subjective  and there are a number of factors  including factors outside of our control that could cause actual results to differ from our estimates 
changes in estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge 
any changes to our key assumptions about our businesses and our prospects  or changes in market conditions  could cause the fair value of one of our reporting units to fall below its carrying value  resulting in a potential impairment charge 
in addition  changes in our organizational structure or how our management allocates resources and assesses performance  could result in a change of our operating segments or reporting units  requiring a reallocation and impairment analysis of our goodwill 
a goodwill impairment charge could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements because of the significance of goodwill to our consolidated balance sheet 
as of december   we had million and million  respectively  in goodwill for our carrier services and enterprise services operating segments 
impairment of long lived assets our long lived assets primarily consist of property and equipment and intangible assets 
we review long lived assets and identifiable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we measure recoverability of assets to be held and used by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets 
recoverability measurement and estimation of undiscounted cash flows is done at the lowest possible level for which there are identifiable cash flows 
if such assets fail the recoverability test  the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are recorded at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
management must exercise judgment in determining whether an event has occurred that may impair the value of the long lived assets 
factors that could indicate that impairment may exist include significant underperformance relative to a plan or long term projections  significant changes in business strategy  significant negative industry or economic trends or a significant decline in our stock price or in the value of our reporting units for a sustained period of time 
in the fourth quarter of  we decided to exit one of our ip services businesses  specifically our converged messaging business 
we believe that our decision to exit this business was an indicator of impairment for long lived assets in our converged messaging asset group 
as a result  in the fourth quarter of  we performed a recoverability test and determined that the future undiscounted cash flows of the asset group was less than the carrying value 
we recorded an million charge for impairment of long lived assets  the largest component of which consisted of capitalized technology 
in determining fair value  we utilized estimates from external advisors and valuation models that involved assumptions about replacement cost  obsolescence factors  future cash flows  discount rates and  as appropriate  review of market comparables 
we believe that the assumptions and estimates used to determine the estimated fair value of this asset group are reasonable  however  assumptions and estimates used by management that are incorporated within the estimated fair value of our converged messaging asset group may not reflect specific incentives or attributes of a particular buyer from which a sales price is determined and may result in further impairment or a loss on sale 
as of december   we had million in long lived assets in our converged messaging asset group 
accounts receivable  revenue recovery collections  and allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest 
in accordance with our contracts with napm  we bill an rrc fee of a percentage of monthly billings to our customers 
the aggregate rrc fees collected may be used to offset uncollectible receivables from an individual customer 
beginning july   the rrc fee was of monthly billings 
on july   the rrc fee was reduced to and further reduced to on july  any accrued rrc fees in excess of uncollectible receivables are paid back to the customers annually on a pro rata basis 
all other receivables related to services not covered by the rrc fees are evaluated and  if deemed not collectible  are appropriately reserved 
investments as of december   we have approximately million of investments in pre refunded municipal bonds that are secured by an escrow fund of us treasury notes 
these investments are accounted for as available for sale securities and unrealized gains or losses are recorded in other comprehensive income 
we determined the fair value of our investments using observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets 
as of december   we determined that any declines in the fair value of our investments are not other than temporary 
given the significance of investments to our consolidated balance sheet  declines in the fair value that are considered to be other than temporary could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
we are exposed to investment risk as it relates to changes in the market value of our investments 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
these deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such amounts are expected to reverse or be utilized 
the realization of deferred tax assets is contingent upon the generation of future taxable income 
when appropriate  we recognize a valuation allowance to reduce such deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be ultimately realized 
the calculation of deferred tax assets  including valuation allowances  and liabilities requires us to apply significant judgment related to such factors as the application of complex tax laws  changes in tax laws and our future operations 
we review our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis to determine if a valuation allowance is required based upon these factors 
changes in our assessment of the need for a valuation allowance could give rise to a change in such allowance  potentially resulting in additional expense or benefit in the period of change 
our income tax provision includes us federal  state  local and foreign income taxes and is based on pre tax income or loss 
in determining the annual effective income tax rate  we analyzed various factors  including our annual earnings and taxing jurisdictions in which the earnings were generated  the impact of state and local income taxes and our ability to use tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards 
we assess uncertain tax positions and recognize income tax benefits when  based on the technical merits of a tax position  we believe that if a dispute arose with the taxing authority and was taken to a court of last resort  it is more likely than not ie  a probability of greater than percent that the tax position would be sustained as filed 
if a position is determined to be more likely than not of being sustained  the reporting enterprise should recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority 
our practice is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 
tax years through remain open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions to which we are subject 
the internal revenue service  or irs  has initiated an examination of our federal income tax returns for the years and while the ultimate outcome of the audit is uncertain  we do not believe that the outcome will have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the irs completed an examination of our federal income tax returns for the years and the audit resulted in no material adjustments 
stock based compensation we recognize stock based compensation expense in accordance with the compensation stock compensation topic of the fasb asc which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for stock based awards based on estimated fair values on the date of grant 
we estimate the fair value of each option based award on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
this option pricing model requires that we make several estimates  including the option s expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock 
because stock based compensation expense is based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest  the amount of expense takes into account estimated forfeitures at the time of grant  which estimate may be revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
changes in these estimates and assumptions can materially affect the estimated fair value of our stock based compensation 
see note to our consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report for information regarding our assumptions related to stock based compensation and the amount of stock based compensation expense we incurred for the periods covered in this report 
as of december   total unrecognized compensation expense was million  which relates to unvested stock options  unvested restricted stock units  unvested restricted stock awards and unvested performance vested restricted stock units  or pvrsus  and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
we estimate the fair value of our restricted stock unit awards based on the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant 
our outstanding restricted stock unit awards are subject to service based vesting conditions and or performance based vesting conditions 
we recognize the estimated fair value of service based awards  net of estimated forfeitures  as stock based compensation expense over the vesting period on a straight line basis 
awards with performance based vesting conditions require the achievement of specific financial targets at the end of the specified performance period and the employee s continued employment over the vesting period 
we recognize the estimated fair value of performance based awards  net of estimated forfeitures  as stock based compensation expense over the vesting period  which considers each period or tranche separately  based upon our determination of whether it is probable that the performance targets and vesting will be achieved 
at each reporting period  we reassess the probability of achieving the performance targets within the related performance period 
determining whether the performance targets will be achieved involves judgment  and the estimate of stock based compensation expense may be revised periodically based on changes in the probability of achieving the performance targets 
if any performance goals are not met  no compensation cost is ultimately recognized against that goal  and  to the extent previously recognized  compensation cost is reversed 
as of december   we estimate achievement of  and of the performance targets related to our pvrsus granted during  and  respectively 
changes in our assumptions regarding the achievement of specific financial targets could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in the first quarter of  we revised our estimate of the achievement of the performance target related to the pvrsus granted during from of target to of target 
in addition  in the first quarter of we revised our estimate of achievement of the performance target related to the pvrsus granted during from of target to of target and further revised our estimate to of target in the fourth quarter of our consolidated net income for the year ended december  was million and diluted earnings per share was per share 
if we had continued to use the previous estimate of achievement of of the performance target for our pvrsus granted during  our as adjusted net income would have been approximately million and our as adjusted diluted earnings per share would have been approximately per share 
if we had continued to use the previous estimate of achievement of of the performance target for our pvrsus granted during  our as adjusted net income would have been approximately million and our as adjusted diluted earnings per share would have been approximately per share 
if we had continued to use the previous estimates of achievement for our pvrsus granted during and  our as adjusted net income would have been approximately million and our as adjusted diluted earnings per share would have been approximately per share

liquidity and capital resources our principal source of liquidity is cash provided by operating activities 
our principal uses of cash have been to fund working capital  capital expenditures  facility expansions  share repurchases  acquisitions and debt service requirements

the increase in net changes in operating assets and liabilities of million was primarily due to an increase of million in our accounts payable and accrued expenses and an increase of million in our income taxes payable 
non cash adjustments decreased million  primarily due to a decrease of million in goodwill impairment charges and a decrease of million in a long lived assets impairment charge  both recorded in the year ended december  the decreases of impairment charges included non cash adjustments that were partially offset by an increase in the net gains of million related to our short term investments

contractual obligations our principal commitments consist of obligations under leases for office space  computer equipment and furniture and fixtures 
the following table summarizes our long term contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period less than more than total year years years years in thousands capital lease obligations operating lease obligations total some of our commercial commitments are secured by standby letters of credit 
the following is a summary of our commercial commitments secured by standby letters of credit by commitment date as of december  less than more than total year years years years in thousands standby letters of credit the amounts presented in the tables above may not necessarily reflect our actual future cash funding requirements because the actual timing of the future payments made may vary from the stated contractual obligation 
in addition  due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december   we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority 
therefore  million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above

effect of inflation inflation generally affects us by increasing our cost of labor and equipment

off balance sheet arrangements we had no off balance sheet arrangements as of december  and item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of market risks  including changes in interest rates affecting the return on our investments and foreign currency fluctuations 
exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates affects the value of our investment portfolio 
we have not used derivative financial instruments to hedge against such risk in our investment portfolio 
we invest in securities of highly rated issuers and follow investment policies limiting  among other things  the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we seek to limit default risk by purchasing only investment grade securities 
we do not actively manage the risk of interest rate fluctuations on our short term investments  however  our exposure to this risk is mitigated by the relatively short term nature of these investments 
based on a hypothetical adverse movement in interest rates  the impact on our interest income for our short term investments for the year ended december  would have been insignificant 
we have accounts on our foreign subsidiaries ledgers which are maintained in the respective subsidiary s local foreign currency and remeasured into the united states dollar 
as a result  we are exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the united states dollar and against the currencies of other countries in which we sell services 
as of december   our assets and liabilities related to non dollar denominated currencies were primarily related to intercompany payables and receivables 
an increase or decrease of in foreign exchange rate would not have a material impact on our financial position 
because our sales and expense are primarily denominated in local currency  the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on sales and expenses has not been material  and we do not employ measures intended to manage foreign exchange rate risk
