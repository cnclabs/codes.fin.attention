our operating results for the year ended december  were favorably impacted by an increase in our total revenues  primarily driven by an increase in average monthly revenue per unit  including an increase in our ancillary services revenue  the inclusion of revenue from recent acquisitions and expansions  and an increase in occupancy 
although we have made significant progress in many areas of our business  the difficult operating environment has continued to result in occupancy rates that are lower than historical levels and diminished growth in the rates we charge our residents 
during  we continued our efforts to strengthen our financial position 
for example  in early  we entered into a new revolving credit facility with general electric capital corporation  as administrative agent 
the facility had an initial commitment of million  with an option to increase the commitment to million which we exercised during the second quarter  and was scheduled to mature on june  as discussed in more detail elsewhere in the annual report on form k  subsequent to december   we 
table of contents entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with general electric capital corporation  as administrative agent and lender  and the other lenders from time to time parties thereto 
the amended credit agreement amended and restated the previous credit agreement 
the amended credit agreement increased the commitment under the credit facility to million and extended the maturity date to january  effective february   the commitment under the amended credit agreement was further increased to million 
furthermore  we have refinanced  repaid or exercised extension options on a number of mortgage loans and  factoring in contractual extension options  have no mortgage debt maturities until other than periodic  scheduled principal payments 
as a result of our recent operating performance and the steps we have recently taken to improve our liquidity position  we ended the year with million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheet 
during  we engaged in a limited amount of acquisition activity 
we acquired the fee simple interest in four communities we previously operated under an operating lease 
the aggregate purchase price for the interest was million 
additionally  we purchased and entered into a sale leaseback arrangement with respect to one of our communities and acquired seven home health agencies during the year 
we believe that we are positioned to take advantage of favorable demographic trends and future supply demand dynamics in the senior living industry 
we also believe that we operate in the most attractive sectors of the senior living industry with significant opportunities to increase our revenues through providing a combination of housing  hospitality services  ancillary services and health care services 
our senior living communities offer residents a supportive home like setting  assistance with activities of daily living  or adls  and  in several communities  licensed skilled nursing services 
we also provide ancillary services  including therapy and home health services  to our residents 
our strategy is to be the leading provider of wellness and healthcare solutions within the senior living industry 
by providing residents with a range of service options as their needs change  we provide greater continuity of care  enabling seniors to age in place and thereby maintain residency with us for a longer period of time 
the ability of residents to age in place is also beneficial to our residents and their families who are concerned with care decisions for their elderly relatives 
we believe that there are substantial organic growth opportunities inherent in our existing portfolio 
we intend to take advantage of those opportunities by growing revenues  while maintaining expense control  at our existing communities  continuing the expansion and maturation of our ancillary services programs  expanding  redeveloping and repositioning our existing communities  and acquiring additional operating companies and communities 
growth strategy our primary growth objectives are to grow our revenues  adjusted ebitda  cash from facility operations and facility operating income 
key elements of our strategy to achieve these objectives include organic growth in our core business  including expense control and the realization of economies of scale 
we plan to grow our existing operations by increasing revenues through a combination of occupancy growth and monthly service fee increases as a result of our competitive strength and growing demand for senior living communities 
in addition  we intend to take advantage of our sophisticated operating and marketing expertise to retain existing residents and attract new residents to our communities 
we also plan to continue our efforts to achieve cost savings through the realization of additional economies of scale 
the size of our business has allowed us to achieve savings in the procurement of goods and services and increased efficiencies with respect to various corporate functions  and we expect that we can achieve additional savings and efficiencies 
growth through the continued expansion of our ancillary services programs including therapy  home health and hospice services 
we plan to grow our revenues by further expanding our innovative senior care program throughout our retirement centers  assisted living  ccrcs and management services segments 
this expansion includes expanding the scope of services provided at the communities currently served and the continuing rollout of home health to communities not currently serviced 
in addition  we plan to grow our revenues from ancillary services through the maturation of existing clinics 
through the innovative senior care program  we currently provide therapy  home health and other ancillary services  as well as education and wellness programs  to residents of many of our communities 
these programs are focused on wellness and physical fitness to allow residents to 
table of contents maintain maximum independence 
these services provide many continuing education opportunities for residents and their families through health fairs  seminars  and other consultative interactions 
the therapy services we provide include physical  occupational  speech and other specialized therapy and home health services 
the home health services we provide include skilled nursing  physical therapy  occupational therapy  speech language pathology  home health aide services as well as social services as needed 
in addition to providing these in house therapy and wellness services at our communities  we also provide these services to other senior living communities that we do not own or operate and to seniors living outside of our communities 
these services may be reimbursed under the medicare program or paid directly by residents from private pay sources and revenues are recognized as services are provided 
we also plan to begin offering hospice services in certain locations 
we believe that our innovative senior care program is unique in the senior living industry and that we have a significant advantage over our competitors with respect to providing ancillary services because of our established infrastructure and experience 
we believe there is a significant opportunity to grow our revenues by continuing to expand the scope of services at communities currently served and continuing the rollout of home health to additional communities  which we believe will increase our revenue per unit in the future 
as of december   we offered therapy services to approximately  of our units and home health services to approximately  of our units 
growth through the expansion  redevelopment and repositioning of existing communities 
through our program max initiative  we intend to grow our revenues and cash flows through the expansion  redevelopment and repositioning of certain of our existing communities where economically advantageous 
certain of our communities with stabilized occupancies and excess demand in their respective markets may benefit from additions and expansions which additions and expansions may be subject to landlord  lender and other third party consents offering increased capacity 
additionally  the community  as well as our presence in the market  may benefit from adding a new level of service for residents 
through program max  we may also reposition certain communities to meet the evolving needs of our customer 
this may include converting space from one level of care to another  reconfiguration of existing units  or the addition of services that are not currently present 
growth through the acquisition and consolidation of asset portfolios and other senior living companies 
as opportunities arise  we plan to continue to take advantage of the fragmented continuing care  independent living and assisted living sectors by selectively purchasing existing operating companies  asset portfolios  home health agencies and communities 
we may also seek to acquire the fee interest in communities that we currently lease or manage 
our acquisition strategy will continue to focus primarily on communities where we can improve service delivery  occupancy rates and cash flow 
the senior living industry the senior living industry is highly fragmented and characterized by numerous local and regional operators 
we are one of a limited number of national operators that provide a broad range of community locations and service level offerings at varying price levels 
the industry has seen significant growth in recent years and has been marked by the emergence of the assisted living segment in the mid s 
since the beginning of  the industry has been affected by the downturn in the housing market and by the declining economy in general 
in spite of these factors  over the past year  industry occupancy is essentially flat  with the fourth quarter of being the first since the first quarter of that occupancy in the industry did not decrease on an annual basis according to the national investment center for the seniors housing care industry nic 
according to nic  occupancy has declined basis points to in the independent living sector and has increased basis points to in the assisted living sector in the twelve months ended december  industry occupancy rates have been declining after reaching a cyclic high in early of according to nic 
the relatively stable occupancy during suggests that the senior housing industry may now be trending along a cyclical bottom 
new senior housing construction starts have slowed dramatically since late due to the continued impact of the economic recession  securing financing for new projects has been very difficult 
for the foreseeable future  there will likely be very limited amounts of new construction in senior living 
despite current economic conditions  we believe that a number of trends will contribute to the continued growth of the senior living industry in coming years 
the primary market for senior living services is individuals age 
table of contents and older 
according to us census data  the group is expected to grow by million through as a result of these demographic trends  we expect an increase in the demand for senior living services in future years 
we believe the senior living industry has been and will continue to be impacted by several other trends 
the use of long term care insurance is increasing among current and future seniors as a means of planning for the costs of senior living services 
in addition  as a result of increased mobility in society  a reduction of average family size and increased number of two wage earner couples  more seniors are looking for alternatives outside of their family for their care 
growing consumer awareness among seniors and their families concerning the types of services provided by independent and assisted living operators has further contributed to the opportunities in the senior living industry 
also  seniors currently possess greater financial resources than in the past  which makes it more likely that they are able to afford to live in market rate senior housing 
seniors in the geographic areas in which we operate tend to have a significant amount of assets generated from savings  pensions and  despite weakening in national housing markets  equity from the sale of private homes 
challenges in our industry include increased state and local regulation of the assisted living and skilled nursing sectors  which has led to an increase in the cost of doing business 
the regulatory environment continues to intensify in the number and types of laws and regulations affecting us  accompanied by increased enforcement activity by state and local officials 
in addition  like other companies  our financial results may be negatively impacted by increasing employment costs including salaries  wages and benefits  such as health care  for our employees 
increases in the costs of utilities  insurance  and real estate taxes may also have a negative impact on our financial results 
certain per person annual limits on medicare reimbursement for therapy services became effective in  subject to certain exceptions 
these exceptions are currently scheduled to expire on december  if these exceptions are modified or not extended beyond that date  our revenues and net operating income relating to our outpatient therapy services could be materially adversely impacted 
in addition  there continue to be various federal and state legislative and regulatory proposals to implement cost containment measures that would limit payments to healthcare providers in the future 
for example  the centers for medicare medicaid services cms recently published a decrease in home health rates for changes in the reimbursement policies of the medicare program could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow 
our history we were formed as a delaware corporation in june for the purpose of combining two leading senior living operating companies  brookdale living communities  inc  or blc  and alterra healthcare corporation  or alterra 
blc and alterra had been operating independently since and  respectively 
on november   we completed our initial public offering of common stock  and on july   we acquired american retirement corporation  or arc  another leading senior living provider which had been operating independently since our product offerings we offer a variety of senior living housing and service alternatives in communities located across the united states 
our primary product offerings consist of i retirement center communities  ii assisted living communities  and iii ccrcs 
as discussed below under segments  we also operate certain communities on behalf of third parties pursuant to management agreements 
retirement centers 
our retirement center communities are primarily designed for middle to upper income seniors generally age and older who desire an upscale residential environment providing the highest quality of service 
the majority of our retirement center communities consist of both independent and assisted living units in a single community  which allows residents to age in place by providing them with a continuum of senior independent and assisted living services 
while the number varies depending upon the particular community  approximately of all of the units at our retirement center communities are independent living units  with the balance of units licensed for assisted living 

table of contents our retirement center communities are large multi story buildings containing on average units with extensive common areas and amenities 
residents may choose from studio  one bedroom and two bedroom units  depending upon the specific community 
each retirement center community provides residents with basic services such as meal service  hour emergency response  housekeeping  concierge services  transportation and recreational activities 
most of these communities also offer custom tailored supplemental care services at an additional charge  which may include medication reminders  check in services and escort and companion services 
in addition  our innovative senior care program is currently available in most of our retirement centers communities 
through the program  we are able to offer our residents various education  wellness  therapy  home health and other ancillary services 
in addition to the basic services  our retirement center communities that include assisted living also provide residents with supplemental care service options to provide assistance with activities of daily living  or adls 
the levels of care provided to residents vary from community to community depending  among other things  upon the licensing requirements of the state in which the community is located 
residents in our retirement center communities are able to maintain their residency for an extended period of time due to the range of service options available to residents not including skilled nursing as their needs change 
residents with cognitive or physical frailties and higher level service needs are accommodated with supplemental services in their own units or  in certain communities  are cared for in a more structured and supervised environment on a separate wing or floor 
these communities also generally have a dedicated assisted living staff  including nurses at the majority of communities  and separate assisted living dining rooms and activity areas 
the communities in our retirement centers segment represent approximately of our total senior living capacity 
assisted living 
our assisted living communities offer housing and hour assistance with adls to mid acuity frail and elderly residents 
our assisted living communities include both freestanding  multi story communities with more than beds and smaller  freestanding single story communities with less than beds 
depending upon the specific location  the community may include i private studio  one bedroom and one bedroom deluxe apartments  or ii individual rooms for one or two residents in wings or neighborhoods scaled to a single family home  which includes a living room  dining room  patio or enclosed porch  laundry room and personal care area  as well as a caregiver work station 
under our clare bridge brand  we also operate memory care communities  which are freestanding assisted living communities specially designed for residents with alzheimer s disease and other dementias requiring the attention  personal care and services needed to help cognitively impaired residents maintain a higher quality of life 
our memory care communities have from to beds and some are part of a campus setting which includes a freestanding assisted living community 
all residents at our assisted living and memory care communities receive the basic care level  which includes ongoing health assessments  three meals per day and snacks  coordination of special diets planned by a registered dietitian  assistance with coordination of physician care  social and recreational activities  housekeeping and personal laundry services 
in some locations we offer our residents exercise programs and programs designed to address issues associated with early stages of alzheimer s and other forms of dementia 
in addition  we offer at additional cost higher levels of personal care services to residents at these communities who are very physically frail or experiencing early stages of alzheimer s disease or other dementia and who require more frequent or intensive physical assistance or increased personal care and supervision due to cognitive impairments 
we also offer our innovative senior care program at certain of our assisted living and memory care communities 
as a result of their progressive decline in cognitive abilities  residents at our memory care communities typically require higher levels of personal care and services and therefore pay higher monthly service fees 
specialized services include assistance with adls  behavior management and an activities program  the goal of which is to provide a normalized environment that supports residents remaining functional abilities 
whenever possible  residents participate in all facets of daily life at the residence  such as assisting with meals  laundry and housekeeping 

table of contents the communities in our assisted living segment including our memory care communities represent approximately of our total senior living capacity 
ccrcs 
our ccrcs are large communities that offer a variety of living arrangements and services to accommodate all levels of physical ability and health 
most of our ccrcs have independent living  assisted living and skilled nursing available on one campus  and some also include memory care alzheimer s service areas 
eleven of our ccrcs that we own or lease are entrance fee communities  in which residents in the independent living apartment units pay a one time upfront entrance fee  typically  to  or more  which fee is partially refundable in certain circumstances 
the amount of the entrance fee varies depending upon the type and size of the dwelling unit  the type of contract plan selected  whether the contract contains a lifecare benefit ie  a healthcare discount for the resident  the amount and timing of refund  and other variables 
these agreements are subject to regulations in various states 
in addition to their initial entrance fee  residents under all of our entrance fee agreements also pay a monthly service fee  which entitles them to the use of certain amenities and services 
since we receive entrance fees upon initial occupancy  the monthly fees are generally less than fees at a comparable rental community 
the refundable portion of a resident s entrance fee is generally refundable within a certain number of months or days following contract termination or upon the sale of the unit  or in some agreements  upon the resale of a comparable unit or months after the resident vacates the unit 
in addition  some entrance fee agreements entitle the resident to a refund of the original entrance fee paid plus a percentage of the appreciation of the unit upon resale 
we also offer a broad array of ancillary services  including therapy  home health  and other services through our innovative senior care program  to the residents of each of our ccrcs 
the communities in our ccrcs segment represent approximately of our total senior living capacity 
the independent living units at our entrance fee communities those units on which entry fees are paid represent of our total senior living capacity 
excluding managed communities and equity homes which are residences located on certain of our ccrc campuses that we do not generally own  entrance fee communities represent of our total senior living capacity 
competitive strengths we believe our nationwide network of senior living communities is well positioned to benefit from the growth and increasing demand in the industry 
some of our most significant competitive strengths are skilled management team with extensive experience 
our senior management team has extensive experience in acquiring  operating and managing a broad range of senior living assets  including experience in the senior living  healthcare  hospitality and real estate industries 
geographically diverse  high quality  purpose built communities 
as of december   we operate a nationwide base of purpose built communities in states  including communities in nine of the ten most populous standard metropolitan statistical areas 
ability to provide a broad spectrum of care 
given our diverse mix of retirement centers  assisted living communities and ccrcs  we are able to meet a wide range of our customers needs 
we believe that we are one of the few companies in the senior living industry with this capability and the only company that does so at scale on a national basis 
we believe that our multiple product offerings create marketing synergies and cross selling opportunities 
the size of our business allows us to realize cost and operating efficiencies 
we are the largest operator of senior living communities in the united states based on total capacity 
the size of our business allows us to realize cost savings and economies of scale in the procurement of goods and services 
our scale also allows us to achieve increased efficiencies with respect to various corporate functions 
we intend to utilize our expertise and size to capitalize on economies of scale resulting from our national platform 
our geographic footprint and centralized infrastructure provide us with a 
table of contents significant operational advantage over local and regional operators of senior living communities 
in connection with our formation transactions and our acquisitions  we negotiated new contracts for food  insurance and other goods and services 
in addition  we have and will continue to consolidate corporate functions such as accounting  finance  human resources  legal  information technology and marketing 
we began to realize these savings upon the completion of our formation transactions in september and have realized additional savings as we continued to consolidate and integrate various corporate functions 
significant experience in providing ancillary services 
through our innovative senior care program  we provide a range of education  wellness  therapy  home health and other ancillary services to residents of certain of our retirement centers  assisted living  and ccrc communities 
having therapy clinics and home health agencies located in our senior living communities to provide needed services to our residents is a distinct competitive difference 
we have significant experience in providing these ancillary services and expect to receive additional revenues as we expand our ancillary service offerings to additional communities and to seniors living outside of our communities 
segments as of december   we had four reportable segments retirement centers  assisted living  ccrcs  and management services 
these segments were determined based on the way that our chief operating decision makers organize our business activities for making operating decisions and assessing performance 
our management services segment includes the results of communities that we operate on behalf of third parties pursuant to management agreements 
information regarding the other segments is included above under our product offerings 
operating results from our four business segments are discussed further in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note to our consolidated financial statements included herein 
operations operations overview we believe that successful senior living operators must effectively combine the expertise and business disciplines of housing  hospitality  health care  marketing  finance and real estate 
we continually review opportunities to expand the types of services we provide to our residents 
to date  we have been able to increase our monthly revenue per unit each year and we have generally experienced increasing facility operating margins through a combination of the implementation of efficient operating procedures and the economies of scale associated with the size and number of our communities 
our operating procedures include securing national vendor contracts to obtain the lowest possible pricing for certain services such as food  energy and insurance  implementing effective budgeting and financial controls at each community  and establishing standardized training and operations procedures 
we have implemented intensive standards  policies and procedures and systems  including detailed staff manuals  which we believe have contributed to high levels of customer service and to improved facility operating margins 
we have centralized accounting controls  finance and other operating functions in our support centers so that  consistent with our operating philosophy  community based personnel can focus on resident care and efficient operations 
we have established company wide policies and procedures relating to  among other things resident care  community design and community operations  billings and collections  accounts payable  finance and accounting  risk management  development of employee training materials and programs  marketing activities  the hiring and training of management and other community based personnel  compliance with applicable local and state regulatory requirements  and implementation of our acquisition  development and leasing plans 

table of contents consolidated corporate operations support we have developed a centralized infrastructure and services platform  which provides us with a significant operational advantage over local and regional operators of senior living communities 
the size of our business also allows us to achieve increased efficiencies with respect to various corporate functions such as human resources  finance  accounting  legal  information technology and marketing 
we are also able to realize cost efficiencies in the purchasing of food  supplies  insurance  benefits  and other goods and services 
in addition  we have established centralized operations groups to support all of our product lines and communities in areas such as training  regulatory affairs  asset management  dining and procurement 
community staffing and training each community has an executive director responsible for the overall day to day operations of the community  including quality of service  social services and financial performance 
each executive director receives specialized training from us 
in addition  a portion of each executive director s compensation is directly tied to the operating performance of the community and key service quality measures 
we believe that the quality of our communities  coupled with our competitive compensation philosophy  has enabled us to attract high quality  professional community executive directors 
depending upon the size of the community  each executive director is supported by a community staff member who is directly responsible for day to day care of the residents and either community staff or regional support to oversee the community s marketing and community outreach programs 
other key positions supporting each community may include individuals responsible for food service  activities  housekeeping  and engineering 
we believe that quality of care and operating efficiency can be maximized by direct resident and staff contact 
employees involved in resident care  including the administrative staff  are trained in the support and care needs of the residents and emergency response techniques 
we have adopted formal training and evaluation procedures to help ensure quality care for our residents 
we have extensive policy and procedure manuals and hold frequent training sessions for management and staff at each site 
quality assurance we maintain quality assurance programs at each of our communities through our corporate and regional staff 
our quality assurance program is designed to achieve a high degree of resident and family member satisfaction with the care and services that we provide 
our quality control measures include  among other things  community inspections conducted by corporate staff on a regular basis 
these inspections cover the appearance of the exterior and grounds  the appearance and cleanliness of the interior  the professionalism and friendliness of staff  quality of resident care including assisted living services  nursing care  therapy and home health programs  the quality of activities and the dining program  observance of residents in their daily living activities  and compliance with government regulations 
our quality control measures also include the survey of residents and family members on a regular basis to monitor their perception of the quality of services provided to residents 
in order to foster a sense of community as well as to respond to residents desires  at many of our communities  we have established a resident council or other resident advisory committee that meets monthly with the executive director of the community 
separate resident committees also exist at many of these communities for food service  activities  marketing and hospitality 
these committees promote resident involvement and satisfaction and enable community management to be more responsive to the residents needs and desires 
marketing and sales our marketing strategy is intended to create awareness of us  our communities  our products and our services among potential residents and their family members and among referral sources  including hospital discharge planners  physicians  clergy  area agencies for the elderly  skilled nursing facilities  home health agencies and social workers 
our marketing staff develops overall strategies for promoting our communities and monitors the success of our marketing efforts  including outreach programs 
in addition to direct contacts with prospective referral sources  we also rely on internet inquiries  print advertising  yellow pages advertising  direct mail  signage and special events  health fairs and community receptions 
certain resident referral programs have been established and promoted within the limitations of federal and state laws at many communities 

table of contents in order to mitigate the impact of weakness in the housing market  we have implemented several sales and marketing initiatives designed to increase our entrance fee sales results 
these include the acceptance of short term promissory notes in satisfaction of a resident s required entrance fee from certain pre qualified  prospective residents who are waiting for their homes to sell 
in addition  we have implemented the mychoice program  which allows new and existing residents in certain communities the option to pay additional refundable entrance fee amounts in return for a reduced monthly service fee  thereby offering choices to residents desiring a more affordable ongoing monthly service fee 
competition the senior living industry is highly competitive 
we compete with numerous other organizations that provide similar senior living alternatives  such as home health care agencies  community based service programs  retirement communities  convalescent centers and other senior living providers 
in general  regulatory and other barriers to competitive entry in the retirement center and assisted living sectors of the senior living industry are not substantial  except in the skilled nursing area 
although new construction of senior living communities has declined in recent years  we have experienced and expect to continue to experience competition in our efforts to acquire and operate senior living communities 
some of our present and potential senior living competitors have  or may obtain  greater financial resources than us and may have a lower cost of capital 
consequently  we may encounter competition that could limit our ability to attract residents or expand our business  which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and earnings 
our major publicly traded competitors which operate senior living communities are sunrise senior living  inc  emeritus corporation and capital senior living corporation and our major private competitors include life care services  llc and atria senior living group  as well as a large number of not for profit entities 
partially as a result of recent tax law changes enacted through the real estate investment trusts reit investment diversification and empowerment act ridea  we now compete more directly with the various publicly traded healthcare reits for the acquisition of senior housing properties 
the largest four of these publicly traded healthcare reits measured on equity market capitalization include hcp  inc  ventas  inc  health care reit  inc 
and nationwide health properties  inc customers our target retirement center residents are senior citizens age and older who desire or need a more supportive living environment 
the average retirement center resident resides in a retirement center community for approximately months 
a number of our retirement center residents relocate to one of our communities in order to be in a metropolitan area that is closer to their adult children 
our target assisted living residents are predominantly senior citizens age and older who require daily assistance with two or three adls 
the average assisted living resident resides in an assisted living community for approximately months 
residents typically enter an assisted living community due to a relatively immediate need for services that might have been triggered by a medical event or need 
our target ccrc residents are senior citizens who are seeking a community that offers a variety of services and a continuum of care so that they can age in place 
these residents generally first enter the community as a resident of an independent living unit and may later move into an assisted living or skilled nursing unit as their needs change 
we believe our combination of retirement center and assisted living operating expertise and the broad base of customers that this enables us to target creates a unique opportunity for us to invest in a broad spectrum of assets in the senior living industry  including retirement center  assisted living  ccrc and skilled nursing communities 
employees as of december   we had approximately  full time employees and approximately  part time employees  of which work in our nashville headquarters office  work in our milwaukee office  work in our chicago office and work in a variety of field based management positions 
we currently consider our relationship with our employees to be good 

table of contents government regulation the regulatory environment surrounding the senior living industry continues to intensify in the number and type of laws and regulations affecting it 
in addition  federal  state and local officials are increasingly focusing their efforts on enforcement of these laws and regulations 
this is particularly true for large for profit  multi community providers like us 
some of the laws and regulations that impact our industry include state and local laws impacting licensure  protecting consumers against deceptive practices  and generally affecting the communities management of property and equipment and how we otherwise conduct our operations  such as fire  health and safety laws and regulations and privacy laws  federal and state laws designed to protect medicare and medicaid  which mandate what are allowable costs  pricing  quality of services  quality of care  food service  resident rights including abuse and neglect and fraud  federal and state residents rights statutes and regulations  anti kickback and physicians referral stark laws  and safety and health standards set by the occupational safety and health administration 
we are unable to predict the future course of federal  state and local legislation or regulation 
changes in the regulatory framework could have a material adverse effect on our business 
many senior living communities are also subject to regulation and licensing by state and local health and social service agencies and other regulatory authorities 
although requirements vary from state to state  these requirements may address  among others  the following personnel education  training and records  community services  including administration of medication  assistance with self administration of medication and the provision of nursing  home health and therapy services  staffing levels  monitoring of resident wellness  physical plant specifications  furnishing of resident units  food and housekeeping services  emergency evacuation plans  professional licensing and certification of staff prior to beginning employment  and resident rights and responsibilities  including in some states the right to receive health care services from providers of a resident s choice that are not our employees 
in several of the states in which we operate or may operate  we are prohibited from providing certain higher levels of senior care services without first obtaining the appropriate licenses 
in addition  in several of the states in which we operate or intend to operate  assisted living communities  home health agencies and or skilled nursing facilities require a certificate of need before the community can be opened or the services at an existing community can be expanded 
senior living communities may also be subject to state and or local building  zoning  fire and food service codes and must be in compliance with these local codes before licensing or certification may be granted 
these laws and regulatory requirements could affect our ability to expand into new markets and to expand our services and communities in existing markets 
in addition  if any of our presently licensed communities operates outside of its licensing authority  it may be subject to penalties  including closure of the community 
the intensified regulatory and enforcement environment impacts providers like us because of the increase in the number of inspections or surveys by governmental authorities and consequent citations for failure to comply with regulatory requirements 
unannounced surveys or inspections may occur annually or bi annually  or following a regulator s receipt of a complaint about the community 
from time to time in the ordinary course of business  we receive deficiency reports from state regulatory bodies resulting from such inspections or surveys 
most inspection deficiencies are resolved through an agreed to plan of corrective action relating to the community s operations  but the reviewing agency typically has the authority to take further action against a licensed or certified community  which could result in the imposition of fines  imposition of a provisional or conditional license  suspension or revocation of a license  suspension or denial of admissions  loss of certification as a provider under federal health care programs or imposition of other sanctions  including criminal penalties 
loss  suspension or modification of a license may also cause us to default under our loan or lease agreements and or trigger cross defaults 
sanctions may be taken against providers or facilities without regard to the providers or facilities history of compliance 
we may also expend considerable resources to respond to federal and state investigations or other enforcement action under applicable laws or regulations 
to date  none of the deficiency reports received by us has resulted in a suspension  fine or other disposition that has had a material adverse effect on our revenues 
however  any future substantial failure to comply with any applicable legal and regulatory requirements could result in a material adverse effect to our business as a whole 
in addition  states attorneys general vigorously enforce consumer protection laws as those laws relate to the senior living industry 
state medicaid fraud and abuse units may also investigate assisted living communities even if the community or any of its residents do not receive federal or state funds 
regulation of the senior living industry is evolving at least partly because of the growing interests of a variety of advocacy organizations and political movements attempting to standardize regulations for certain segments of the industry  particularly assisted living 
our operations could suffer if future regulatory developments  such as 
table of contents federal assisted living laws and regulations  as well as mandatory increases in the scope and severity of deficiencies determined by survey or inspection officials or increase the number of citations that can result in civil or criminal penalties 
certain current state laws and regulations allow enforcement officials to make determinations on whether the care provided by one or more of our communities exceeds the level of care for which the community is licensed 
a finding that a community is delivering care beyond its license might result in the immediate transfer and discharge of residents  which may create market instability and other adverse consequences 
furthermore  certain states may allow citations in one community to impact other communities in the state 
revocation or suspension of a license  or a citation  at a given community could therefore impact our ability to obtain new licenses or to renew existing licenses at other communities  which may also cause us to be in default under our loan or lease agreements and trigger cross defaults or may also trigger defaults under certain of our credit agreements  or adversely affect our ability to operate and or obtain financing in the future 
if a state were to find that one community s citation will impact another of our communities  this will also increase costs and result in increased surveillance by the state survey agency 
if regulatory requirements increase  whether through enactment of new laws or regulations or changes in the enforcement of existing rules  including increased enforcement brought about by advocacy groups  in addition to federal and state regulators  our operations could be adversely affected 
in addition  any adverse finding by survey and inspection officials may serve as the basis for false claims lawsuits by private plaintiffs and may lead to investigations under federal and state laws  which may result in civil and or criminal penalties against the community or individual 
there are various extremely complex federal and state laws governing a wide array of referrals  relationships and arrangements and prohibiting fraud by health care providers  including those in the senior living industry  and governmental agencies are devoting increasing attention and resources to such anti fraud initiatives 
the health insurance portability and accountability act of  or hipaa  and the balanced budget act of expanded the penalties for health care fraud 
in addition  with respect to our participation in federal health care reimbursement programs  the government or private individuals acting on behalf of the government may bring an action under the false claims act alleging that a health care provider has defrauded the government and seek treble damages for false claims and the payment of additional monetary civil penalties 
recently  other health care providers have faced enforcement action under the false claims act 
the false claims act allows a private individual with knowledge of fraud to bring a claim on behalf of the federal government and earn a percentage of the federal government s recovery 
because of these incentives  so called whistleblower suits have become more frequent 
also  if any of our communities exceeds its level of care  we may be subject to private lawsuits alleging transfer trauma by residents 
such allegations could also lead to investigations by enforcement officials  which could result in penalties  including the closure of communities 
the violation of any of these regulations may result in the imposition of fines or other penalties that could jeopardize our business 
additionally  we operate communities that participate in federal and or state health care reimbursement programs  including state medicaid waiver programs for assisted living communities  the medicare skilled nursing facility benefit program and other healthcare programs such as therapy and home health services  or other federal and or state health care programs 
consequently  we are subject to federal and state laws that prohibit anyone from presenting  or causing to be presented  claims for reimbursement which are false  fraudulent or are for items or services that were not provided as claimed 
similar state laws vary from state to state and we cannot be sure that these laws will be interpreted consistently or in keeping with past practices 
violation of any of these laws can result in loss of licensure  claims for recoupment  civil or criminal penalties and exclusion of health care providers or suppliers from furnishing covered items or services to beneficiaries of the applicable federal and or state health care reimbursement program 
loss of licensure may also cause us to default under our leases and loan agreements and or trigger cross defaults 
we are also subject to certain federal and state laws that regulate financial arrangements by health care providers  such as the federal anti kickback law  the stark laws and certain state referral laws 
the federal anti kickback law makes it unlawful for any person to offer or pay or to solicit or receive any remuneration 
directly or indirectly  overtly or covertly  in cash or in kind for referring or recommending for purchase any item or service which is eligible for payment under the medicare and or medicaid programs 
authorities have interpreted this statute very broadly to apply to many practices and relationships between health care providers and sources of patient referral 
if we were to violate the federal anti kickback law  we may face criminal penalties and civil sanctions  including fines and possible exclusion from government programs such as medicare and medicaid  which may also cause us to default under our leases and loan agreements and or trigger cross defaults 
adverse consequences may also result if we violate federal stark laws related to certain medicare and medicaid physician referrals 
while we endeavor to comply with all laws that regulate the licensure and operation of our senior living 
table of contents communities  it is difficult to predict how our revenues could be affected if we were subject to an action alleging such violations 
we are also subject to federal and state laws designed to protect the confidentiality of patient health information 
the us department of health and human services  or hhs  has issued rules pursuant to hipaa relating to the privacy of such information 
rules that became effective april  govern our use and disclosure of health information at certain hipaa covered communities 
we established procedures to comply with hipaa privacy requirements at these communities 
we were required to be in compliance with the hipaa rule establishing administrative  physical and technical security standards for health information by april to the best of our knowledge  we are in compliance with these rules 
environmental matters under various federal  state and local environmental laws  a current or previous owner or operator of real property  such as us  may be held liable in certain circumstances for the costs of investigation  removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances  including  among others  petroleum and materials containing asbestos  that could be located on  in  at or under a property  regardless of how such materials came to be located there 
additionally  such an owner or operator of real property may incur costs relating to the release of hazardous or toxic substances  including government fines and payments for personal injuries or damage to adjacent property 
the cost of any required investigation  remediation  removal  mitigation  compliance  fines or personal or property damages and our liability therefore could exceed the property s value and or our assets value 
in addition  the presence of such substances  or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate the damage caused by such substances  may adversely affect our ability to sell such property  to attract additional residents and retain existing residents  to borrow using such property as collateral or to develop or redevelop such property 
in addition  such laws impose liability for investigation  remediation  removal and mitigation costs on persons who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances at third party sites 
such laws and regulations often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the presence  release or disposal of such substances as well as without regard to whether such release or disposal was in compliance with law at the time it occurred 
moreover  the imposition of such liability upon us could be joint and several  which means we could be required to pay for the cost of cleaning up contamination caused by others who have become insolvent or otherwise judgment proof 
we do not believe that we have incurred such liabilities that would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our operations are subject to regulation under various federal  state and local environmental laws  including those relating to the handling  storage  transportation  treatment and disposal of medical waste products generated at our communities  identification and warning of the presence of asbestos containing materials in buildings  as well as removal of such materials  the presence of other substances in the indoor environment  and protection of the environment and natural resources in connection with development or construction of our properties 
some of our communities generate infectious or other hazardous medical waste due to the illness or physical condition of the residents  including  for example  blood contaminated bandages  swabs and other medical waste products and incontinence products of those residents diagnosed with an infectious disease 
the management of infectious medical waste  including its handling  storage  transportation  treatment and disposal  is subject to regulation under various federal  state and local environmental laws 
these environmental laws set forth the management requirements for such waste  as well as related permit  record keeping  notice and reporting obligations 
each of our communities has an agreement with a waste management company for the proper disposal of all infectious medical waste 
the use of such waste management companies does not immunize us from alleged violations of such medical waste laws for operations for which we are responsible even if carried out by such waste management companies  nor does it immunize us from third party claims for the cost to cleanup disposal sites at which such wastes have been disposed 
any finding that we are not in compliance with environmental laws could adversely affect our business operations and financial condition 
federal regulations require building owners and those exercising control over a building s management to identify and warn  via signs and labels  their employees and certain other employers operating in the building of potential hazards posed by workplace exposure to installed asbestos containing materials and potential asbestos containing materials in their buildings 
the regulations also set forth employee training  record keeping requirements and sampling protocols pertaining to asbestos containing materials and potential asbestos containing materials 
significant fines can be assessed for violation of these regulations 
building owners and 
table of contents those exercising control over a building s management may be subject to an increased risk of personal injury lawsuits by workers and others exposed to asbestos containing materials and potential asbestos containing materials 
the regulations may affect the value of a building containing asbestos containing materials and potential asbestos containing materials in which we have invested 
federal  state and local laws and regulations also govern the removal  encapsulation  disturbance  handling and or disposal of asbestos containing materials and potential asbestos containing materials when such materials are in poor condition or in the event of construction  remodeling  renovation or demolition of a building 
such laws may impose liability for improper handling or a release to the environment of asbestos containing materials and potential asbestos containing materials and may provide for fines to  and for third parties to seek recovery from  owners or operators of real properties for personal injury or improper work exposure associated with asbestos containing materials and potential asbestos containing materials 
the presence of mold  lead based paint  contaminants in drinking water  radon and or other substances at any of the communities we own or may acquire may lead to the incurrence of costs for remediation  mitigation or the implementation of an operations and maintenance plan 
furthermore  the presence of mold  lead based paint  contaminants in drinking water  radon and or other substances at any of the communities we own or may acquire may present a risk that third parties will seek recovery from the owners  operators or tenants of such properties for personal injury or property damage 
in some circumstances  areas affected by mold may be unusable for periods of time for repairs  and even after successful remediation  the known prior presence of extensive mold could adversely affect the ability of a community to retain or attract residents and could adversely affect a community s market value 
we believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws 
we are unable to predict the future course of federal  state and local environmental regulation and legislation 
changes in the environmental regulatory framework including legislative or regulatory efforts designed to address climate change  such as the proposed cap and trade legislation could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  because environmental laws vary from state to state  expansion of our operations to states where we do not currently operate may subject us to additional restrictions on the manner in which we operate our communities

risk factors 
risks related to our business recent disruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain financing or to extend or refinance debt as it matures  which could negatively impact our liquidity  financial condition and the market price of our common stock 
the united states stock and credit markets have recently experienced significant price volatility  dislocations and liquidity disruptions  which have caused market prices of many stocks to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably 
these circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in 
table of contents the financial markets  making terms for certain financings less attractive  and in some cases have resulted in the unavailability of financing 
continued uncertainty in the stock and credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional financing including any refinancing or extension of our existing debt on reasonable terms  which may negatively affect our business 
as of december   we had an available secured line of credit with a million commitment and separate letter of credit facilities of up to million in the aggregate 
as of february   we have an available secured line of credit with a million commitment and separate letter of credit facilities of up to million in the aggregate 
as of december   we also had million of debt that is scheduled to mature during the twelve months ending december  if we are unable to extend or refinance  as applicable any of our debt or credit or letter of credit facilities prior to their scheduled maturity dates  our liquidity and financial condition could be adversely impacted 
in addition  even if we are able to extend or refinance our other maturing debt or credit or letter of credit facilities  the terms of the new financing may not be as favorable to us as the terms of the existing financing 
a prolonged downturn in the financial markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing  and may require us to further adjust our business plan accordingly 
these events also may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital  including through the issuance of common stock 
continued disruptions in the financial markets could have an adverse effect on us and our business 
if we are not able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms  we also may have to delay or abandon some or all of our growth strategies  which could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
we will rely on reimbursement from governmental programs for a greater portion of our revenues than in the past  and will be subject to changes in reimbursement levels  which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow 
we will rely on reimbursement from governmental programs for a greater portion of our revenues than before  and we cannot assure you that reimbursement levels will not decrease in the future  which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow 
certain per person annual limits on medicare reimbursement for therapy services became effective in  subject to certain exceptions 
these exceptions are currently scheduled to expire on december  if these exceptions are modified or not extended beyond that date  our revenues and net operating income relating to our outpatient therapy services could be materially adversely impacted 
in addition  there continue to be various federal and state legislative and regulatory proposals to implement cost containment measures that would limit payments to healthcare providers in the future 
for example  the centers for medicare medicaid services cms recently published a decrease in home health rates for changes in the reimbursement policies of the medicare program could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow 
due to the dependency of our revenues on private pay sources  events which adversely affect the ability of seniors to afford our monthly resident fees or entrance fees including downturns in the economy  housing market  consumer confidence or the equity markets and unemployment among resident family members could cause our occupancy rates  revenues and results of operations to decline 
costs to seniors associated with independent and assisted living services are not generally reimbursable under government reimbursement programs such as medicare and medicaid 
only seniors with income or assets meeting or exceeding the comparable median in the regions where our communities are located typically can afford to pay our monthly resident fees 
economic downturns  softness in the housing market  higher levels of unemployment among resident family members  lower levels of consumer confidence  stock market volatility and or changes in demographics could adversely affect the ability of seniors to afford our resident fees or entrance fees 
if we are unable to retain and or attract seniors with sufficient income  assets or other resources required to pay the fees associated with independent and assisted living services and other service offerings  our occupancy rates  revenues and results of operations could decline 

table of contents the inability of seniors to sell real estate may delay their moving into our communities  which could negatively impact our occupancy rates  revenues  cash flows and results of operations 
recent housing price declines and reduced home mortgage availability have negatively affected the us housing market  with certain geographic areas experiencing more acute deterioration than others 
downturns in the housing markets  such as the one we have recently experienced  could adversely affect the ability or perceived ability of seniors to afford our entrance fees and resident fees as our customers frequently use the proceeds from the sale of their homes to cover the cost of our fees 
specifically  if seniors have a difficult time selling their homes  these difficulties could impact their ability to relocate into our communities or finance their stays at our communities with private resources 
if the recent volatility in the housing market continues for a protracted period  our occupancy rates  revenues  cash flows and results of operations could be negatively impacted 
general economic factors could adversely affect our financial performance and other aspects of our business 
general economic conditions  such as inflation  commodity costs  fuel and other energy costs  costs of labor  insurance and healthcare  interest rates  and tax rates  affect our community operating and general and administrative expenses  and we have no control or limited ability to control such factors 
in addition  current global economic conditions and uncertainties  the potential impact of a prolonged recession  the potential for failures or realignments of financial institutions  and the related impact on available credit may affect us and our business partners  landlords  counterparties and residents or prospective residents in an adverse manner including  but not limited to  reducing access to liquid funds or credit  increasing the cost of credit  limiting our ability to manage interest rate risk  increasing the risk that certain of our business partners  landlords or counterparties would be unable to fulfill their obligations to us  and other impacts which we are unable to fully anticipate 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to cover required interest and lease payments  this would result in defaults of the related debt or leases and cross defaults under other debt or leases  which would adversely affect our ability to continue to generate income 
we have significant indebtedness and lease obligations  and we intend to continue financing our communities through mortgage financing  long term leases and other types of financing  including borrowings under our line of credit and future credit facilities we may obtain 
we cannot give any assurance that we will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to cover required interest  principal and lease payments 
any non payment or other default under our financing arrangements could  subject to cure provisions  cause the lender to foreclose upon the community or communities securing such indebtedness or  in the case of a lease  cause the lessor to terminate the lease  each with a consequent loss of income and asset value to us 
furthermore  in some cases  indebtedness is secured by both a mortgage on a community or communities and a guaranty by us and or one or more of our subsidiaries 
in the event of a default under one of these scenarios  the lender could avoid judicial procedures required to foreclose on real property by declaring all amounts outstanding under the guaranty immediately due and payable  and requiring the respective guarantor to fulfill its obligations to make such payments 
the realization of any of these scenarios would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and capital structure 
additionally  a foreclosure on any of our properties could cause us to recognize taxable income  even if we did not receive any cash proceeds in connection with such foreclosure 
further  because our mortgages and leases generally contain cross default and cross collateralization provisions  a default by us related to one community could affect a significant number of our communities and their corresponding financing arrangements and leases 
our indebtedness and long term leases could adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to operate our business and our ability to execute our growth strategy 
our level of indebtedness and our long term leases could adversely affect our future operations and or impact our stockholders for several reasons  including  without limitation we may have little or no cash flow apart from cash flow that is dedicated to the payment of any interest  principal or amortization required with respect to outstanding indebtedness and lease payments with respect to our long term leases  increases in our outstanding indebtedness  leverage and long term leases will increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions  as well as to competitive pressure  
table of contents increases in our outstanding indebtedness may limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  expansions  new developments  acquisitions  general corporate and other purposes  and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders may be limited 
our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness and to make lease payments on our leases depends upon our future performance  which will be subject to general economic conditions  industry cycles and financial  business and other factors affecting our operations  many of which are beyond our control 
our business might not continue to generate cash flow at or above current levels 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt or to make lease payments on our leases  we may be required  among other things  to seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets  refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness  sell selected assets  reduce or delay planned capital expenditures or delay or abandon desirable acquisitions 
such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt or to make lease payments on our leases 
the failure to make required payments on our debt or leases or the delay or abandonment of our planned growth strategy could result in an adverse effect on our future ability to generate revenues and sustain profitability 
any such financing  refinancing or sale of assets might not be available on economically favorable terms to us 
in addition  certain of our debt agreements contain extension options 
if we are not able to satisfy the conditions precedent to exercising these extension options  our liquidity and financial condition could be negatively impacted 
our existing credit facilities  mortgage loans and lease arrangements contain covenants that restrict our operations and any default under such facilities  loans or arrangements could result in the acceleration of indebtedness  termination of the leases or cross defaults  any of which would negatively impact our liquidity and inhibit our ability to grow our business and increase revenues 
our outstanding indebtedness and leases contain restrictions and covenants and require us to maintain or satisfy specified financial ratios and coverage tests  including maintaining prescribed net worth levels  leverage ratios and debt service and lease coverage ratios on a consolidated basis  and on a community or communities basis based on the debt or lease securing the communities 
in addition  certain of our leases require us to maintain lease coverage ratios on a lease portfolio basis each as defined in the leases and maintain stockholders equity or tangible net worth amounts 
the debt service coverage ratios are generally calculated as revenues less operating expenses  including an implied management fee and a reserve for capital expenditures  divided by the debt principal and interest or lease payment 
net worth is generally calculated as stockholders equity as calculated in accordance with gaap  and in certain circumstances  reduced by intangible assets or liabilities or increased by deferred gains from sale leaseback transactions and deferred entrance fee revenue 
these restrictions and covenants may interfere with our ability to obtain financing or to engage in other business activities  which may inhibit our ability to grow our business and increase revenues 
if we fail to comply with any of these requirements  then the related indebtedness could become immediately due and payable 
we cannot assure you that we could pay this debt if it became due 
our outstanding indebtedness and leases are secured by our communities and  in certain cases  a guaranty by us and or one or more of our subsidiaries 
therefore  an event of default under the outstanding indebtedness or leases  subject to cure provisions in certain instances  would give the respective lenders or lessors  as applicable  the right to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable  terminate the lease  foreclose on collateral securing the outstanding indebtedness and leases  and restrict our ability to make additional borrowings under the outstanding indebtedness or continue to operate the properties subject to the lease 
certain of our outstanding indebtedness and leases contain cross default provisions so that a default under certain outstanding indebtedness would cause a default under certain of our leases 
certain of our outstanding indebtedness and leases also restrict  among other things  our ability to incur additional debt 
the substantial majority of our lease arrangements are structured as master leases 
under a master lease  we may lease a large number of geographically dispersed properties through an indivisible lease 
as a result  it is difficult to restructure the composition of the portfolio or economic terms of the lease without the consent of the landlord 
failure to comply with medicare or medicaid provider requirements is a default under several of our master lease and debt financing instruments 
in addition  potential defaults related to an individual property may cause a default of an entire master lease portfolio and could trigger cross default provisions in our outstanding 
table of contents indebtedness and other leases  which would have a negative impact on our capital structure and our ability to generate future revenues  and could interfere with our ability to pursue our growth strategy 
certain of our master leases also contain radius restrictions  which limit our ability to own  develop or acquire new communities within a specified distance from certain existing communities covered by such master leases 
these radius restrictions could negatively affect our expansion  development and acquisition plans 
mortgage debt and lease obligations expose us to increased risk of loss of property  which could harm our ability to generate future revenues and could have an adverse tax effect 
mortgage debt and lease obligations increase our risk of loss because defaults on indebtedness secured by properties or pursuant to the terms of the lease may result in foreclosure actions initiated by lenders or lessors and ultimately our loss of the property securing any loans for which we are in default or cause the lessor to terminate the lease 
for tax purposes  a foreclosure of any of our properties would be treated as a sale of the property for a purchase price equal to the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage 
if the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage exceeds our tax basis in the property  we would recognize taxable income on foreclosure  but would not receive any cash proceeds  which could negatively impact our earnings and liquidity 
further  our mortgage debt and leases generally contain cross default and cross collateralization provisions and a default on one community could affect a significant number of our communities  financing arrangements and leases 
in addition  our leases generally provide for renewal or extension options and  in certain cases  purchase options 
these options generally are based upon prescribed formulas but  in certain cases  may be at fair market value 
we expect to renew  extend or exercise purchase options with respect to our leases in the normal course of business  however  there can be no assurance that these rights will be exercised in the future or that we will be able to satisfy the conditions precedent to exercising any such renewal  extension or purchase options 
furthermore  the terms of any such options that are based on fair market value are inherently uncertain and could be unacceptable or unfavorable to us depending on the circumstances at the time of exercise 
if we are not able to renew or extend our existing leases  or purchase the communities subject to such leases  at or prior to the end of the existing lease terms  or if the terms of such options are unfavorable or unacceptable to us  our business  financial condition and results of operation could be adversely affected 
increases in market interest rates could significantly increase the costs of our unhedged debt and lease obligations  which could adversely affect our liquidity and earnings 
our unhedged floating rate debt and lease payment obligations and any unhedged floating rate debt incurred in the future  exposes us to interest rate risk 
therefore  increases in prevailing interest rates could increase our payment obligations  which would negatively impact our liquidity and earnings 
changes in the value of our interest rate swaps could require us to post additional cash collateral with our counterparties  which could negatively impact our liquidity and financial condition 
in the normal course of our business  we use a variety of financial instruments to manage or hedge interest rate risk 
we have entered into certain interest rate protection and swap agreements to effectively cap or convert floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis  as well as to hedge anticipated future financing transactions 
pursuant to certain of our hedge agreements  we are required to secure our obligation to our counterparty if the fair value liability exceeds a specified threshold by posting cash or other collateral 
in periods of significant volatility in the credit markets  the value of our swaps can change significantly and  as a result  the amount of collateral we are required to post can change significantly 
if we are required to post additional collateral due to changes in the fair value liability of our existing or future swaps  our liquidity and financial condition could be negatively impacted 
we also are exposed to the risk that our counterparties to our hedge agreements will default on their obligations 
we manage our exposure to this risk by limiting the counterparties to major international banks and financial institutions meeting established guidelines 
however  any default by such counterparties may have an adverse effect on us 
we have a history of losses and we may not be able to achieve profitability 
we have incurred net losses in every quarter since our formation in june given our history of losses  there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve and or maintain profitability in the future 
if we do not effectively manage our cash flow and combined business operations going forward or otherwise achieve profitability  our stock price would be adversely affected 
if we do not effectively manage our growth and successfully integrate new or recently acquired or initiated operations into our existing operations  our business and financial results could be adversely affected 
our growth has and will continue to place significant demands on our current management resources 
our ability to manage our growth effectively and to successfully integrate new or recently acquired or initiated operations including expansions  developments  acquisitions and the expansion of our ancillary services program into our existing business will require us to continue to expand our operational  financial and management information 
table of contents systems and to continue to retain  attract  train  motivate and manage key employees 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting qualified individuals to the extent necessary  and management may expend significant time and energy attracting the appropriate personnel to manage assets we purchase in the future and our expansion and development activities 
also  the additional communities and expansion activities will require us to maintain consistent quality control measures that allow our management to effectively identify deviations that result in delivering care and services that are substandard  which may result in litigation and or loss of licensure or certification 
if we are unable to manage our growth effectively  successfully integrate new or recently acquired or initiated operations into our existing business  or maintain consistent quality control measures  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
delays in obtaining regulatory approvals could hinder our plans to expand our ancillary services program  which could negatively impact our anticipated revenues  results of operations and cash flows 
we plan to continue to expand our offering of ancillary services including therapy  home health and hospice to additional communities 
in the current environment  it is difficult to obtain certain required regulatory approvals 
delays in obtaining required regulatory approvals could impede our ability to expand to additional communities in accordance with our plans  which could negatively impact our anticipated revenues  results of operations and cash flows 
if we are unable to expand our communities in accordance with our plans  our anticipated revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected 
we are currently working on projects that will expand a number of our existing senior living communities over the next several years 
these projects are in various stages of development and are subject to a number of factors over which we have little or no control 
such factors include the necessity of arranging separate leases  mortgage loans or other financings to provide the capital required to complete these projects  difficulties or delays in obtaining zoning  land use  building  occupancy  licensing  certificate of need and other required governmental permits and approvals  failure to complete construction of the projects on budget and on schedule  failure of third party contractors and subcontractors to perform under their contracts  shortages of labor or materials that could delay projects or make them more expensive  adverse weather conditions that could delay completion of projects  increased costs resulting from general economic conditions or increases in the cost of materials  and increased costs as a result of changes in laws and regulations 
we cannot assure you that we will elect to undertake or complete all of our proposed expansion and development projects  or that we will not experience delays in completing those projects 
in addition  we may incur substantial costs prior to achieving stabilized occupancy for each such project and cannot assure you that these costs will not be greater than we have anticipated 
we also cannot assure you that any of our expansion or development projects will be economically successful 
our failure to achieve our expansion and development plans could adversely impact our growth objectives  and our anticipated revenues and results of operations 
we may encounter difficulties in acquiring communities at attractive prices or integrating acquisitions with our operations  which may adversely affect our operations and financial condition 
we will continue to selectively target strategic acquisitions as opportunities arise 
the process of integrating acquired communities into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties  divert managerial attention or require significant financial resources 
these acquisitions and other future acquisitions may require us to incur additional indebtedness and contingent liabilities  and may result in unforeseen expenses or compliance issues  which may limit our revenue growth  cash flows  and our ability to achieve profitability 
moreover  any future acquisitions may not generate any additional income for us or provide any benefit to our business 
in addition  we cannot assure you that we will be able to locate and acquire communities at attractive prices in locations that are compatible with our strategy or that competition for the acquisition of communities will not increase 
finally  when we are able to locate communities and enter into definitive agreements to acquire or lease them  we cannot assure you that the transactions will be completed 
failure to complete transactions after we have entered into definitive agreements may result in significant expenses to us 
unforeseen costs associated with the acquisition of communities could reduce our future profitability 
our growth strategy contemplates selected future acquisitions of existing senior living operating companies and communities 
despite our extensive underwriting and due diligence procedures  communities that we have 
table of contents previously acquired or may acquire in the future may generate unexpectedly low or no returns or may not meet a risk profile that our investors find acceptable 
in addition  we might encounter unanticipated difficulties and expenditures relating to any of the acquired communities  including contingent liabilities  or newly acquired communities might require significant management attention that would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business 
for example  a community may require capital expenditures in excess of budgeted amounts  or it may experience management turnover that is higher than we project 
these costs may negatively affect our future profitability 
competition for the acquisition of strategic assets from buyers with lower costs of capital than us or that have lower return expectations than we do could limit our ability to compete for strategic acquisitions and therefore to grow our business effectively 
several real estate investment trusts  or reits  have similar asset acquisition objectives as we do  along with greater financial resources and lower costs of capital than we are able to obtain 
this may increase competition for acquisitions that would be suitable to us  making it more difficult for us to compete and successfully implement our growth strategy 
there is significant competition among potential acquirers in the senior living industry  including reits  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement our growth strategy or complete acquisitions  which could limit our ability to grow our business effectively 
partially as a result of recent tax law changes enacted through ridea  we now compete more directly with the various publicly traded healthcare reits for the acquisition of senior housing properties 
we may need additional capital to fund our operations and finance our growth  and we may not be able to obtain it on terms acceptable to us  or at all  which may limit our ability to grow 
continued expansion of our business through the expansion  redevelopment and repositioning of our existing communities  the development of new communities and the acquisition of existing senior living operating companies and communities will require additional capital  particularly if we were to accelerate our expansion and acquisition plans 
financing may not be available to us or may be available to us only on terms that are not favorable 
in addition  certain of our outstanding indebtedness and long term leases restrict  among other things  our ability to incur additional debt 
if we are unable to raise additional funds or obtain them on terms acceptable to us  we may have to delay or abandon some or all of our growth strategies 
further  if additional funds are raised through the issuance of additional equity securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders would be diluted 
any newly issued equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock 
in addition  we are heavily dependent on mortgage financing provided by federal national mortgage association fannie mae and federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac collectively  the agency lenders 
the agency lenders are currently operating under a conservatorship begun in  conducting business under the direction of the federal housing finance agency 
reform efforts related to the agency lenders may make such financing sources less available or unavailable in the future and may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing 
there can be no assurance that such alternative sources will be available 
we are susceptible to risks associated with the lifecare benefits that we offer the residents of our lifecare entrance fee communities 
as of december   we operated lifecare entrance fee communities that offer residents a limited lifecare benefit 
residents of these communities pay an upfront entrance fee upon occupancy  of which a portion is generally refundable  with an additional monthly service fee while living in the community 
this limited lifecare benefit is typically a a certain number of free days in the community s health center during the resident s lifetime  b a discounted rate for such services  or c a combination of the two 
the lifecare benefit varies based upon the extent to which the resident s entrance fee is refundable 
the pricing of entrance fees  refundability provisions  monthly service fees  and lifecare benefits are determined utilizing actuarial projections of the expected morbidity and mortality of the resident population 
in the event the entrance fees and monthly service payments established for our communities are not sufficient to cover the cost of lifecare benefits granted to residents  the results of operations and financial condition of these communities could be adversely affected 

table of contents residents of these entrance fee communities are guaranteed a living unit and nursing care at the community during their lifetime  even if the resident exhausts his or her financial resources and becomes unable to satisfy his or her obligations to the community 
in addition  in the event a resident requires nursing care and there is insufficient capacity for the resident in the nursing facility at the community where the resident lives  the community must contract with a third party to provide such care 
although we screen potential residents to ensure that they have adequate assets  income  and reimbursements from government programs and third parties to pay their obligations to our communities during their lifetime  we cannot assure you that such assets  income  and reimbursements will be sufficient in all cases 
if insufficient  we have rights of set off against the refundable portions of the residents deposits  and would also seek available reimbursement under medicaid or other available programs 
to the extent that the financial resources of some of the residents are not sufficient to pay for the cost of facilities and services provided to them  or in the event that our communities must pay third parties to provide nursing care to residents of our communities  our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected 
the geographic concentration of our communities could leave us vulnerable to an economic downturn  regulatory changes or acts of nature in those areas  resulting in a decrease in our revenues or an increase in our costs  or otherwise negatively impacting our results of operations 
we have a high concentration of communities in various geographic areas  including the states of florida  texas  north carolina  california  colorado  ohio and arizona 
as a result of this concentration  the conditions of local economies and real estate markets  changes in governmental rules and regulations  particularly with respect to assisted living communities  acts of nature and other factors that may result in a decrease in demand for senior living services in these states could have an adverse effect on our revenues  costs and results of operations 
in addition  given the location of our communities  we are particularly susceptible to revenue loss  cost increase or damage caused by other severe weather conditions or natural disasters such as hurricanes  earthquakes or tornados 
any significant loss due to a natural disaster may not be covered by insurance and may lead to an increase in the cost of insurance 
termination of our resident agreements and vacancies in the living spaces we lease could adversely affect our revenues  earnings and occupancy levels 
state regulations governing assisted living communities require written resident agreements with each resident 
several of these regulations also require that each resident have the right to terminate the resident agreement for any reason on reasonable notice 
consistent with these regulations  many of our assisted living resident agreements allow residents to terminate their agreements upon to days notice 
unlike typical apartment leasing or independent living arrangements that involve lease agreements with specified leasing periods of up to a year or longer  in many instances we cannot contract with our assisted living residents to stay in those living spaces for longer periods of time 
our retirement center resident agreements generally provide for termination of the lease upon death or allow a resident to terminate his or her lease upon the need for a higher level of care not provided at the community 
if multiple residents terminate their resident agreements at or around the same time  our revenues  earnings and occupancy levels could be adversely affected 
in addition  because of the demographics of our typical residents  including age and health  resident turnover rates in our communities are difficult to predict 
as a result  the living spaces we lease may be unoccupied for a period of time  which could adversely affect our revenues and earnings 
increases in the cost and availability of labor  including increased competition for or a shortage of skilled personnel or increased union activity  would have an adverse effect on our profitability and or our ability to conduct our business operations 
our success depends on our ability to retain and attract skilled management personnel who are responsible for the day to day operations of each of our communities 
each community has an executive director responsible for the overall day to day operations of the community  including quality of care  social services and financial performance 
depending upon the size of the community  each executive director is supported by a community staff member who is directly responsible for day to day care of the residents and either community staff or regional support to oversee the community s marketing and community outreach programs 
other key positions supporting each community may include individuals responsible for food service  healthcare services  therapy services  activities  housekeeping and engineering 
we compete with various health care service providers  including other senior living providers  in retaining and attracting qualified and skilled personnel 
increased 
table of contents competition for or a shortage of nurses  therapists or other trained personnel  or general inflationary pressures may require that we enhance our pay and benefits package to compete effectively for such personnel 
we may not be able to offset such added costs by increasing the rates we charge to our residents or our service charges  which would negatively impact our results of operations 
turnover rates and the magnitude of the shortage of nurses  therapists or other trained personnel varies substantially from market to market 
although reliable industry wide data on key employee retention does not exist  we believe that our employee retention rates are consistent with those of other national senior housing operators 
if we fail to attract and retain qualified and skilled personnel  our ability to conduct our business operations effectively  our ability to implement our growth strategy  and our overall operating results could be harmed 
in addition  efforts by labor unions to unionize any of our community personnel could divert management attention  lead to increases in our labor costs and or reduce our flexibility with respect to certain workplace rules 
recently proposed legislation known as the employee free choice act  or card check  and or related regulatory proposals could make it significantly easier for union organizing drives to be successful  leading to increased organizational activity  and could give third party arbitrators the ability to impose terms of collective bargaining agreements upon us and a labor union if we and such union are unable to agree to the terms of a collective bargaining agreement 
if we experience an increase in organizing activity  if onerous collective bargaining agreement terms are imposed upon us  or if we otherwise experience an increase in our staffing and labor costs  our profitability and cash flows from operations would be negatively affected 
departure of our key officers could harm our business 
our future success depends  to a significant extent  upon the continued service of our senior management personnel  particularly we sheriff  our chief executive officer  mark w 
ohlendorf  our co president and chief financial officer  john p 
rijos  our co president and chief operating officer  and t 
andrew smith  our executive vice president  general counsel and secretary 
if we were to lose the services of any of these individuals  our business and financial results could be adversely affected 
environmental contamination at any of our communities could result in substantial liabilities to us  which may exceed the value of the underlying assets and which could materially and adversely effect our liquidity and earnings 
under various federal  state and local environmental laws  a current or previous owner or operator of real property  such as us  may be held liable in certain circumstances for the costs of investigation  removal or remediation of  or related to the release of  certain hazardous or toxic substances  that could be located on  in  at or under a property  regardless of how such materials came to be located there 
the cost of any required investigation  remediation  removal  mitigation  compliance  fines or personal or property damages and our liability therefore could exceed the property s value and or our assets value 
in addition  the presence of such substances  or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate the damage caused by such substances  may adversely affect our ability to sell such property  to attract additional residents and retain existing residents  to borrow using such property as collateral or to develop or redevelop such property 
in addition  such laws impose liability  which may be joint and several  for investigation  remediation  removal and mitigation costs on persons who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances at third party sites 
such laws and regulations often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the presence  release or disposal of such substances as well as without regard to whether such release or disposal was in compliance with law at the time it occurred 
although we do not believe that we have incurred such liabilities as would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations  we could be subject to substantial future liability for environmental contamination that we have no knowledge about as of the date of this report and or for which we may not be at fault 
failure to comply with existing environmental laws could result in increased expenditures  litigation and potential loss to our business and in our asset value  which would have an adverse effect on our earnings and financial condition 
our operations are subject to regulation under various federal  state and local environmental laws  including those relating to the handling  storage  transportation  treatment and disposal of medical waste products generated at our communities  identification and warning of the presence of asbestos containing materials in buildings  as well 
table of contents as removal of such materials  the presence of other substances in the indoor environment  and protection of the environment and natural resources in connection with development or construction of our properties 
some of our communities generate infectious or other hazardous medical waste due to the illness or physical condition of the residents 
each of our communities has an agreement with a waste management company for the proper disposal of all infectious medical waste  but the use of such waste management companies does not immunize us from alleged violations of such laws for operations for which we are responsible even if carried out by such waste management companies  nor does it immunize us from third party claims for the cost to cleanup disposal sites at which such wastes have been disposed 
federal regulations require building owners and those exercising control over a building s management to identify and warn their employees and certain other employers operating in the building of potential hazards posed by workplace exposure to installed asbestos containing materials and potential asbestos containing materials in their buildings 
significant fines can be assessed for violation of these regulations 
building owners and those exercising control over a building s management may be subject to an increased risk of personal injury lawsuits 
federal  state and local laws and regulations also govern the removal  encapsulation  disturbance  handling and or disposal of asbestos containing materials and potential asbestos containing materials when such materials are in poor condition or in the event of construction  remodeling  renovation or demolition of a building 
such laws may impose liability for improper handling or a release to the environment of asbestos containing materials and potential asbestos containing materials and may provide for fines to  and for third parties to seek recovery from  owners or operators of real properties for personal injury or improper work exposure associated with asbestos containing materials and potential asbestos containing materials 
the presence of mold  lead based paint  contaminants in drinking water  radon and or other substances at any of the communities we own or may acquire may lead to the incurrence of costs for remediation  mitigation or the implementation of an operations and maintenance plan and may result in third party litigation for personal injury or property damage 
furthermore  in some circumstances  areas affected by mold may be unusable for periods of time for repairs  and even after successful remediation  the known prior presence of extensive mold could adversely affect the ability of a community to retain or attract residents and could adversely affect a community s market value 
although we believe that we are currently in material compliance with applicable environmental laws  if we fail to comply with such laws in the future  we would face increased expenditures both in terms of fines and remediation of the underlying problem s  potential litigation relating to exposure to such materials  and potential decrease in value to our business and in the value of our underlying assets 
therefore  our failure to comply with existing environmental laws would have an adverse effect on our earnings  our financial condition and our ability to pursue our growth strategy 
we are unable to predict the future course of federal  state and local environmental regulation and legislation 
changes in the environmental regulatory framework including legislative or regulatory efforts designed to address climate change  such as the proposed cap and trade legislation could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  because environmental laws vary from state to state  expansion of our operations to states where we do not currently operate may subject us to additional restrictions on the manner in which we operate our communities 
we are subject to risks associated with complying with section of the sarbanes oxley act of we are subject to various regulatory requirements  including the sarbanes oxley act of under section of the sarbanes oxley act of  our management is required to include a report with each annual report on form k regarding our internal control over financial reporting 
we have implemented processes documenting and evaluating our system of internal controls 
complying with these requirements is expensive  time consuming and subject to changes in regulatory requirements 
the existence of one or more material weaknesses  management s conclusion that its internal control over financial reporting is not effective  or the inability of our auditors to express an opinion that our internal control over financial reporting is effective  could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports  adversely affect our stock price and or subject us to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities 

table of contents risks related to pending litigation complaints filed against us could  if adversely determined  subject us to a material loss 
we have been and are currently involved in litigation and claims incidental to the conduct of our business which are comparable to other companies in the senior living and healthcare industries 
certain claims and lawsuits allege large damage amounts and may require significant costs to defend and resolve 
similarly  the senior living and healthcare industries are continuously subject to scrutiny by governmental regulators  which could result in litigation related to regulatory compliance matters 
as a result  we maintain insurance policies in amounts and with coverage and deductibles we believe are adequate  based on the nature and risks of our business  historical experience and industry standards 
effective january  through december   our policies provided for deductibles of  for each claim on a claims made basis 
effective january   our current policies are also written on a claims made basis and provide for deductibles of  for each claim 
accordingly  we are  in effect  self insured for claims that are less than  if we experience a greater number of losses than we anticipate  or if certain claims are not ultimately covered by insurance  our results of operation and financial condition could be adversely affected 
risks related to our industry the cost and difficulty of complying with increasing and evolving regulation and enforcement could have an adverse effect on our business operations and profits 
the regulatory environment surrounding the senior living industry continues to evolve and intensify in the amount and type of laws and regulations affecting it  many of which vary from state to state 
in addition  many senior living communities are subject to regulation and licensing by state and local health and social service agencies and other regulatory authorities 
in several of the states in which we operate or may operate  we are prohibited from providing certain higher levels of senior care services without first obtaining the appropriate licenses 
also  in several of the states in which we operate or intend to operate  assisted living communities and or skilled nursing facilities require a certificate of need before the community can be opened or the services at an existing community can be expanded 
furthermore  federal  state and local officials are increasingly focusing their efforts on enforcement of these laws  particularly with respect to large for profit  multi community providers like us 
these requirements  and the increased enforcement thereof  could affect our ability to expand into new markets  to expand our services and communities in existing markets and  if any of our presently licensed communities were to operate outside of its licensing authority  may subject us to penalties including closure of the community 
future regulatory developments as well as mandatory increases in the scope and severity of deficiencies determined by survey or inspection officials could cause our operations to suffer 
we are unable to predict the future course of federal  state and local legislation or regulation 
if regulatory requirements increase  whether through enactment of new laws or regulations or changes in the enforcement of existing rules  our earnings and operations could be adversely affected 
the intensified regulatory and enforcement environment impacts providers like us because of the increase in the number of inspections or surveys by governmental authorities and consequent citations for failure to comply with regulatory requirements 
we also expend considerable resources to respond to federal and state investigations or other enforcement action 
from time to time in the ordinary course of business  we receive deficiency reports from state and federal regulatory bodies resulting from such inspections or surveys 
although most inspection deficiencies are resolved through an agreed to plan of corrective action  the reviewing agency typically has the authority to take further action against a licensed or certified facility  which could result in the imposition of fines  imposition of a provisional or conditional license  suspension or revocation of a license  suspension or denial of admissions  loss of certification as a provider under federal health care programs or imposition of other sanctions  including criminal penalties 
furthermore  certain states may allow citations in one community to impact other communities in the state 
revocation of a license at a given community could therefore impact our ability to obtain new licenses or to renew existing licenses at other communities  which may also cause us to be in default under our leases  trigger cross defaults  trigger defaults under certain of our credit agreements or adversely affect our ability to operate and or obtain financing in the future 
if a state were to find that one community s citation would impact another of our communities  this would also increase costs and result in increased surveillance by the state survey agency 
to date  none of the deficiency reports received by us has resulted in a suspension  fine or other disposition that has had a material adverse effect on our revenues 

table of contents however  the failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements in the future could result in a material adverse effect to our business as a whole 
there are various extremely complex federal and state laws governing a wide array of referral relationships and arrangements and prohibiting fraud by health care providers  including those in the senior living industry  and governmental agencies are devoting increasing attention and resources to such anti fraud initiatives 
some examples are the health insurance portability and accountability act of  or hipaa  the balanced budget act of  and the false claims act  which gives private individuals the ability to bring an action on behalf of the federal government 
the violation of any of these laws or regulations may result in the imposition of fines or other penalties that could increase our costs and otherwise jeopardize our business 
under the deficit reduction act of  or dra  every entity that receives at least million annually in medicaid payments must have established written policies for all employees  contractors or agents  providing detailed information about false claims  false statements and whistleblower protections under certain federal laws  including the federal false claims act  and similar state laws 
failure to comply with this new compliance requirement may potentially give rise to potential liability 
dra also creates an incentive for states to enact false claims laws that are comparable to the federal false claims act 
additionally  we provide services and operate communities that participate in federal and or state health care reimbursement programs  which makes us subject to federal and state laws that prohibit anyone from presenting  or causing to be presented  claims for reimbursement which are false  fraudulent or are for items or services that were not provided as claimed 
similar state laws vary from state to state and we cannot be sure that these laws will be interpreted consistently or in keeping with past practice 
violation of any of these laws can result in loss of licensure  civil or criminal penalties and exclusion of health care providers or suppliers from furnishing covered items or services to beneficiaries of the applicable federal and or state health care reimbursement program 
loss of licensure may also cause us to default under our leases and or trigger cross defaults 
we are also subject to certain federal and state laws that regulate financial arrangements by health care providers  such as the federal anti kickback law  the stark laws and certain state referral laws 
authorities have interpreted the federal anti kickback law very broadly to apply to many practices and relationships between health care providers and sources of patient referral 
this could result in criminal penalties and civil sanctions  including fines and possible exclusion from government programs such as medicare and medicaid  which may also cause us to default under our leases and or trigger cross defaults 
adverse consequences may also result if we violate federal stark laws related to certain medicare and medicaid physician referrals 
while we endeavor to comply with all laws that regulate the licensure and operation of our business  it is difficult to predict how our revenues could be affected if we were subject to an action alleging such violations 
compliance with the americans with disabilities act especially as recently amended  fair housing act and fire  safety and other regulations may require us to make unanticipated expenditures  which could increase our costs and therefore adversely affect our earnings and financial condition 
all of our communities are required to comply with the americans with disabilities act  or ada 
the ada has separate compliance requirements for public accommodations and commercial properties  but generally requires that buildings be made accessible to people with disabilities 
compliance with ada requirements could require removal of access barriers and non compliance could result in imposition of government fines or an award of damages to private litigants 
we must also comply with the fair housing act  which prohibits us from discriminating against individuals on certain bases in any of our practices if it would cause such individuals to face barriers in gaining residency in any of our communities 
additionally  the fair housing act and other state laws require that we advertise our services in such a way that we promote diversity and not limit it 
we may be required  among other things  to change our marketing techniques to comply with these requirements 
in addition  we are required to operate our communities in compliance with applicable fire and safety regulations  building codes and other land use regulations and food licensing or certification requirements as they may be adopted by governmental agencies and bodies from time to time 
like other health care facilities  senior living communities are subject to periodic survey or inspection by governmental authorities to assess and assure compliance with regulatory requirements 
surveys occur on a regular often annual or bi annual schedule  and 
table of contents special surveys may result from a specific complaint filed by a resident  a family member or one of our competitors 
we may be required to make substantial capital expenditures to comply with those requirements 
capital expenditures we have made to comply with any of the above to date have been immaterial  however  the increased costs and capital expenditures that we may incur in order to comply with any of the above would result in a negative effect on our earnings  and financial condition 
significant legal actions and liability claims against us in excess of insurance limits could subject us to increased operating costs and substantial uninsured liabilities  which may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 
the senior living and healthcare services businesses entails an inherent risk of liability  particularly given the demographics of our residents  including age and health  and the services we provide 
in recent years  we  as well as other participants in our industry  have been subject to an increasing number of claims and lawsuits alleging that our services have resulted in resident injury or other adverse effects 
many of these lawsuits involve large damage claims and significant legal costs 
many states continue to consider tort reform and how it will apply to the senior living industry 
we may continue to be faced with the threat of large jury verdicts in jurisdictions that do not find favor with large senior living or healthcare providers 
we maintain liability insurance policies in amounts and with the coverage and deductibles we believe are adequate based on the nature and risks of our business  historical experience and industry standards 
we have formed a wholly owned captive insurance company for the purpose of insuring certain portions of our risk retention under our general and professional liability insurance programs 
there can be no guarantee that we will not have any claims that exceed our policy limits in the future 
if a successful claim is made against us and it is not covered by our insurance or exceeds the policy limits  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
in some states  state law may prohibit or limit insurance coverage for the risk of punitive damages arising from professional liability and general liability claims and or litigation 
as a result  we may be liable for punitive damage awards in these states that either are not covered or are in excess of our insurance policy limits 
also  the above deductibles  or self insured retention  are accrued based on an actuarial projection of future liabilities 
if these projections are inaccurate and if there are an unexpectedly large number of successful claims that result in liabilities in excess of our self insured retention  our operating results could be negatively affected 
claims against us  regardless of their merit or eventual outcome  also could have a material adverse effect on our ability to attract residents or expand our business and could require our management to devote time to matters unrelated to the day to day operation of our business 
we also have to renew our policies every year and negotiate acceptable terms for coverage  exposing us to the volatility of the insurance markets  including the possibility of rate increases 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain liability insurance in the future or  if available  that such coverage will be available on acceptable terms 
overbuilding and increased competition may adversely affect our ability to generate and increase our revenues and profits and to pursue our business strategy 
the senior living industry is highly competitive  and we expect that it may become more competitive in the future 
we compete with numerous other companies that provide long term care alternatives such as home healthcare agencies  therapy services  life care at home  community based service programs  retirement communities  convalescent centers and other independent living  assisted living and skilled nursing providers  including not for profit entities 
in general  regulatory and other barriers to competitive entry in the independent living and assisted living sectors of the senior living industry are not substantial 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience increased competition in our efforts to acquire and operate senior living communities 
consequently  we may encounter increased competition that could limit our ability to attract new residents  raise resident fees or expand our business  which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and earnings 
in addition  overbuilding in the late s in the senior living industry reduced the occupancy rates of many newly constructed buildings and  in some cases  reduced the monthly rate that some newly built and previously existing communities were able to obtain for their services 
this resulted in lower revenues for certain of our communities during that time 
while we believe that overbuilt markets have stabilized and should continue to be stabilized for the immediate future  we cannot be certain that the effects of this period of overbuilding will not affect our occupancy and resident fee rate levels in the future  nor can we be certain that another period of 
table of contents overbuilding in the future will not have the same effects 
moreover  while we believe that the new construction dynamics and the competitive environments in the states in which we operate are substantially similar to the national market  taken as a whole  if the dynamics or environment were to be significantly adverse in one or more of those states  it would have a disproportionate effect on our revenues due to the large portion of our revenues that are generated in those states 
risks related to our organization and structure if the ownership of our common stock continues to be highly concentrated  it may prevent you and other stockholders from influencing significant corporate decisions and may result in conflicts of interest

fortress s interests  including its ownership of the north american operations of holiday retirement corp  one of our competitors  may conflict with your interests 
their effective control of and or substantial influence over the company could delay  deter or prevent acts that may be favored by our other stockholders such as hostile takeovers  changes in control of the company and changes in management 
as a result of such actions  the market price of our common stock could decline or stockholders might not receive a premium for their shares in connection with a change of control of the company 
anti takeover provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated by laws may discourage  delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that you may consider favorable or prevent the removal of our current board of directors and management 
certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated by laws may discourage  delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that you may consider favorable or prevent the removal of our current board of directors and management 
we have a number of anti takeover devices in place that will hinder takeover attempts  including a staggered board of directors consisting of three classes of directors  each of whom serve three year terms  removal of directors only for cause  and only with the affirmative vote of at least of the voting interest of stockholders entitled to vote  blank check preferred stock  provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by laws preventing stockholders from calling special meetings  advance notice requirements for stockholders with respect to director nominations and actions to be taken at annual meetings  and no provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation for cumulative voting in the election of directors  which means that the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock can elect all the directors standing for election 
additionally  our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that section of the delaware general corporation law  which restricts certain business combinations with interested stockholders in certain situations  will not apply to us 
this may make it easier for a third party to acquire an interest in some or all of us 
table of contents with fortress approval  even though our other stockholders may not deem such an acquisition beneficial to their interests 
we are a holding company with no operations and rely on our operating subsidiaries to provide us with funds necessary to meet our financial obligations 
we are a holding company with no material direct operations 
our principal assets are the equity interests we directly or indirectly hold in our operating subsidiaries

risks related to our common stock the market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile  which could result in rapid and substantial losses for our stockholders 
the market price of our common stock may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations 
in addition  the trading volume in our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur 
if the market price of our common stock declines significantly  you may be unable to resell your shares at or above your purchase price 
we cannot assure you that the market price of our common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future 
some of the factors that could negatively affect our share price or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our common stock include variations in our quarterly operating results  changes in our earnings estimates  the contents of published research reports about us or the senior living industry or the failure of securities analysts to cover our common stock  additions or departures of key management personnel  any increased indebtedness we may incur or lease obligations we may enter into in the future  actions by institutional stockholders  changes in market valuations of similar companies  announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts  acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  speculation or reports by the press or investment community with respect to the company or the senior living industry in general  increases in market interest rates that may lead purchasers of our shares to demand a higher yield  changes or proposed changes in laws or regulations affecting the senior living industry or enforcement of these laws and regulations  or announcements relating to these matters  and general market and economic conditions 
future offerings of debt or equity securities by us may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in the future  we may attempt to increase our capital resources by offering debt or additional equity securities  including commercial paper  medium term notes  senior or subordinated notes  series of preferred shares or shares of our common stock 
upon liquidation  holders of our debt securities and preferred stock  and lenders with respect to other borrowings  would receive a distribution of our available assets prior to the holders of our 
table of contents common stock 
additional equity offerings may dilute the economic and voting rights of our existing stockholders or reduce the market price of our common stock  or both 
shares of our preferred stock  if issued  could have a preference with respect to liquidating distributions or a preference with respect to dividend payments that could limit our ability to pay dividends to the holders of our common stock 
because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control  we cannot predict or estimate the amount  timing or nature of our future offerings 
thus  holders of our common stock bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting their share holdings in us 
we may issue all of the shares of our common stock that are authorized but unissued and not otherwise reserved for issuance under our stock incentive or purchase plans without any action or approval by our stockholders 
we intend to continue to pursue selected acquisitions of senior living communities and may issue shares of common stock in connection with these acquisitions 
any shares issued in connection with our acquisitions or otherwise would dilute the holdings of our current stockholders

all of the shares of our common stock are freely transferable  except for any shares held by our affiliates  as that term is defined in rule under the securities act of  as amended  or the securities act  or any shares otherwise subject to the limitations of rule pursuant to our stockholders agreement  fortress and certain of its affiliates and permitted third party transferees have the right  in certain circumstances  to require us to register their shares of our common stock under the securities act for sale into the public markets 
upon the effectiveness of such a registration statement  all shares covered by the registration statement will be freely transferable 
in connection with our obligations under the stockholders agreement  we received a request from fortress to file a registration statement on form s to permit the resale  from time to time  of up to  shares of common stock owned by certain affiliates of fortress 
the registration statement on form s was declared effective on may  and  shares owned by affiliates of fortress were sold pursuant to the registration statement in november in addition  an aggregate of  shares owned by affiliates and various principals of fortress were sold pursuant to the registration statement in may and november in addition  as of december   we had registered under the securities act an aggregate of  shares for issuance under our omnibus stock incentive plan  an aggregate of  shares for issuance under our associate stock purchase plan and an aggregate of  shares for issuance under our director stock purchase plan 
in accordance with the terms of the omnibus stock incentive plan  the number of shares available for issuance automatically increases by  shares on january of each year 
pursuant to the terms of the associate stock purchase plan  the number of shares available for purchase under the plan automatically increases by  shares on the first day of each calendar year beginning january  subject to any restrictions imposed on the shares and options granted under our stock incentive programs  shares registered under these registration statements will be available for sale into the public markets 
our ability to use net operating loss carryovers to reduce future tax payments will be limited 
section of the internal revenue code contains rules that limit the ability of a company that undergoes an ownership change  which is generally any change in ownership of of its stock over a three year period  to utilize its net operating loss carryforward and certain built in losses recognized in years after the ownership change 
these rules generally operate by focusing on ownership changes involving stockholders owning directly or indirectly or more of the stock of a company and any change in ownership arising from a new issuance of stock by the company 
we have determined that an ownership change occurred within the second quarter of  and  therefore  losses carried into the change period will be limited on a go forward basis 
the annual limitation is equal to the product of the applicable long term tax exempt rate and the value of our stock immediately before the ownership change  adjusted for certain items 
the annual limitation may be increased by certain built in gains existing at the time of change 
in addition to the second quarter ownership change  we have had previous ownership changes

executive overview during  we continued to make progress in implementing our long term growth strategy  integrating previous acquisitions  and building a platform for future growth 
our primary long term growth objectives are to grow our revenues  adjusted ebitda  cash from facility operations and facility operating income primarily through a combination of i organic growth in our core business  including expense control and the realization of economies of scale  ii continued expansion of our ancillary services programs including therapy  home health and hospice services  iii expansion  redevelopment and repositioning of our existing communities  and iv acquisitions of additional operating companies and communities 

table of contents our operating results for the year ended december  were favorably impacted by an increase in our total revenues  primarily driven by an increase in average monthly revenue per unit  including an increase in our ancillary services revenue  the inclusion of revenue from recent acquisitions and expansions  and an increase in occupancy 
although we have made significant progress in many areas of our business  the difficult operating environment has continued to result in occupancy rates that are lower than historical levels and diminished growth in the rates we charge our residents 
during  we continued our efforts to strengthen our financial position 
for example  in early  we entered into a new revolving credit facility with general electric capital corporation  as administrative agent 
the facility had an initial commitment of million  with an option to increase the commitment to million which we exercised during the second quarter  and was scheduled to mature on june  on january   we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with general electric capital corporation  as administrative agent and lender  and the other lenders from time to time parties thereto 
the amended credit agreement amended and restated the previous credit agreement 
the amended credit agreement increased the commitment under the credit facility to million and extended the maturity date to january  effective february   the commitment under the amended credit agreement was further increased to million 
furthermore  we have refinanced  repaid or exercised extension options on a number of mortgage loans and  factoring in contractual extension options  have no mortgage debt maturities until other than periodic  scheduled principal payments 
as a result of our recent operating performance and the steps we have recently taken to improve our liquidity position  we ended the year with million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheet and million of undrawn capacity on our revolving credit facility 
the table below presents a summary of our operating results and certain other financial metrics for the years ended december  and and the amount and percentage of increase or decrease of each applicable item dollars in millions 
years ended december  increase decrease amount percent total revenue net loss adjusted ebitda cash from facility operations facility operating income net loss for and includes non cash impairment charges of million and million  respectively 
adjusted ebitda and facility operating income are non gaap financial measures we use in evaluating our operating performance 
cash from facility operations is a non gaap financial measure we use in evaluating our liquidity 
see non gaap financial measures below for an explanation of how we define each of these measures  a detailed description of why we believe such measures are useful and the limitations of each measure  a reconciliation of net loss to each of adjusted ebitda and facility operating income and a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to cash from facility operations 
our revenues for the year ended december  increased to billion  an increase of million  or  over our revenues for the year ended december  the increase in revenues in the current year was primarily a result of an increase in the average monthly revenue per unit compared to the prior year  including growing revenues from our ancillary services programs  the inclusion of revenue from recent acquisitions and expansions  and an increase in occupancy 
our weighted average occupancy rate for our owned leased communities for the year ended december  and was and  respectively 
beginning in  occupancy rates and average monthly revenue per unit are being reported using an average unit methodology based on a consistent treatment of units across all product lines  as compared to the historical method where occupancy was reported based upon unit calculations that varied by product line 
occupancy rates and average monthly revenue per unit for and have been recast to conform to the current presentation 

table of contents during the year ended december   our adjusted ebitda  cash from facility operations and facility operating income increased by  and  respectively  when compared to the year ended december during  we engaged in a limited amount of acquisition activity 
we acquired the fee simple interest in four communities we previously operated under an operating lease 
the aggregate purchase price for the interest was million 
additionally  we purchased and entered into a sale leaseback arrangement with respect to one of our communities and acquired seven home health agencies during the year 
during  we continued to expand our ancillary services offerings 
as of december   we offered therapy services to approximately  of our units and home health services to approximately  of our units 
we continue to see positive results from the maturation of previously opened therapy and home health clinics 
we also expect to continue to expand our ancillary services programs to additional units and to open or acquire additional home health agencies 
we believe that the deteriorating housing market  credit crisis and general economic uncertainty have caused some potential customers or their adult children to delay or reconsider moving into our communities  resulting in a decrease in occupancy rates and occupancy levels when compared to historical levels 
we remain cautious about the economy and the adverse credit and financial markets and their effect on our customers and our business 
in addition  we continue to experience volatility in the entrance fee portion of our business 
the timing of entrance fee sales is subject to a number of different factors including the ability of potential customers to sell their existing homes and is also inherently subject to variability positively or negatively when measured over the short term 
these factors also impact our potential independent living customers to a significant extent 
we expect occupancy and entrance fee sales to normalize over the longer term

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap  requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the estimate  or different estimates that could have been selected  could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect significant estimates and judgments 
revenue recognition and assumptions at entrance fee communities our entrance fee communities provide housing and healthcare services through entrance fee agreements with residents 
under certain of these agreements  residents pay an entrance fee upon entering into the contract and are contractually guaranteed certain limited lifecare benefits in the form of healthcare discounts 
the recognition of entrance fee income requires the use of various actuarial estimates 
we recognize this revenue by recording the non refundable portion of the residents entrance fees as deferred entrance fee income and amortizing it into revenue using the straight line method over the estimated remaining life expectancy of each resident or couple 
in addition  certain entrance fee agreements entitle the resident to a refund of the original entrance fee paid plus a percentage of the appreciation of the unit contingent upon resale 
we estimate the portion of such entrance fees that will be repaid to the resident from other contingently refundable entrance fees received or non refundable entrance fees received and record that portion as deferred revenue with the remainder classified as refundable entrance fees 
the portion recorded as deferred revenue is amortized over the life of the entrance fee building 
we periodically assess the reasonableness of these mortality tables and other actuarial assumptions  and measurement of future service obligations 
obligation to provide future services annually  we calculate the present value of the net cost of future services and the use of communities to be provided to current residents of certain of our ccrcs and compare that amount with the balance of non refundable deferred revenue from entrance fees received 
if the present value of the net cost of future services and the use of communities exceeds the related anticipated revenues including non refundable deferred revenue from entrance fees  a liability is recorded obligation to provide future services and use of communities with a corresponding charge to income 
self insurance liability accruals we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business 
although we maintain general liability and professional liability insurance policies for our owned  leased and managed communities under a master insurance program  our current policy provides for deductibles for each and every 
table of contents claim  effective january  and  effective january  
the amount of liquid assets separately available to satisfy these deductible obligations is million as of december  classified as cash and escrow deposits restricted in the consolidated balance sheets 
as a result  we are effectively self insured for claims that are less than  in addition  we maintain a self insured workers compensation program with excess loss coverage generally above million per individual claim on or prior to december  and million effective january  and a self insured employee medical program with excess loss coverage above million per individual claim 
we are self insured for amounts below these excess loss coverage amounts 
we have formed a wholly owned captive insurance company  senior services insurance limited ssil for the purpose of insuring certain portions of our risk retention under our general and professional liability insurance programs 
ssil issues policies of insurance to and receives premiums from brookdale senior living inc that are reimbursed through expense allocation to each operated community and us 
ssil pays the costs for each claim above a deductible up to a per claim limit 
third party insurers are responsible for claim costs above this limit 
these third party insurers carry an am best rating of a vii or better 
the cost of our employee health and dental benefits  net of employee contributions  is shared by us and our communities based on the respective number of participants working directly either at our corporate headquarters or at the communities 
cash received is used to pay the actual costs of administering the program which include paid claims  third party administrative fees  network provider fees  communication costs  and other related administrative costs incurred by us 
claims are paid as they are submitted to the plan administrator 
outstanding losses and expenses for general liability and professional liability and workers compensation are estimated based on the recommendations of independent actuaries and management s estimates 
outstanding losses and expenses for our self insured medical program are estimated based on the recommendation of our third party administrator 
we review the adequacy of our accruals related to these liabilities on an ongoing basis  using historical claims  actuarial valuations  third party administrator estimates  consultants  advice from legal counsel and industry data  and adjust accruals periodically 
estimated costs related to these self insurance programs are accrued based on known claims and projected claims incurred but not yet reported 
subsequent changes in actual experience are monitored and estimates are updated as information is available 
investment in unconsolidated ventures in accordance with asc  the general partner or managing member of a venture consolidates the venture unless the limited partners or other members have either the substantive ability to dissolve the venture or otherwise remove the general partner or managing member without cause or substantive participating rights in significant decisions of the venture  including authorizing operating and capital decisions of the venture  including budgets  in the ordinary course of business 
we have reviewed all ventures that are not vies where we are the general partner or managing member and have determined that in all cases the limited partners or other members have substantive participating rights such as those set forth above and  therefore  no ventures are consolidated 
for ventures not consolidated  we apply the equity method of accounting in accordance with asc investments equity method and joint ventures topic 
equity method investments are initially recorded at cost and subsequently are adjusted for our share of the venture s earnings or losses and cash distributions 
in accordance with this guidance  the allocation of profit and losses should be analyzed to determine how an increase or decrease in net assets of the venture determined in conformity with gaap will affect cash payments to the investor over the life of the venture and on its liquidation 
because certain venture agreements contain preferences with regard to cash flows from operations  capital events and or liquidation  we reflect our share of profits and losses by determining the difference between our claim on the investee s book value at the end and the beginning of the period 
this claim is calculated as the amount that we would receive or be obligated to pay if the investee were to liquidate all of its assets at recorded amounts determined in accordance with gaap and distribute the resulting cash to creditors and investors in accordance with their respective priorities 
this method is commonly referred to as the hypothetical liquidation at book value method 
our reported share of earnings is adjusted for the impact  if any  of basis differences between our carrying value of the equity investment and our share of the venture s underlying assets 
we generally do not have future requirements to contribute additional capital over and above the original capital commitments  and therefore  we 
table of contents discontinue applying the equity method of accounting when our investment is reduced to zero barring an expectation of an imminent return to profitability 
if the venture subsequently reports net income  the equity method of accounting is resumed only after our share of that net income equals the share of net losses not recognized during the period the equity method was suspended 
when the majority equity partner in one of our ventures sells its equity interest to a third party  the venture frequently refinances its senior debt and distributes the net proceeds to the equity partners 
all distributions received by us are first recorded as a reduction of our investment 
next  we record a liability for any contractual or implied future financial support to the venture including obligations in our role as a general partner 
any remaining distributions are recorded as the company s share of earnings and return on investment in unconsolidated ventures in the consolidated statements of operations 
we evaluate realization of our investment in ventures accounted for using the equity method if circumstances indicate that our investment is other than temporarily impaired 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the provisions of asc income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are expected to be realized 
as of december  and  we have a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets of approximately million and million  respectively 
when we determine that it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be made and reflected in income 
this determination will be made by considering various factors  including the reversal of existing temporary differences  tax planning strategies and estimates of future taxable income exclusive of the reversal of temporary differences 
lease accounting we determine whether to account for our leases as either operating or capital leases depending on the underlying terms 
as of december   we operated communities under long term leases with operating  capital and financing lease obligations 
the determination of this classification is complex and in certain situations requires a significant level of judgment 
our classification criteria is based on estimates regarding the fair value of the leased communities  minimum lease payments  effective cost of funds  the economic life of the community and certain other terms in the lease agreements as stated in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
communities under operating leases are accounted for in our statement of operations as lease expenses for actual rent paid plus or minus straight line adjustments for fixed or estimated minimum lease escalators and amortization of deferred gains 
for communities under capital lease and lease financing obligation arrangements  a liability is established on our balance sheet and a corresponding long term asset is recorded 
lease payments are allocated between principal and interest on the remaining base lease obligations and the lease asset is depreciated over the shorter of its useful life or the term of the lease 
in addition  we amortize leasehold improvements purchased during the term of the lease over the shorter of their economic life or the lease term 
sale leaseback transactions are recorded as lease financing obligations when the transactions include a form of continuing involvement  such as purchase options 
one of our leases provides for various additional lease payments based on changes in the interest rates on the debt underlying the lease 
all of our leases contain fixed or formula based rent escalators 
to the extent that the escalator increases are tied to a fixed index or rate  lease payments are accounted for on a straight line basis over the life of the lease 
in addition  we recognize all rent free or rent holiday periods in operating leases on a straight line basis over the lease term  including the rent holiday period 
for leases in which the company is involved with the construction of the building  the company accounts for the lease during the construction period under the provisions of asc if the company concludes that it has substantively all of the risks of ownership during construction of a leased property and therefore is deemed the owner of the project for accounting purposes  it records an asset and related financing obligation for the amount of total project costs related to construction in progress and the pre existing asset 
once construction is complete  the company considers the requirements under asc leases sale leaseback transactions 
if the 
table of contents arrangement does not qualify for sale leaseback accounting  the company continues to amortize the financing obligation and depreciate the building over the lease term 
allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are reported net of an allowance for doubtful accounts  and represent our estimate of the amount that ultimately will be realized in cash 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed on an ongoing basis  using historical payment trends  write off experience  analyses of receivable portfolios by payor source and aging of receivables  as well as a review of specific accounts  and adjustments are made to the allowance as necessary 
recent changes in legislation are not expected to have a material impact on the collectability of our accounts receivable  however  changes in economic conditions could have an impact on the collection of existing receivable balances or future allowance calculations 
approximately and of the company s resident and healthcare revenues for the year ended december  and  respectively  were derived from private pay customers and and of the company s resident and healthcare revenues for the year ended december  and  respectively  were derived from services covered by various third party payor programs  including medicare and medicaid 
billings for services under third party payor programs are recorded net of estimated retroactive adjustments  if any  under reimbursement programs 
revenue related to these billings is recorded on an estimated basis in the period the related services are rendered and adjusted in future periods or as final settlements are determined 
we accrue contractual or cost related adjustments from medicare or medicaid when assessed without regard to when the assessment is paid or withheld  even if we have not agreed to or are appealing the assessment 
subsequent positive or negative adjustments to these accrued amounts are recorded in net revenues when known 
long lived assets  goodwill and purchase accounting as of december  and  our long lived assets were comprised primarily of billion and billion  respectively  of property  plant and equipment and leasehold intangibles 
in accounting for our long lived assets  other than goodwill  we apply the provisions of asc property  plant and equipment 
in connection with our formation transactions  for financial reporting purposes we recorded the non controlling stockholders interest at fair value 
acquisitions are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and the purchase prices are allocated to acquired assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values 
goodwill associated with our acquisition of arc and our formation transactions was allocated to the respective reporting unit and included in our application of the provisions of asc intangibles goodwill and other asc 
we account for goodwill under the provisions of asc as of december  and  we had million and million of goodwill  respectively 
we test long lived assets other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for recoverability annually during our fourth quarter or whenever changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
recoverability of an asset group is estimated by comparing its carrying value to the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group 
if this comparison indicates that the carrying value of an asset group is not recoverable  we are required to recognize an impairment loss 
the impairment loss is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its estimated fair value 
when an impairment loss is recognized for assets to be held and used  the carrying amount of those assets is permanently adjusted and depreciated over its remaining useful life 
during the years ended december  and  we evaluated long lived depreciable assets using the same cash flow data used to evaluate goodwill and determined that the undiscounted cash flows exceeded the carrying value of these assets for all except a small number of communities 
estimated fair values were determined and a non cash asset impairment charge of million and million was taken for the quarters ended december  and  respectively  for five and four communities  respectively  within the retirement centers and assisted living segment 
goodwill is not amortized  but is subject to annual or more frequent impairment testing 
we test goodwill for impairment annually during our fourth quarter  or whenever indicators exist that our goodwill may not be recoverable 
the recoverability of goodwill is required to be assessed using a two step process 
the first step requires a comparison of the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value  the second step requires a comparison of the implied fair 
table of contents value of goodwill based on a putative purchase price allocation methodology with its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess 
indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually during our fourth quarter or more frequently as required 
the impairment test consists of a comparison of the estimated fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset with its carrying value 
if the carrying amount exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized for that difference 
in estimating the fair value of long lived assets groups and reporting units for purposes of our goodwill impairment test  we generally use the income approach 
the income approach utilizes future cash flow projections that are developed internally 
any estimates of future cash flow projections necessarily involve predicting an unknown future and require significant management judgments and estimates 
in arriving at our cash flow projections  we consider our historic operating results  approved budgets and business plans  future demographic factors  expected growth rates  and other factors 
future events may indicate differences from management s current judgments and estimates  which could  in turn  result in future impairments 
future events that may result in impairment charges include increases in interest rates  which could impact discount rates  differences in the projected occupancy rates and changes in the cost structure of existing communities 
in using the income approach to estimate the fair value of long lived assets groups and reporting units for purposes of our goodwill impairment test  we make certain key assumptions 
those assumptions include future revenues and future facility operating expenses  and future cash flows that we would receive upon a sale of the communities using estimated capitalization rates 
we corroborate the capitalization rates we use in these calculations with capitalization rates observable from recent market transactions 
where required  future cash flows are discounted at a rate that is consistent with a weighted average cost of capital from a market participant perspective 
the weighted average cost of capital is an estimate of the overall after tax rate of return required by equity and debt holders of a business enterprise 
although we make every reasonable effort to ensure the accuracy of our estimate of the fair value of our reporting units  future changes in the assumptions used to make these estimates could result in the recording of an impairment loss 
hedging we periodically enter into certain interest rate swap or cap agreements to effectively convert floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis or to hedge anticipated future financings 
amounts paid or received under these agreements are recognized as an adjustment to interest expense when such amounts are incurred or earned 
for effective cash flow hedges  settlement amounts paid or received in connection with settled or unwound interest rate swap agreements are deferred and recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income 
for effective fair value hedges  changes in the fair value of the derivative will be offset against the corresponding change in fair value of the hedged asset or liability through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value will be recognized in earnings 
all derivative instruments are recorded at fair value 
derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recorded at fair value through earnings 
on october   we elected to discontinue hedge accounting prospectively for the previously designated swap instruments 
consequently  the net gain accumulated in other comprehensive income at that date of approximately million related to the previously designated swap instruments is being reclassified to interest expense over the life of the underlying hedged debt 
in the future  if the underlying hedged debt is extinguished or refinanced  the remaining unamortized gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income will be recognized in net income 
in measuring our derivative instruments at fair value  we have considered nonperformance risk in our valuation 
in so doing  we review the netting arrangement and collateral requirements of each instrument and counterparty to determine appropriate reductions of credit exposure 
remaining credit exposure is estimated by reference to market prices for credit default swaps and or other methods of estimating probabilities of default 

table of contents stock based compensation we adopted asc compensation stock compensation in connection with initial grants of restricted stock effective august  which were converted into shares of our restricted stock on september  in connection with our formation transaction 
asc requires measurement of the cost of employee services received in exchange for stock compensation based on the grant date fair value of the employee stock awards 
incremental compensation costs arising from subsequent modifications of awards after the grant date must be recognized when incurred 
certain of our employee stock awards vest only upon the achievement of performance targets 
asc requires recognition of compensation cost only when achievement of performance conditions is considered probable 
consequently  our determination of the amount of stock compensation expense requires a significant level of judgment in estimating the probability of achievement of these performance targets 
additionally  we must make estimates regarding employee forfeitures in determining compensation expense 
subsequent changes in actual experience are monitored and estimates are updated as information is available 
litigation litigation is inherently uncertain and the outcome of individual litigation matters is not predictable with assurance 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  we are involved in various legal actions and claims incidental to the conduct of our business which are comparable to other companies in the senior living and healthcare industries 
we have established loss provisions for matters in which losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
in other instances  we may not be able to make a reasonable estimate of any liability because of uncertainties related to the outcome and or the amount or range of losses 
changes in our current estimates  due to unanticipated events or otherwise  could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations
