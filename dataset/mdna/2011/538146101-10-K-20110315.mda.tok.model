table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that management believes are reasonable based upon the information available 
we base these estimates on our historical experience  future expectations and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for our judgments that may not be readily apparent from other sources 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
these estimates and assumptions relate to estimates of the carrying amount of goodwill  intangibles  stock based compensation  valuation allowances for deferred income taxes  accounts receivable  the expected term of a client relationship  accruals and other factors 
we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions  and any differences could be material

table of contents financial overview for the three and twelve months ended december  financial overview of the three and twelve months ended december  compared to the comparable periods in are as follows revenue increased and to million and million in the three and twelve months ended december   respectively from million and million in the comparable periods in gross profit margin decreased to and in the three and twelve months ended december  from in the in the comparable periods in operating expenses increased to million and million in the three and twelve months ended december   respectively from million and million in the comparable periods in net income decreased to million in the three months ended december  from net income of million for the three months ended december  net income increased to million in the twelve months ended december  from net income of million for the twelve months ended december  critical accounting policies and estimates the significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the reported consolidated financial results include the following revenue recognition the majority of our revenue is generated from monthly service revenues and related professional services from the sale of liveperson services 
because we provide our application as a service  we follow the provisions of asc s  revenue recognition and  revenue recognition with multiple element arrangements 
we charge a monthly fee  which varies by type of service  the level of client usage and website traffic  and in some cases  the number of orders placed via our online engagement solutions 
for certain of our larger clients  we may provide call center labor through an arrangement with one or more of several qualified partners 
for most of these clients  we pass the fee we incur with the labor provider and our fee for the hosted services through to our customers in the form of a fixed fee for each order placed via our online engagement solutions 
for these arrangements  we recognize revenue net of the labor provider s fee in accordance with asc  principal agent considerations  due to the fact that we perform as an agent without risk of loss for collection 
the majority of our larger clients also pay a professional services fee related to implementation 
we defer these implementation fees and associated direct costs and recognize them ratably over the expected term of the client relationship upon commencement of the hosting services 
we may also charge professional service fees related to additional training  business consulting and analysis in support of the liveperson services 
we also sell certain of the liveperson services directly via internet download 
these services are marketed as liveperson pro and liveperson contact center for small and mid sized businesses smbs  and are paid for almost exclusively by credit card 
credit card payments accelerate cash flow and reduce our collection risk  subject to the merchant bank s right to hold back cash pending settlement of the transactions 
sales of liveperson pro and liveperson contact center may occur with or without the assistance of an online sales representative  rather than through face to face or telephone contact that is typically required for traditional direct sales 
we recognize monthly service revenue based upon the fee charged for the liveperson services  provided that there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  no significant company obligations remain  collection of the resulting receivable is probable and the amount of fees to be paid is fixed or determinable 
our service agreements typically have twelve month terms and are terminable or may terminate upon to days notice without penalty 
when professional service fees provide added value to the customer on a standalone basis  we recognize professional service fees upon completion and customer acceptance because we have established objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered hosting services 
if a 
table of contents professional services arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting  we recognize the fees  and the related labor costs  ratably over a period of months  representing our current estimate of the term of the client relationship 
for revenue generated from online transactions between experts and users  we recognize revenue net of expert fees in accordance with asc  principal agent considerations  due to the fact that we perform as an agent without any risk of loss for collection 
we collect a fee from the consumer and retain a portion of the fee  and then remit the balance to the expert 
revenue from these transactions is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  no significant company obligations remain  collection of the resulting receivable is probable and the amount of fees to be paid is fixed or determinable 
stock based compensation we follow asc  stock compensation  which addresses the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services  with a primary focus on transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
asc is a revision to sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance 
asc requires measurement of the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award with limited exceptions 
incremental compensation costs arising from subsequent modifications of awards after the grant date must be recognized 
as of december   there was approximately million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share based compensation arrangements 
that cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately years 
accounts receivable our customers are located primarily in the united states 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition except for customers who purchase the liveperson services by credit card via internet download and have established an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of customers  historical trends and other information that we believe to be reasonable  although they may change in the future 
if there is a deterioration of a customer s credit worthiness or actual write offs are higher than our historical experience  our estimates of recoverability for these receivables could be adversely affected 
our concentration of credit risk is limited due to our large number of customers 
no single customer accounted for or exceeded of our total revenue in  and one customer accounted for approximately and of accounts receivable at december  and  respectively 
we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts by  to approximately  principally due to an increase in accounts receivable as a result of increased sales 
a larger proportion of receivables are due from larger corporate clients that typically have longer payment cycles 
goodwill in accordance with asc  goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized  but reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that would reduce the fair value below its carrying amount 
goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit under the first step of the goodwill impairment test and determining the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit including unrecognized intangible assets under the second step of the goodwill impairment test is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
similarly  estimates and assumptions are used in determining the fair value of other intangible assets 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge 
to assist in the process of determining goodwill impairment  we will obtain appraisals from an independent valuation firm 
in addition to the use of an independent valuation firm  we will perform internal valuation analyses and consider other market information that is publicly available 
estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and market comparisons 
these approaches use significant estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows including timing  discount rates 
table of contents reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows  perpetual growth rates  determination of appropriate market comparables and the determination of whether a premium or discount should be applied to comparables 
in  the company evaluated goodwill using a combination of discounted cash flows  prior transactions and quoted market prices methods and determined that no impairment had occurred 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with asc  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  long lived assets  such as property  plant and equipment and purchased intangibles subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying value of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying value of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying value or the fair value less costs to sell  and are no longer depreciated 
the assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet 
use of estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires our management to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period 
significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the carrying amount of goodwill  intangibles  stock based compensation  valuation allowances for deferred income tax assets  accounts receivable  the expected term of a client relationship  accruals and other factors 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
recently issued fasb accounting standards updates in december  the fasb has issued asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic when to perform step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
this asu reflects the decision reached in eitf issue no 
a 
the amendments in this asu modify step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
for those reporting units  an entity is required to perform step of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
in determining whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists  an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist 
the qualitative factors are consistent with the existing guidance and examples  which require that goodwill of a reporting unit be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
for public entities  the amendments in this asu are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  early adoption is not permitted 
this update will have an impact on our accounting in the future for any reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
in january  the fasb published fasb accounting standards update  fair value measurements and disclosures topic improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
this update requires some new disclosures and clarifies some existing disclosure requirements about fair value measurement as set forth in codification subtopic the fasb s objective is to improve these disclosures and  thus  increase the transparency in financial reporting 
specifically  asu amends codification subtopic to now require a a reporting entity to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements and describe the reasons for the transfers  and b in the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs  a reporting entity should present separately information about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements 
in addition  asu clarifies the requirements of the following existing disclosures for purposes of 
table of contents reporting fair value measurement for each class of assets and liabilities  a reporting entity needs to use judgment in determining the appropriate classes of assets and liabilities and should provide disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements 
asu is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements in the roll forward of activity in level fair value measurements 
those disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
as asu relates specifically to disclosures  it will not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  fasb accounting standards update addressed the accounting for multiple deliverable arrangements to enable vendors to account for products or services deliverables separately rather than as a combined unit 
specifically  this update amends the criteria in subtopic  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements  for separating consideration in multiple deliverable arrangements 
this guidance establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable  which is based on a vendor specific objective evidence  b third party evidence  or c estimates 
this guidance also eliminates the residual method of allocation and requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method 
in addition  this guidance significantly expands required disclosures related to a vendor s multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
fasb accounting standards update is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  early adoption is permitted 
we are currently assessing the impact of this update on our consolidated financial statements 
revenue the majority of our revenue is generated from monthly service revenues and related professional services from the sale of the liveperson services 
we charge a monthly fee  which varies by service and client usage 
the majority of our larger clients also pay a professional services fee related to implementation 
a large proportion of our revenue from new clients comes from large corporations 
these companies typically have more significant implementation requirements and more stringent data security standards 
such clients also have more sophisticated data analysis and performance reporting requirements  and are likely to engage our professional services organization to provide such analysis and reporting on a recurring basis
