loss reserves workers compensation business we record reserves for estimated losses under insurance policies that we write and for loss adjustment expenses related to the investigation and settlement of policy claims 
our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses represent the estimated cost of all reported and unreported loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred and unpaid at a given point in time 
in establishing our reserves  we do not use loss discounting  which involves recognizing the time value of money and offsetting estimates of future payments by future expected investment income 
our process and methodology for estimating reserves applies to both our voluntary and assigned risk business and does not include our reserves for mandatory pooling arrangements that we participate in as a condition of doing business in a state that funds workers compensation assigned risk plans in that state 
we record reserves for mandatory pooling arrangements as those reserves are reported to us by the pool administrators 
we use a consulting actuary to assist in the evaluation of the adequacy of our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses 
when a claim is reported  we establish an initial case reserve for the estimated amount of our loss based on our estimate of the most likely outcome of the claim at that time 
generally  a case reserve is established within days after the claim is reported and consists of anticipated medical costs  indemnity costs and specific adjustment expenses  which we refer to as defense and cost containment expenses dcc 
at any point in time  the amount paid on a claim  plus the reserve for future amounts to be paid  represents the estimated total cost of the claim  or the case incurred amount 
the estimated amount of loss for a reported claim is based upon various factors  including type of loss  severity of the injury or damage  age and occupation of the injured employee  estimated length of temporary disability  anticipated permanent disability  expected medical procedures  costs and duration  our knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the claim  insurance policy provisions  including coverage  related to the claim  jurisdiction of the occurrence  and other benefits defined by applicable statute 
the case incurred amount can vary due to uncertainties with respect to medical treatment and outcome  length and degree of disability  employment availability and wage levels and judicial determinations 
as changes occur  the case incurred amount is adjusted 
the initial estimate of the case incurred amount can vary significantly from the amount ultimately paid  especially in circumstances involving severe injuries with comprehensive medical treatment 
changes in case incurred amounts  or case development  are an important component of our historical claim data 
in addition to case reserves  we establish reserves on an aggregate basis for loss and dcc expenses that have been incurred but not reported  or ibnr 
our ibnr reserves are also intended to provide for aggregate changes in case incurred amounts as well as the unpaid cost of recently reported claims for which an initial case reserve has not yet been established 
the third component of our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses is our adjusting and other reserve  or ao reserve 
our ao reserve is established for the costs of future unallocated loss adjustment 
table of contents expenses for all known and unknown claims 
our ao reserve covers primarily the estimated cost of administering claims 
the final component of our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses is the reserve for mandatory pooling arrangements 
we began writing workers compensation in in and  there was limited premium volume  with premiums beginning to increase substantially in in order to establish ibnr reserves  we project ultimate losses by accident year both through use of our historical experience  and the use of industry experience by state 
our consulting actuary projects ultimate losses in two different ways quarterly incurred development method use of amtrust factors 
quarterly incurred loss development factors are derived from our historical  cumulative incurred losses by accident month 
these factors are then applied to the latest actual incurred losses and dcc by month to estimate ultimate losses and dcc  based on the assumption that each accident month will develop to estimated ultimate cost in a similar manner to prior years 
there is a substantial amount of judgment involved in this method 
yearly incurred development use of national council on compensation insurance  inc ncci industry factors by state 
yearly incurred loss development factors are derived from either ncci s annual statistical bulletin or state bureaus 
these factors are then applied to the latest actual incurred losses and dcc by year by state to estimate ultimate losses and dcc  based on the assumption that each year will develop to an estimated ultimate cost similar to the industry development by year by state 
each method produces estimated ultimate loss and dcc expenses net of amounts that will be ultimately paid by our excess of loss reinsurers 
our consulting actuary estimates a range of ultimate losses  along with a selection that gives more weight to the results from our monthly development factors and less weight to the results from industry development factors 
we establish ibnr reserves for our workers compensation segment by determining an ultimate loss pick  which is our estimate of our net loss ratio for a specific period  based on actual incurred losses and application of loss development factors 
we estimate our ultimate incurred loss and dcc for a period by multiplying the ultimate loss pick for the period by the earned premium for the period 
from that total  we subtract actual paid loss and dcc and actual case reserves for reported losses 
the remainder constitutes our ibnr reserves 
on a monthly basis  an outside actuary reviews our ibnr reserves 
on a quarterly basis  we review our determination of our ultimate loss pick 
management establishes our reserves by making judgments based on its application of our and industry wide loss development factors  consideration of our consulting actuary s application of the same loss development factors  and underwriting  claims handling and other operational considerations 
in utilizing its judgment  management makes certain assumptions regarding our business  including  among other things  frequency of claims  severity of claims and claim closure rates 
although we  upon our assumption of the administration of claims from third party administrators in  made adjustments to actual case reserves which impacted our loss development factors and  consequently our reserves  we have not made changes to any of our key assumptions regarding the performance of our business in comparison to the performance of the industry as a whole 
management makes its final selection of loss and dcc reserves after reviewing the actuary s results  consideration of other underwriting  claim handling and operational factors  and the use of judgment 
to establish our ao reserves  we review our past adjustment expenses in relation to past claims and estimate our future costs based on expected claims activity and duration 
as of december   our best estimate of our ultimate liability for workers compensation loss and loss adjustment expenses  net of amounts recoverable from reinsurers  was million  of which million was reserves resulting from our participation in mandatory pooling arrangements  as reported by the pool administrators 
this estimate was derived from the procedures and methods described above  which rely  substantially  on judgment 

table of contents estimating ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses is an inexact process a broad range exists around any estimate 
while management believes its estimates are reasonable  it is possible that our actual loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred may vary significantly from our estimates 
the two methods described above are incurred development methods 
these methods rely on historical development factors derived from changes in our incurred losses  which are estimates of paid claims and case reserves over time 
as a result  if case reserving practices change over time  the two incurred methods may produce substantial variation in the estimate of ultimate losses 
we have not used any paid development methods  which rely on actual claims payment patterns and  therefore  are not sensitive to changes in case reserving procedures 
as our paid historical experience grows  we will consider using paid loss development methods 
of the two methods above  the use of industry loss development factors has consistently produced higher estimates of workers compensation losses and dcc expenses 
the table below shows this higher estimate  along with the lower estimate produced by our monthly factors as of december

amounts in millions loss dcc expense reserves mandatory pooling arrangements total gross workers compensation reserves lower estimate gross reserve higher estimate net workers compensation reserves lower estimate net reserve higher estimate the higher estimate would increase net reserves by million and reduce net income and stockholders equity by million 
the lower net estimate would decrease net reserves by million and increase net income and stockholders equity by million 
a change in our net loss and dcc expense reserve would not have an immediate impact on our liquidity  but would affect cash flows in future years as claim and expense payments made 
in  our liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses lae attributable to prior years decreased by million as result of favorable development in both the small commercial business segment and specialty risk and extended warranty segment  partially offset by unfavorable development in our specialty program business segment as well as our involuntary participation in ncci pools 
in  our liabilities for unpaid losses and lae attributable to prior years decreased by million as result of favorable development in the small commercial business segment  partially offset by unfavorable development from our mandatory participation in assigned risk reinsurance pools 
in  our liabilities for unpaid losses and lae attributable to prior years increased by million as result of unfavorable loss development in our specialty program segment 
we do not anticipate that we will make any material reserve adjustments but will continue to monitor the accuracy of our loss development factors and adequacy of our reserves 
as we write more business and develop more reliable data  we assign more weight to our individual loss development factors than to industry wide factors 
because our losses have  generally  developed more favorably than the industry as a whole  except for and for the ncci pools  our actuarially projected reserves have decreased 
specialty risk and extended warranty specialty risk and extended warranty claims are usually paid quickly  development on known claims is negligible  and generally  case reserves are not established 
ibnr reserves for warranty claims are generally pure ibnr  which refers to amounts for claims that occurred prior to an accounting date but are reported after that date 
the reporting lag for warranty ibnr claims is generally small  usually in the range of one to three months 
management determines warranty ibnr by examining the experience of individual coverage 
table of contents plans 
our consulting actuary  at the end of each calendar year  reviews our ibnr by looking at our overall coverage plan experience  with assumptions of claim reporting lag and average monthly claim payouts 
our net ibnr as of december  and for our specialty risk and extended warranty segment was and million  respectively 
though we believe this is a reasonable best estimate of future claims development  this amount is subject to a substantial degree of uncertainty 
our actual net reserves  including ibnr  on specialty risk and extended warranty as of december  and were and million  respectively 
an upward movement of on overall reserves would result in a reduction of income in of before tax and after tax 
a downward movement of on overall reserves would result in an increase of income of before tax and after tax 
there is generally more uncertainty in the unearned premium reserve than in the ibnr reserve 
in the specialty risk and extended warranty segment  the reserve for unearned premium is  in general  an estimate of our liability for projected future losses emanating from the unearned portion of written contracts 
our liability for return of unearned premium is not significant 
the reserve for specialty risk and extended warranty unearned premium is calculated by analyzing each coverage plan separately  subdivided by contract year  type of product and length of contract  ranging from one month to five years 
these subdivisions produced  in a recent analysis  about separate reserve calculations 
these individual reserve calculations may differ in actuarial methodologies depending on the type of risk  the length of the exposure period  the availability of past loss experience  and the extent of current claim experience and potential experience of similar classes of risk underwritten by the program administrators 
the primary actuarial methodology used to project future losses for the unexpired terms of contracts is to project the future number of claims  then multiply them by an average claim cost 
the future number of claims is derived by applying to unexpired months a selected ratio of the number of claims to expired months 
the selected ratio is determined from a combination of past experience of the same expired policies  current experience of the earned portion of the in force policies or contracts  and past and or current experience of similar type policies or contracts 
the average claim cost is also determined by using past and or current experience of the same or similar contracts 
in order to confirm the validity of the projected future losses derived through application of the average claim cost method  we also utilize a loss ratio method 
the loss ratio method entails the application of the projected ultimate loss ratio  which is based on historical experience  to the unearned portion of the premium 
if the loss ratio method indicates that the average claim cost method has not produced a credible result for a particular coverage plan  we will make a judgment as to the appropriate reserve for that coverage plan 
we generally will choose a point in the range between results generated by the average claim cost method and loss ratio method 
in making our judgment  we consider  among other things  the historical performance of the subject coverage plan or similar plans  our analysis of the performance of the administrator and coverage terms 
different specialty risk and extended warranty products have different patterns of incidence during the period of risk 
some products tend to show increasing incidence of claims during the risk period  others may show relatively uniform incidence of claims  while still others tend to show decreasing claim incidence 
we have assumed  on average  a uniform incidence of claims for all contracts combined  based on our review of contract provisions and claim history 
incorrect earnings of warranty policy premiums  inadequate pricing of warranty products  changes in conditions during long contract durations or incorrect estimates of future warranty losses on unexpired contracts may produce a deficiency or a redundancy in the unearned premium reserve 
our unearned premium reserve as of december  and for our specialty risk and extended warranty segment was 
table of contents million and million  respectively 
although we believe this is a reasonable best estimate of our unearned premium reserve  this amount is subject to a substantial degree of uncertainty 
property and casualty insurance we record reserves for estimated losses under insurance policies that we write and for loss adjustment expense related to the investigation and settlement of policy related claims 
our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses represent the estimated costs of all reported and unreported loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred and unpaid at a given point in time 
in establishing our reserves we do not use loss discounting 
we utilize the services of an independent consulting actuary to assist in the evaluation of the adequacy of our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses 
when a claim is reported  an initial case reserve is established for the estimated amount of the loss based on the adjuster s view of the most likely outcome of the claim at that time 
initial case reserves are established within days of the claim report date and consist of anticipated liability payments  first party payments  medical costs  and dcc expenses 
this establishes a case incurred amount for a particular claim 
the estimated amount of loss for a reported claim is based upon various factors  such as line of business general liability  auto liability  or auto physical damage  severity of injury or property damage  number of claimants  statute of limitation and repose  insurance policy provisions  especially applicable policy limits and coverage limitations  expected medical procedures  costs  and duration treatment  our knowledge of circumstances surrounding the claim  and possible salvage and subrogation 
case incurred amounts can vary greatly because of the uncertainties inherent in the estimates of severity of loss  costs of medical treatments  judicial rulings  litigation expenses  and other factors 
as changes occur  the case reserves are adjusted 
the initial estimate of a claim s incurred amount can vary significantly from the amount ultimately paid when the claim is closed  especially in the circumstances involving litigation and severe personal injuries 
changes in case incurred amounts  also known as case development  are an important component of our historical claim data 
in addition to case reserves  we establish reserves on an aggregate basis for loss and dcc expenses that have been incurred but not yet reported  or ibnr 
our ibnr reserves are also intended to include aggregate development on known claims  provision for claims that re open after they have been closed  and provision for claims that have been reported but have not yet been recorded 
the final component of the reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses is the estimate of the ao reserve 
this reserve is established for the costs of future unallocated loss adjustment expenses for all known and unknown claims 
our ao reserve covers primarily the estimated cost of administering claims by our claim staff 
we began writing general liability  commercial auto and commercial property jointly known as cpp business in as a result  there is a limited amount of loss data available for analysis 
in order to establish ibnr reserves for cpp lines of business  we project ultimate losses by accident year through the use of industry experience by line 
the limited amount of cpp historical data has not allowed us to develop our own development patterns 
instead  we rely on three methods that utilize industry development patterns by line of business yearly incurred development use of industry factors by line 
for each line  the development factors are taken directly from insurance services office  inc iso loss development publications for a specific line of business 
these factors are then applied to the latest actual incurred losses and dcc by accident year  by line of business to estimate ultimate losses and dcc  
table of contents expected loss ratio 
for each line  an expected loss ratio is taken from our original account level pricing analysis 
these loss ratios are then applied to the earned premiums by line by year to estimate ultimate losses and dcc  and bornhuetter ferguson method 
for each line  ibnr factors are developed from the applicable industry loss development factors and expected losses are taken from the original account level pricing analysis 
ibnr factors are then applied to the expected losses to estimate ibnr and dcc 
for cpp lines of business  ultimate loss and ibnr selections are based on one of the above methods depending on the accident year and line of business 
our consulting actuary estimates a range of ultimate losses  along with the recommended ibnr and reserve amounts 
because we determine our reserves based on industry incurred development patterns  our ultimate losses may differ substantially from our estimates produced by the above methods 
because of our limited historical experience  we have not utilized any incurred development methods based on our experience  nor did we use any methods that rely on paid development factors 
paid loss development methods rely on actual claim payment patterns to develop ultimate loss and dcc estimates 
as our historical experience grows  we will consider using incurred development methods based on our historical loss development patterns  as well as paid development methods 
we began writing commercial package business in the second quarter of after our acquisition of ubi 
we were able to access ubi s historical loss data for analysis of that business 
additionally  the claims adjusting has remained stable 
as such  it has allowed us to start developing our own development patterns without the use of industry factors 
similar methods involved in determining reserves are consistent as described above for other property and casualty business

the next section of the table shows  by year  the cumulative amounts of loss and loss adjustment expense payments  net of amounts recoverable from reinsurers  as of the end of each succeeding year 
for example  with respect to the net loss reserves of million as of december   by december  two years later  million had actually been paid in settlement of the claims that relate to liabilities as of december  the cumulative redundancy deficiency represents  as of december   the difference between the latest re estimated liability and the amounts as originally estimated 
a redundancy means that the original estimate was higher than the current estimate 
a deficiency means that the current estimate is higher than the original estimate

us treasury aaa aa a bbb  bbb  bbb bb  bb  bb b  b  b  other includes securities rated cc  ccc  ccc and d total our equity investments  which constitute of our investment portfolio  typically consist of small capitalized companies with an average market capitalization of approximately million  most without widespread distribution or trading of shares 
we have invested in securities in which we believe true value is not properly reflected in the market price and where a catalyst  or event  will send the market price toward its estimate of true value 
we typically have a holding period of months for our equity securities 
this catalyst  in many instances  takes up to months to occur 
sometimes  a catalyst that does not occur soon after our initial investment requires the passage of another operating cycle  and the month time frame allows for these types of situations 
these equity securities tend to be relatively unknown stocks that have less trading volume than well known or larger capitalized stocks and can  therefore  experience significant price fluctuations without fundamental reasons 
these price fluctuations can be large on a percentage basis because many stocks in this category are also low priced stocks that are often distressed or in a turnaround phase 
we believe that in down markets  equity securities with lower turnover are more heavily penalized by the market  even when the underlying fundamentals of the security have held up 
therefore  we believe  and our experience bears out  that  for investments in small cap stocks  an unrealized loss of or less is not necessarily indicative of a fundamental problem with the issuer 
prices of lower turnover stocks can also react significantly to a catalyst or an event that causes market participants to take an interest 
when the market participants interest increases in an equity security  causing trading volume and market bid to increase  we 
table of contents typically seek to exit these positions 
for these reasons  we generally consider certain equity investments to be other than temporarily impaired when the investment is in an unrealized loss position in excess of of cost basis for greater than months

certain international tax considerations we operate our business in several foreign countries and are subject to taxation in several foreign jurisdictions 
a brief description of certain international tax considerations affecting us appears below 
we will be subject to us income taxation on any income of our foreign subsidiaries that is subpart f income 
bermuda bermuda currently does not impose any income  corporation or profits tax  withholding tax  capital gains tax or capital transfer tax on aii  our bermuda subsidiary  or any estate duty or inheritance tax applicable to shares of aii except in the case of shareholders resident in bermuda 
except as set out in the following paragraph  no assurance can be given that aii will not be subject to any such tax in the future 
aii has received a written assurance from the bermuda minister of finance under the exempted undertakings tax protection act of bermuda  as amended  that  if any legislation is enacted in bermuda imposing tax computed on profits or income  or computed on any capital asset  gain or appreciation  or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax  then the imposition of that tax would not be applicable to aii or to any of its operations  shares  debentures or obligations until march   provided that the assurance is subject to the condition that it will not be construed to prevent the application of such tax to people ordinarily resident in bermuda  or to prevent the application of any taxes payable by aii in respect of real property or leasehold interests in bermuda held by it 
no assurance can be given that aii will not be subject to any such tax after march  for us federal income tax purposes  our bermuda subsidiaries are controlled foreign corporations 
a majority of the income of these subsidiaries  which consists primarily of foreign personal holding company income such as investment income and income from reinsuring risks  is categorized as subpart f income 
we must include in our taxable income for us federal income tax purposes this subpart f income 
ireland amtrust international underwriters limited aiu  a company incorporated in ireland  is managed and controlled in ireland and  therefore  is resident in ireland for irish tax purposes and subject to irish corporation tax on its worldwide profits including revenue profits and capital gains 
income derived by aiu from an irish trade that is  a trade that is not carried on wholly outside of ireland will be subject to irish corporation tax at the current rate of 
other income that is  income from passive investments  income from non irish trades and income from certain dealings in land is generally subject to irish corporation tax at the current rate of 
the irish revenue commissioners have published a statement indicating that deposit interest earned by an insurance company on funds held for regulatory purposes will be regarded as part of the insurance company s trading income  and accordingly will be part of the profits taxed at 
this statement also indicates acceptance of case law that states that investment income of an insurance company will likewise be considered as trading income where it is derived from assets required to be held for regulatory capital purposes 
other investment income earned by aiu will generally be taxed in ireland at a rate of 
capital gains realized by aiu will generally be subject to irish corporation tax at an effective rate of 
for us federal income tax purposes  aiu is a controlled foreign corporation and its income generally will be included in our us federal taxable income 
a credit against us federal income tax liability is available for any irish tax paid on such income 
if aiu carries on a trade in the united kingdom through a permanent establishment in the uk  profits realized from such a trade in the uk will be subject to irish corporation tax notwithstanding that such profits 
table of contents may also be subject to taxation in the uk a credit against the irish corporation tax liability will be available for any uk tax paid on such profits  subject to the maximum credit being equal to the irish corporation tax payable on such profits 
as long as our principal class of common stock is listed on a recognized stock exchange in an eu member state or country with which ireland has a tax treaty  and provided that such shares are substantially and regularly traded on that exchange  irish dividend withholding tax will not apply to dividends and other distributions paid by aiu to aii  provided that aii makes an appropriate declaration  in prescribed form  to aiu before the dividend is paid 
amtrust or any of our subsidiaries  other than aiu  will not be resident in ireland for irish tax purposes unless the central management and control of such companies is  as a matter of fact  located in ireland 
insurance companies are subject to an insurance premium tax in the form of a stamp duty charged at of certain premium income 
it applies to general insurance business  mainly business other than reinsurance  life insurance certain  maritime  aviation and transit insurance  and health insurance 
it applies to a premium in respect of a policy where the risk is located in ireland 
legislation provides that risk is located in ireland in the case of insurance of buildings together with their contents  where the building is in ireland  in the case of insurance of vehicles  where the vehicle is registered in ireland  in the case of insurance of four months or less duration of travel or holiday if the policyholder took out the policy in ireland  and in all three cases of insurance where the policyholder is resident in ireland  or if not an individual  where the head office of the policyholder is in ireland or its branch to which the insurance relates is in ireland 
luxembourg achl  a luxembourg holding company  is owned by aii  our bermuda insurance company 
achl owns all of the issued and outstanding stock of three luxembourg domiciled captive insurance companies that had accumulated equalization reserves  which are catastrophe reserves in excess of required reserves that are determined by a formula based on the volatility of the business reinsured 
because aii is an insurance company with the ability to cede losses  the captives are well positioned to utilize their equalization reserves 
luxembourg does not impose any income  corporation or profits tax on achl provided sufficient losses cause the equalization reserves to be exhausted 
however  if the captives cease to write business or are unable to utilize their equalization reserves  they will ultimately recognize income that will be taxed by luxembourg at a rate of approximately 
for us federal income tax purposes  achl is a controlled foreign corporation and its taxable income  if any  will be included in our us federal taxable income 
a credit against us federal income tax liability is available for any luxembourg tax paid on such income 
united kingdom ael  a company incorporated in the united kingdom  is managed and controlled in the uk and  therefore  is treated as a resident in the uk for british tax purposes and subject to british corporation tax on its worldwide profits including revenue profits and capital gains 
income derived by ael will be subject to british corporation tax at the rate of 

table of contents for us federal income tax purposes  ael is a controlled foreign corporation and its income generally will be included in our us federal taxable income 
a credit against us federal income tax liability is available for any british tax paid on such income 
if ael carries on a trade in ireland through a permanent establishment in ireland  profits realized from such a trade in ireland will be subject to uk corporation tax notwithstanding that such profits may also be subject to taxation in ireland 
a credit against the british corporation tax liability is available for any irish tax paid on such profits  subject to the maximum credit being equal to the british corporation tax payable on such profits 
ael may pay dividends to aii  its direct parent company  free of uk withholding tax 
we expect that neither amtrust nor any of our subsidiaries  other than ael  will be resident in the uk for british tax purposes unless the central management and control of such companies is  as a matter of fact  located in the uk a company not resident in the uk for british tax purposes can be subject to british corporation tax if it carries on a trade through a branch or agency in the uk or disposes of certain specified assets eg  british land  minerals  or mineral rights  or unquoted shares deriving the greater part of their value from such assets 
in such cases  the charge to british corporation tax is limited to trading income connected with the branch or agency  capital gains on the disposal of assets used in the branch or agency which are situated in the uk at or before the time of disposal  capital gains arising on the disposal of specified assets  with tax imposed at the rates discussed above  plus uk income tax generally by way of withholding on certain uk source income 
insurance companies are subject to an insurance premium tax at 
the premium tax applies to premiums for most general insurance  such as for buildings and contents and motor insurance  where the insured risk is in the uk life assurance and other long term insurance remain exempt  though there are anti avoidance rules surrounding long term medical care policies 
as an anti avoidance measure  the rate increases to for insurance sold by suppliers of specified goods or services  eg mechanical breakdown insurance  travel insurance irrespective of supplier  insurance sold with televisions and car hire  and  from april  forward  any non financial gap insurance sold through suppliers of motor vehicles or persons connected with them 
in further anti avoidance measures introduced march   the definition of premium was amended to make it clear that any payment received in respect of a right to require an insurer to provide  or offer to provide  cover under a taxable contract of insurance is regarded as a premium 
ratings many insurance buyers  agents and brokers use the ratings assigned by am best and other agencies to assist them in assessing the financial strength and overall quality of the companies from which they are considering purchasing insurance 
aii  tic  ric  wesco insurance company wic  associated industries insurance company aiic  ael  aiu  milwaukee casualty insurance company mcic  security national insurance company snic  amtrust insurance company of kansas  inc aick and amtrust lloyd s insurance company of texas alic were assigned a letter rating of a excellent by am best in these ratings have since remained unchanged 
an a rating is the rd highest of the categories used by am best  and is assigned to companies that have  in am best s opinion  an excellent ability to meet their ongoing obligations to policyholders 
these ratings were derived from an in depth evaluation of our subsidiaries balance sheets strengths  operating performances and business profiles

table of contents regulation general the business of insurance and reinsurance is regulated in most countries  although the degree and type of regulation vary significantly from one jurisdiction to another 
we are subject to extensive regulation in the united states and the european union especially  ireland and england and are also subject to regulation in bermuda 
united states we have eight operating insurance subsidiaries domiciled in the united states ric  tic  wic  aiic  mcic  snic  aick and alic the us insurance subsidiaries 
holding company regulation nearly all states have enacted legislation that regulates insurance holding company systems 
we qualify as a holding company system under such regulations 
each insurance company in a holding company system is required to register with the insurance supervisory agency of its state of domicile and periodically furnish information concerning the operations and transactions of companies within the holding company system that may materially affect the operations  management or financial condition of the insurers within the system 
these laws require disclosure of material transactions within the holding company system as well as prior notice of or approval for certain transactions  including  among other things  a the payment of certain dividends  b cost sharing agreements  c intercompany agency  service or management agreements  d acquisition of control of or merger with domestic insurers  e sales  purchases  exchanges  loans or extensions of credit  guarantees or investments if such transactions are equal to or exceed certain thresholds  and f reinsurance agreements 
all transactions within a holding company system affecting an insurer must have fair and reasonable terms and are subject to other standards and requirements established by law and regulation 
change of control the insurance holding company laws of nearly all states require advance approval by the respective state insurance departments of any change of control of an insurer 
control is generally defined as the possession  direct or indirect  of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of the company  whether through the ownership of voting securities  by contract except a commercial contract for goods or non management services or otherwise 
control is generally presumed to exist through the direct or indirect ownership of or more of the voting securities of a domestic insurance company or any entity that controls a domestic insurance company 
in addition  insurance laws in many states contain provisions that require pre notification to the insurance commissioners of a change of control of certain non domestic insurance companies licensed in those states  as well as post notification of a change of control of certain agencies and third party administrators 
any future transactions that would constitute a change of control  including a change of control of amtrust and or any of our us insurance subsidiaries  would generally require the party acquiring control to obtain the prior approval of the department of insurance in the state in which the insurance company being acquired is domiciled and in any other state in which the company may be deemed to be commercially domiciled by reason of concentration of our insurance business within such state and may also require pre notification in certain states 
obtaining these approvals may result in the material delay of  or deter  any such transaction 
these laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay  deter or prevent a change of control of amtrust  including through transactions  and in particular unsolicited transactions  that some or all of our stockholders might consider to be desirable 
state insurance regulation insurance companies are subject to regulation and supervision by the department of insurance in the state in which they are domiciled and  to a lesser extent  other states in which they are authorized to conduct business 
the primary purpose of such regulatory powers is to protect individual policyholders 
state 
table of contents insurance authorities have broad regulatory  supervisory and administrative powers  including  among other things  the power to a grant and revoke licenses to transact business  b set the standards of solvency to be met and maintained  c determine the nature of  and limitations on  investments and dividends  d approve policy rules  rates and forms prior to issuance and e regulate marketing  unfair trade  claims and fraud prevention and investigation practices 
in particular  the us insurance subsidiaries commercial policy rates and forms  including workers compensation policies  are closely regulated in all states 
workers compensation insurers are also subject to regulation by the specific workers compensation regulators in the states in which they provide such insurance 
our us insurance subsidiaries are required to file detailed financial statements and other reports with the departments of insurance in all states in which they are licensed to transact business 
these financial statements are subject to periodic examination by the department of insurance in each state in which they are filed 
in addition  many states have laws and regulations that limit an insurer s ability to withdraw from a particular market 
for example  states may limit an insurer s ability to cancel or not renew policies 
furthermore  certain states prohibit an insurer from withdrawing from one or more lines of business written in the state  except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department 
the state insurance department may disapprove any proposed plan that may lead to market disruption 
laws and regulations that limit cancellation and non renewal and that subject program withdrawals to prior approval requirements may restrict the ability of our us insurance subsidiaries to exit unprofitable markets 
insurance producers  third party administrators  claims adjusters and service contract providers and administrators are subject to licensing requirements and regulation by insurance regulators in various states in which they conduct business 
certain of our subsidiaries  including amtrust north america  inc ana  amtrust north america of florida  inc anafla  amt warranty corp  amtrust e s insurance services  inc  igi underwriting agency  inc  naxos avondale insurance  inc  risk services  llc and warrantech corporation are subject to licensing requirements and regulation by insurance regulators in various states 
federal and state legislative and regulatory changes from time to time  various regulatory and legislative changes have been proposed in the insurance industry 
among the proposals that have in the past been or are at present being considered are the possible introduction of federal regulation in addition to  or in lieu of  the current system of state regulation of insurers and proposals in various state legislatures some of which have been enacted to conform portions of their insurance laws and regulations to various model acts adopted by the national association of insurance commissioners naic 
in december  the naic adopted amendments to the model insurance holding company system regulation act and regulation the amended model act and regulation to introduce the concept of enterprise risk within an insurance company holding system 
if and when adopted by a particular state  the amended model act and regulation would impose more extensive informational requirements on us in order to protect the licensed insurance companies from enterprise risk  including requiring us to prepare an annual enterprise risk report that identifies the material risks within the insurance company holding system that could pose enterprise risk to the licensed insurer 
the amended model act and regulation must be adopted by the individual states  and specifically states in which our us insurance companies are domiciled  for the new requirements to apply to us 
it is not clear if and when such states will adopt these changes  however  if is anticipated that the naic will seek to make the amendments part of its accreditation standards for state solvency regulation  which would most likely motivate the states to adopt the amendments promptly 
the recent turmoil in the financial markets has increased the likelihood of changes in the way the financial services industry is regulated 
for example  the us federal government has increased its scrutiny of the insurance regulatory framework in recent years and  since january  the us treasury department  as part of its broad proposal to reform regulation of the financial services industry  has proposed legislation that would impact the insurance industry 
we are unable to predict whether any of these laws and regulations will be adopted  the form in which any such laws and regulations would be adopted or the effect  if any  these developments would have on our operations and financial condition 

table of contents on july   the president signed into law the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank act that established a federal insurance office within the us department of the treasury 
the federal insurance office initially is charged with monitoring all aspects of the insurance industry  gathering data  and conducting a study on methods to modernize and improve the insurance regulatory system in the united states 
a report on this study is required to be delivered to congress within months after enactment of the dodd frank act and could be influential in reshaping the current state based insurance regulatory system and or introducing a direct federal role in such regulation 
in addition  the dodd frank act gives the federal reserve supervisory authority over a number of financial services companies  including insurance companies  if they are designated by a two thirds vote of a financial stability oversight council as systemically important 
if an insurance company is designated as systemically important  the federal reserve s supervisory authority could include the ability to impose heightened financial regulation upon that insurance company and could impact requirements regarding its capital  liquidity and leverage as well as its business and investment conduct 
the dodd frank act also incorporates the non admitted and reinsurance reform act nrra  which will become effective on july  among other things  the nrra would establish national uniform standards on how states may regulate and tax surplus lines insurance and sets national standards concerning the regulation of reinsurance 
in particular  the nrra gives regulators in the state where an insurer is domiciled exclusive authority to regulate and tax surplus lines insurance transactions  and regulators in a ceding insurer s state of domicile the sole responsibility for regulating the balance sheet credit that the ceding insurer may take for reinsurance recoverables 
at the present time  it is unclear what effect the nrra changes specific to non admitted insurance and reinsurance will have on our operations and how these provisions of the dodd frank act will be implemented in practice 
the terrorism risk insurance act tria  as extended by the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act of tripra  requires that commercial property and casualty insurance companies offer coverage with certain exceptions  such as with respect to commercial auto liability for certain acts of terrorism and has established a federal assistance program through the end of to help such insurers cover claims for terrorism related losses 
tria covers certified acts of terrorism  and the us secretary of the treasury must declare the act to be a certified act of terrorism for it to be covered under this federal program 
in addition  pursuant to tripra  no certified act of terrorism will be covered by the tria program unless the aggregate insurance industry losses from the act exceed million 
under tripra  the federal government covers for acts of the losses from covered certified acts of terrorism on commercial risks in the united states only  in excess of a deductible amount 
this deductible is calculated as a percentage of an affiliated insurance group s prior year premiums on commercial lines policies with certain exceptions  such as commercial auto policies covering risks in the united states 
this deductible amount is of such premiums 
specific federal regulatory developments include the introduction of legislation in congress that would repeal the mccarran ferguson act antitrust exemption for the insurance industry 
the antitrust exemption allows insurers to compile and share loss data  develop standard policy forms and manuals and predict future loss costs with greater reliability  among other things 
the ability of the industry  under the exemption permitted in the mccarran ferguson act  to collect loss cost data and build a credible database as a means of predicting future loss costs is an important part of cost based pricing 
if the ability to collect this data were removed  the predictability of future loss costs and the reliability of pricing could be undermined 
state insurance department examinations as part of their regulatory oversight process  state insurance departments conduct periodic detailed financial examinations of insurance companies domiciled in their states  generally once every three to five years 
examinations are generally carried out in cooperation with the insurance departments of other states under guidelines promulgated by the naic 
currently  we have ongoing financial examinations of snic and alic by the texas department of insurance for the period ended december  examinations of the financial conditions of aick and ric were made as of december  by the kansas insurance department and the new york department of insurance  respectively 
examinations of the financial conditions of tic and wic were made as of december  by the new hampshire insurance department and delaware insurance department  respectively 
examinations of the financial condition of aiic and 
table of contents mcic were made by the each insurance company s respective state of domicile insurance department florida and wisconsin prior to our acquisition of these entities 
a second type of regulatory oversight examination of insurance companies involves a review by an insurance department of an authorized company s market conduct  which entails a review and examination of a company s compliance with laws governing marketing  underwriting  policy issuance  claims handling and other aspects of its insurance business during a specified period of time 
current ongoing market conduct examinations of our us insurance subsidiaries include separate examinations of wic by the california and missouri departments of insurance 
wic was also subject of a market conduct examination by the connecticut department of insurance for business conducted there from january  to december  guaranty fund assessments in most  if not all  of the states where we are licensed to transact business  there is a requirement that property and casualty insurers doing business within each such state participate in a guaranty association  which is organized to pay contractual benefits owed pursuant to insurance policies issued by impaired  insolvent or failed insurers 
these associations levy assessments  up to prescribed limits  on all member insurers in a particular state on the basis of the proportionate share of the premiums written by the member insurers in the lines of business in which the impaired  insolvent or failed insurer is engaged 
some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offsets 
property and casualty insurance company insolvencies or failures may result in additional guaranty association assessments to our us insurance subsidiaries at some future date 
at this time  we are unable to determine the impact  if any  such assessments may have on their financial positions or results of their operations 
as of december   each of our us insurance subsidiaries has established or will establish accruals for guaranty fund assessments with respect to insurers that are currently subject to insolvency proceedings 
residual market programs many of the states in which our us insurance subsidiaries conduct business or intend to conduct business require that all licensed insurers that provide workers compensation insurance participate in a program to provide workers compensation insurance to those employers that have not or cannot procure coverage from an insurer on a voluntary basis 
the level of required participation in such residual market programs of insurers is generally determined by calculating the volume of the voluntarily issued business in that state of the particular insurer as a percentage of all voluntarily issued business in that state by all insurers 
the resulting factor is the proportion of the premiums the insurer must accept as a percentage of all premiums for policies issued in that state s residual market program 
insurance companies generally can fulfill their residual market obligations by either issuing insurance policies to employers assigned to them  or participating in national and state reinsurance pools managed by the ncci where the results of all policies provided through these ncci pools are shared by the participating companies 
currently  our us insurance subsidiaries satisfy their residual market obligations by participating in the ncci pools 
none of our us insurance subsidiaries issues policies to employers assigned to them except to the extent that tic acts as a servicing carrier for workers compensation assigned risk plans in alabama  arkansas  illinois  indiana  georgia and kansas assigned risk plans 
coverage provided by the assigned risk plans is offered through servicing carriers  which issue policies to employers assigned to them by the assigned risk plan s administrator 
polices issued pursuant to the assigned risk plans are reinsured by the ncci pool  which are funded by assessments on insurers which write workers compensation insurance in the states which participate in the pools 
as noted above  tic acts as a servicing carrier for the assigned risk plans 
servicing carrier contracts are generally are awarded based on a competitive bidding process 
as a servicing carrier  we receive fee income for our services but do not retain any underwriting risk  which is fully reinsured by the ncci pools 
we began writing policies for the assigned risk plans effective january  
table of contents second injury funds a number of states operate trust funds that reimburse insurers and employers for claims paid to injured employees for aggravation of prior conditions or injuries 
these state managed trust funds are funded through assessments against insurers and self insurers providing workers compensation coverage in a particular state 
we received recoveries of approximately million  million and million from such state managed trust funds in  and  respectively 
the aggregate amount of cash we paid for assessments to state managed trust funds for the years ended december   and was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
risk based capital regulations our us insurance subsidiaries are required to report their risk based capital based on a formula developed and adopted by the naic that attempts to measure statutory capital and surplus needs based on the risks in the insurer s mix of products and investment portfolio 
the formula is designed to allow insurance regulators to identify weakly capitalized companies 
under the formula  a company determines its risk based capital by taking into account certain risks related to the insurer s assets including risks related to its investment portfolio and ceded reinsurance and the insurer s liabilities including underwriting risks related to the nature and experience of its insurance business 
at december   our us insurance subsidiaries risk based capital level exceeded the minimum level that would trigger regulatory attention 
insurance regulatory information system ratios the insurance regulatory information system  or iris  was developed by the naic and is intended primarily to assist state insurance departments in executing their statutory mandates to oversee the financial condition of insurance companies operating in their respective states 
iris identifies thirteen industry ratios and specifies usual values for each ratio 
departure from the usual values on four or more of the ratios can lead to inquiries from individual state insurance commissioners as to certain aspects of an insurer s business 
based upon calculations as of december   wic had four or more of its ratios falling outside the naic s usual ranges  with one falling outside the usual range due to a decline in investment yields  one falling outside the usual range due to an increase in net written premium  one falling outside the usual range as a result of premium growth and the resulting increase in liabilities  and three falling outside the usual range as a result of an intercompany reinsurance agreement whereby wic cedes to aii and tic and  respectively  of its subject premium 
statutory accounting principles statutory accounting principles  or sap  are a basis of accounting developed to assist insurance regulators in monitoring and regulating the solvency of insurance companies 
sap is primarily concerned with measuring an insurer s surplus to policyholders 
accordingly  statutory accounting focuses on valuing assets and liabilities of insurers at financial reporting dates in accordance with appropriate insurance law and regulatory provisions applicable in each insurer s domiciliary state 
gaap is concerned with a company s solvency  but is also concerned with other financial measurements  principally income and cash flows 
accordingly  gaap gives more consideration to appropriate matching of revenue and expenses and accounting for management s stewardship of assets than does sap 
as a direct result  different assets and liabilities and different amounts of assets and liabilities will be reflected in financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap as compared to sap 
statutory accounting practices established by the naic and adopted in part by the new york  new hampshire  delaware  florida  wisconsin  kansas and texas insurance regulators  determine  among other things  the amount of statutory surplus and statutory net income of ric  tic  wic  aiic  mcic  snic  aick and alic and thus determine  in part  the amount of funds that are available to pay dividends to amtrust 
privacy regulations in  congress enacted the gramm leach bliley act  which  among other things  protects consumers from the unauthorized dissemination of certain personal information 
subsequently  a majority of states have implemented additional regulations to address privacy issues 
certain aspects of these laws and regulations 
table of contents apply to all financial institutions  including insurance and finance companies  and require us to maintain appropriate policies and procedures for managing and protecting certain personal information of our policyholders 
we may also be exposed to future privacy laws and regulations  which could impose additional costs and impact our results of operations or financial condition 
in  the naic adopted the privacy of consumer financial and health information model regulation  which assisted states in promulgating regulations to comply with the gramm leach bliley act 
in  to further facilitate the implementation of the gramm leach bliley act  the naic adopted the standards for safeguarding customer information model regulation 
several states have now adopted similar provisions regarding the safeguarding of policyholder information 
we have established policies and procedures to comply with the gramm leach bliley related privacy requirements 
credit for reinsurance in addition to regulatory requirements imposed by the jurisdictions in which they are licensed  reinsurers business operations are affected by regulatory requirements in various states governing credit for reinsurance that are imposed on their ceding companies 
in general  a ceding company obtaining reinsurance from a reinsurer that is licensed  accredited or approved by the jurisdiction or state in which the ceding company files statutory financial statements is permitted to reflect in its statutory financial statements a credit in an aggregate amount equal to the ceding company s liability for unearned premiums which are that portion of premiums written which applies to the unexpired portion of the policy period  loss reserves and loss expense reserves ceded to the reinsurer 
aii  which reinsures risks of our us insurance subsidiaries  is not licensed  accredited or approved in any state in the united states 
the great majority of states  however  permit a credit to statutory surplus resulting from reinsurance obtained from a non licensed or non accredited reinsurer to be recognized to the extent that the reinsurer provides a letter of credit  trust fund or other acceptable security arrangement 
aii posts security to permit our us insurance subsidiaries to receive credit

risk factors you should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this report  including our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
risks related to our business during or following a period of disruption in the financial markets or economic downturn  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
the financial markets experienced significant volatility worldwide from the third quarter of through  and the united states and many other economies experienced a prolonged economic downturn  resulting in heightened credit risk  reduced valuation of investments and decreased economic activity 
while economic conditions have improved  uncertainty remains regarding the timing and strength of any economic recovery 
the trend toward recovery and growth may not continue 
even if growth continues  it may be at a slow rate for an extended period of time and other economic conditions  such as the residential and commercial real estate environment and employment rates  may continue to be weak 
although the us and foreign governments have taken various actions to try to stabilize the financial markets  it is unclear whether those actions will be effective and it is possible those actions could lead to an inflationary environment 
furthermore  financial markets may again experience significant disruption 
if economic conditions remain weak or deteriorate  or if financial markets experience significant disruption  it could materially adversely affect our results of operations  financial position and liquidity 
several of the risks we face  including those related to our investment portfolio  reinsurance arrangements  our estimates of loss reserves  emerging claim and coverage issues  the competitive environment and regulatory developments result from  or are made worse by  an economic slowdown or financial disruption 
many of these risks could materialize  and our financial results could be negatively impacted  even after the end of an economic downturn or financial disruption 
during or following an economic downturn  lower levels of economic activity could reduce and historically have reduced exposure changes at renewal 
in addition  because earned premiums lag written premiums  our results can be adversely affected even after general economic conditions have improved 
an inflationary environment which may follow government efforts to stabilize the economy may also adversely impact our loss reserves and could adversely impact the valuation of our investment portfolio 
finally  as a result of the financial market disruptions over the past three years  we may face increased regulation 
any or all of these reactions could adversely affect our business 
our loss reserves are based on estimates and may be inadequate to cover our actual losses 
we are liable for losses and loss adjustment expenses under the terms of the insurance policies we underwrite 
therefore  we must establish and maintain reserves for our estimated liability for loss and loss adjustment expenses with respect to our entire insurance business 
if we fail to accurately assess the risks associated with the business and property that we insure  our reserves may be inadequate to cover our actual losses 
we establish loss reserves that represent an estimate of amounts needed to pay and administer claims with respect to insured events that have occurred  including events that have occurred but have not yet been reported to us 
our loss reserves are based on estimates of the ultimate cost of individual claims and on actuarial estimation techniques 
these estimates are based on historical information and on estimates of future trends that may affect the frequency of claims and changes in the average cost of claims that may arise in the future 
they are inherently uncertain and do not represent an exact measure of actual liability 
judgment is required to determine the relevance of historical payment and claim settlement patterns under current facts and circumstances 
the interpretation of this historical data can be impacted by external forces  principally legislative changes  economic fluctuations and legal trends 
if there were unfavorable changes in our assumptions  our reserves may need to be increased 
any increase in reserves would result in a charge to our earnings 
in particular  workers compensation claims are often paid over a long period of time 
in addition  there are no policy limits on our liability for workers compensation claims as there are for other forms of insurance 
therefore  estimating reserves for workers compensation claims may be more uncertain than estimating reserves for other types of insurance claims with shorter or more definite periods between 
table of contents occurrence of the claim and final determination of the loss and with policy limits on liability for claim amounts 
accordingly  our reserves may prove to be inadequate to cover our actual losses 
if we change our reserve estimates for any line of business  these changes would result in adjustments to our reserves and our loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred in the period in which the estimates are changed 
if the estimate were increased  our pre tax income for the period in which we make the change will decrease by a corresponding amount 
an increase in reserves could result in a reduction in our surplus  which could result in a downgrade in our am best rating 
such a downgrade could  in turn  adversely affect our ability to sell insurance policies 
catastrophic losses or the frequency of smaller insured losses may exceed our expectations as well as the limits of our reinsurance  which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
property and casualty insurers are subject to claims arising from catastrophes 
catastrophes can cause losses in multiple property and casualty lines  including property and workers compensation 
workers compensation constitutes approximately of our business and we write commercial property insurance in our specialty program segment and our small commercial business segment 
the incidence and severity of catastrophes  such as hurricanes  windstorms and large scale terrorist attacks  are inherently unpredictable  and our losses from catastrophes could be substantial 
in addition  it is possible that we may experience an unusual frequency of smaller losses in a particular period 
in either case  the consequences could be substantial volatility in our financial condition or results of operations for any fiscal quarter or year  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations and our ability to write new business 
although we attempt to manage our exposure to these types of catastrophic and cumulative losses  including through the use of reinsurance  the severity or frequency of these types of losses may exceed our expectations as well as the limits of our reinsurance coverage 
if we do not accurately price our policies  our results of operations will be adversely affected 
in general  the premiums for our insurance policies are established at the time a policy is issued and  therefore  before all of our underlying costs are known 
like other insurance companies  we rely on estimates and assumptions in setting our premium rates 
establishing adequate premiums is necessary  together with investment income  to generate sufficient revenue to offset losses  loss adjustment expenses and other underwriting expenses and to earn a profit 
if we do not accurately assess the risks that we assume  we may not charge adequate premiums to cover our losses and expenses  which could reduce our net income and cause us to become unprofitable 
for example  when initiating workers compensation coverage on a policyholder  we estimate future claims expense based  in part  on prior claims information provided by the policyholder s previous insurance carriers 
if this prior claims information were incomplete or inaccurate  we may under price premiums by using claims estimates that are too low 
as a result  our actual costs for providing insurance coverage to our policyholders may be significantly higher than our premiums 
in order to accurately price our policies  we must collect and properly analyze a substantial volume of data from our insureds  develop  test and apply appropriate rating formulas  closely monitor and timely recognize changes in trends  and project both frequency and severity of our insureds losses with reasonable accuracy 
we also must implement our pricing accurately in accordance with our assumptions 
our ability to undertake these efforts successfully and  as a result  accurately price our policies  is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  principally insufficient reliable data  incorrect or incomplete analysis of available data  uncertainties generally inherent in estimates and assumptions  our inability to implement appropriate rating formulas or other pricing methodologies  
table of contents regulatory constraints on rate increases  unexpected escalation in the costs of ongoing medical treatment  our inability to accurately estimate investment yields and the duration of our liability for loss and loss adjustment expenses  and unanticipated court decisions  legislation or regulatory action 
our premium rates are established for the term of the policy 
consequently  we could set our premiums too low  which would negatively affect our results of operations and our profitability  or we could set our premiums too high  which could reduce our competitiveness and lead to lower revenues 
a downgrade in the am best rating of our insurance subsidiaries would likely reduce the amount of business we are able to write and could adversely impact the competitive positions of our insurance subsidiaries 
rating agencies evaluate insurance companies based on their ability to pay claims 
our domestic insurance subsidiaries  tic  ric  wic  aiic  mcic  snic  aick and alic  our irish subsidiary aiu  our united kingdom subsidiary  ael  and our bermuda subsidiary  aii  each currently has a financial strength rating of a excellent from am best  which is the rating agency that we believe has the most influence on our business 
this rating  which is the third highest of rating levels  is assigned to companies that  in the opinion of am best  have demonstrated an excellent overall performance when compared to industry standards and have an excellent ability to meet their ongoing obligations to policyholders 
the ratings of am best are subject to periodic review using  among other things  proprietary capital adequacy models  and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time 
our competitive position relative to other companies is determined in part by the am best rating of our insurance subsidiaries 
am best ratings are directed toward the concerns of policyholders and insurance agencies and are not intended for the protection of investors or as a recommendation to buy  hold or sell securities 
there can be no assurances that our insurance subsidiaries will be able to maintain their current ratings 
any downgrade in ratings would likely adversely affect our business through the loss of certain existing and potential policyholders and the loss of relationships with independent agencies that might move to other companies with higher ratings 
some of our policyholders are required to maintain workers compensation coverage with an insurance company with an am best rating of a excellent or better 
we are not able to quantify the percentage of our business  in terms of premiums or otherwise  that would be affected by a downgrade in our am best rating 
if market conditions cause our reinsurance to be more costly or unavailable  we may be required to bear increased risks or reduce the level of our underwriting commitments 
as part of our overall risk and capacity management strategy  we purchase quota share reinsurance and excess of loss and catastrophe reinsurance 
pursuant to our quota share reinsurance agreement with maiden insurance  it reinsures approximately of our net retained premiums the maiden quota share 
in addition  we purchase reinsurance on an excess of loss and catastrophe basis for protection against catastrophic events and other large losses 
market conditions beyond our control  in terms of price and available capacity  may affect the level of our business and profitability 
the maiden quota share has a three year term  which  subject to the occurrence of certain early termination events that permit either party to terminate on days written notice  will renew automatically for successive three year terms unless one of the parties notifies the other of its election not to renew not less than nine months prior to the expiration of any such three year term 
the current term expires june  our excess of loss and catastrophe reinsurance facilities are generally subject to annual renewal 
we may be unable to maintain our current reinsurance facilities  including the maiden quota share  or to obtain other reinsurance in adequate amounts and at favorable rates 
increases in the cost of reinsurance would adversely affect our profitability 
in addition  if we are unable to renew our expiring facilities or to obtain new reinsurance on favorable terms  either our net exposure to risk would increase or  if we are unwilling to bear an increase in net risk exposures  we would have to reduce the amount of risk we underwrite  which would reduce our revenues 

table of contents retentions in various lines of business expose us to potential losses 
we retain risk for our own account on business underwritten by our insurance subsidiaries 
the determination to reduce the amount of reinsurance we purchase or not to purchase reinsurance for a particular risk or line of business is based on a variety of factors  including market conditions  pricing  availability of reinsurance  the level of our capital and our loss history 
such determinations have the effect of increasing our financial exposure to losses associated with such risks or in such lines of business and  in the event of significant losses associated with such risks or lines of business  could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we may not be able to recover amounts due from our third party reinsurers  which would adversely affect our financial condition 
reinsurance does not discharge our obligations under the insurance policies we write  it merely provides us with a contractual right to seek reimbursement on certain claims 
we remain liable to our policyholders even if we are unable to make recoveries that we are entitled to receive under our reinsurance contracts 
as a result  we are subject to credit risk with respect to our reinsurers 
losses are recovered from our reinsurers after underlying policy claims are paid 
the creditworthiness of our reinsurers may change before we recover amounts to which we are entitled 
therefore  if a reinsurer is unable to meet its obligations to us  we would be responsible for claims and claim settlement expenses for which we would have otherwise received payment from the reinsurer 
if we were unable to collect these amounts from our reinsurers  our costs would increase and our financial condition would be adversely affected 
as of december   we had an aggregate amount of approximately million of recoverables from third party reinsurers on paid and unpaid losses

the asset management agreement has a one year term and will renew automatically for successive one year terms unless notice of intent not to renew is provided 
pursuant to the reinsurance brokerage agreement  we receive a brokerage commission equal to of the premium ceded to maiden insurance under the quota share reinsurance agreement 
there is no assurance that these arrangements will remain in place beyond their current terms and we may not be able to readily replace these arrangements if they terminate 
if we were unable to continue or replace these arrangements on equally favorable terms  our underwriting capacity and commission and fee income could decline  we could experience a downgrade in our am best rating  and our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 
we may not be able to successfully acquire or integrate additional business or manage the growth of our operations  which could make it difficult for us to compete and could negatively affect our profitability 
from time to time we may pursue additional acquisition opportunities if we believe that such opportunities are consistent with our long term objectives 
the process of integrating an acquired business or company can be complex and costly  and may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures 
there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully identify and acquire additional existing business on acceptable terms or that we will be successful in integrating any business that we acquire 
in addition  our growth strategy of expanding in our existing markets  opportunistically acquiring books of business  other insurance companies or producers  entering new geographic markets and further developing our relationships with independent agencies and extended warranty service contract administrators subjects us to various risks  including risks associated with our ability to identify profitable new geographic markets for entry  attract and retain qualified personnel for expanded operations  
table of contents identify  recruit and integrate new independent agencies and extended warranty service contract administrators  identify potential acquisition targets and successfully acquire them  expand existing agency relationships  and augment our internal monitoring and control systems as we expand our business 
we cannot assure you that we will effectively manage our growth or that any new business will be profitable 
if we are unable to manage our growth effectively  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
we rely on our information technology and telecommunications systems to conduct our business  and our success and profitability rely  in part  on our ability to continue to develop and implement technology improvements 
we depend in large part on our technology systems for conducting business and processing claims  and thus our business success is dependent on maintaining the effectiveness of existing technology systems and on continuing to develop and enhance technology systems that support our business processes and strategic initiatives in a cost and resource efficient manner 
some system development projects are long term in nature  may negatively impact our expense ratios as we invest in the projects and may cost more than we expect to complete 
in addition  system development projects may not deliver the benefits we expect once they are complete  or may be replaced or become obsolete more quickly than expected  which could result in accelerated recognition of expenses 
if we do not effectively and efficiently manage and upgrade our technology platform  or if the costs of doing so are higher than we expect  our ability to provide competitive services to new and existing customers in a cost effective manner and our ability to implement our strategic initiatives could be adversely impacted 
our business is also dependent upon the uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunication systems 
we rely upon our systems  as well as the systems of our vendors  to underwrite and process our business  make claim payments  provide customer service  provide policy administration services  such as endorsements  cancellations and premium collections  comply with insurance regulatory requirements and perform actuarial and other analytical functions necessary for pricing and product development 
our operations are dependent upon our ability to timely and efficiently process our business and protect our information and telecommunications systems from physical loss  telecommunications failure or other similar catastrophic events  as well as from security breaches 
while we have implemented business contingency plans and other reasonable and appropriate internal controls to protect our systems from interruption  loss or security breaches  a sustained business interruption or system failure could adversely impact our ability to process our business  provide customer service  pay claims in a timely manner or perform other necessary business functions 
likewise  a security breach of our computer systems could also interrupt or damage our operations or harm our reputation in the event confidential customer information is disclosed to third parties 
any of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition  operations or reputation 
if our businesses do not perform well  we may be required to recognize an impairment of our goodwill  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
goodwill represents the excess of the amounts we paid to acquire subsidiaries and other businesses over the fair value of their net assets at the date of acquisition 
we are required to perform goodwill impairment tests at least annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows 
if it is determined that the goodwill has been impaired  we would be required to write down the goodwill by the amount of the impairment  with a corresponding charge to net income 
such impairments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position 

table of contents our specialty risk and extended warranty business is dependent upon the sale by third parties of products covered by warranties and service contracts 
our specialty risk and extended warranty segment primarily covers manufacturers  service providers and retailers for the cost of performing their obligations under extended warranties and service contracts provided in connection with the sale or lease of various types of consumer electronics  automobiles  light and heavy construction equipment and other consumer and commercial products 
thus  any decrease in the sale or leasing of these products  whether due to economic factors or otherwise  is likely to have an adverse impact upon our specialty risk and extended warranty business 
we cannot influence materially the success of our specialty risk clients primary product sales and leasing efforts 
some of the largest purchasers of our specialty risk insurance products in the united states are manufacturers  service providers and retailers that issue extended warranties or service contracts for consumer and commercial grade goods  including coverage against accidental damage to the goods covered by the warranty or service contract 
we insure these policyholders against the cost of repairing or replacing such goods in the event of such accidental damage 
state insurance regulators may take the position that certain of the extended warranties or service contracts issued by our policyholders constitute insurance contracts that may only be issued by licensed insurance companies 
in that event  the extended warranty or service contract business of our policyholders may have to be restructured  which could adversely affect our specialty risk and extended warranty business 
if we cannot sustain our business relationships  including our relationships with independent agencies and third party warranty administrators  we may be unable to operate profitably 
our business relationships are generally governed by agreements with agents and warranty administrators that may be terminated on short notice 
we market our small commercial insurance primarily through independent wholesale and retail agencies 
except in connection with certain acquisitions  independent agencies generally are not obligated to promote our products and may sell insurance offered by our competitors 
as a result  our continued profitability depends  in part  on the marketing efforts of our independent agencies and on our ability to offer property and casualty insurance and maintain financial strength ratings that meet the requirements and preferences of our independent agencies and their policyholders 
we use third party claims administrators and other outside companies to underwrite policies and manage claims on our behalf for some portions of our business  including our specialty risk and extended warranty segment and our specialty program business segment 
we are dependent on the skills and performance of these parties  and we cannot control their actions  although we do provide underwriting guidelines and periodically audit their performance 
the loss of the services of these providers  or our inability to contract and retain other skilled service providers from a limited pool of qualified insurance service providers  could delay or prevent us from fully implementing our business strategy or could otherwise adversely affect us 
additional capital that we may require in the future may not be available to us  or only available to us on unfavorable terms 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including regulatory requirements  the financial stability of our reinsurers  future acquisitions and our ability to write new business and establish premium rates sufficient to cover our estimated claims 
we may need to raise additional capital or curtail our growth to support future operating requirements or cover claims 
if we have to raise additional capital  equity or debt financing may not be available to us or may be available only on terms that are not favorable  such as terms resulting in dilution to our stockholders or the securities sold may have rights  preferences and privileges senior to our currently issued and outstanding common stock 
in addition  under certain circumstances  we may sell our common stock  or securities convertible or exchangeable into shares of our common stock  at a price per share less than the market value of our common stock 
if we cannot obtain adequate capital on favorable terms or at all  we may be unable to support future growth or operating requirements and  as a result  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

table of contents the covenants in our credit facility limit our financial and operational flexibility  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition 
our syndicated credit facility contains covenants that limit our ability  among other things  to borrow money  make particular types of investments or other restricted payments  sell assets  merge or consolidate 
these covenants could restrict our ability to achieve our business objectives  and therefore  could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
in addition  this agreement also requires us to maintain specific financial ratios 
if we fail to comply with these covenants or meet these financial ratios  the lenders under our credit facility could declare a default and demand immediate repayment of all amounts owed to them  cancel their commitments to lend and or issue letters of credit 
if we were unable to realize our investment objectives  our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 
investment income is an important component of our net income 
we primarily manage our investment portfolio internally under investment guidelines approved by our board of directors and the boards of directors of our subsidiaries 
although these guidelines stress diversification and capital preservation  our investments are subject to a variety of risks  including risks related to general economic conditions  interest rate fluctuations  market volatility  various regulatory issues  credit risk  potential litigation  tax audits and disputes  failure to monetize in an effective and or cost efficient manner and poor operating results 
general economic conditions may be adversely affected by us involvement in hostilities with other countries and large scale acts of terrorism  or the threat of hostilities or terrorist acts 
we invest a small portion of our portfolio in below investment grade securities 
the risk of default by borrowers that issue below investment grade securities is significantly greater than that of other borrowers because these borrowers are often highly leveraged and more sensitive to adverse economic conditions  including a recession 
in addition  these securities are generally unsecured and often subordinated to other debt 
the risk that we may not be able to recover our investment in below investment grade securities is higher than with investment grade securities 
we may be forced to liquidate investments at times and prices that are not optimal  which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
investment losses could decrease our asset base and adversely affect our ability to conduct business and pay claims 
any significant decline in our investment income would adversely affect our revenues and net income and  as a result  decrease our surplus and stockholders equity 
a significant amount of our assets is invested in fixed income securities and is subject to market fluctuations 
our investment portfolio consists substantially of fixed income securities 
as of december   our investment in fixed income securities was approximately billion  or of our total investment portfolio 
the fair market value of these assets and the investment income from these assets fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions 
the fair market value of fixed income securities generally decreases as interest rates rise 
conversely  if interest rates decline  investment income earned from future investments in fixed income securities will decrease 
in addition  some fixed income securities  such as mortgage backed and other asset backed securities  carry prepayment risk as a result of interest rate fluctuations 
based upon the composition and duration of our investment portfolio at december   a basis point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of our investments of approximately million 
the value of investments in fixed income securities  and particularly our investments in high yield securities  is subject to impairment as a result of deterioration in the credit worthiness of the issuer or increases in market interest rates 
although we attempt to manage this risk by diversifying our portfolio and emphasizing preservation of principal  our investments are subject to losses as a result of a general decrease in commercial and economic activity for an industry sector in which we invest  as well as risks inherent in particular securities 
these conditions could result in lower than expected yields on our fixed securities and short term investment portfolio 
in addition  our investment in less liquid investments  such as our investment 
table of contents in acac  is subject to increased valuation uncertainty because the valuation is more subjective  thereby increasing the risk that the estimated fair value ie  the carrying cost does not reflect the price at which an actual transaction would occur 
we invest a portion of our investment portfolio in equity securities  which are subject to greater volatility than fixed income securities 
at december   our investments in equity securities were approximately million  or approximately one percent of our investment portfolio 
we reported unrealized losses at year end in the amounts of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
while we attempt to manage these risks through investment guidelines and other oversight mechanisms  our efforts may not be successful 
to a large degree  the credit risk we face is a function of the economy  accordingly  we face a greater risk in an economic downturn or recession 
as a result of the risks set forth above  the value of our investment portfolio could decrease  our net investment income could decrease  or we could experience realized and or unrealized investment losses  all of which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity 
we are subject to a number of risks associated with our business outside the united states 
we conduct business outside the united states primarily in the united kingdom  bermuda  italy  ireland  france  norway  luxembourg and canada 
while our business outside of the united states currently constitutes approximately of our gross written premium  we are subject to a number of significant risks in conducting such business 
these risks include restrictions such as price controls  capital controls  exchange controls and other restrictive government actions  which could have an adverse effect on our business and our reputation 
in addition  some countries have laws and regulations that lack clarity and  even with local expertise and effective controls  it can be difficult to determine the exact requirements of the local laws 
failure to comply with local laws in a particular market could have a significant and negative effect not only on our business in that market but also on our reputation generally 
our operating results may be adversely affected by currency fluctuations 
our functional currency is the us dollar 
for the years ended december   and  approximately  and  respectively  of our net premiums written were written in currencies other than the us dollar 
as of both december  and  approximately of our cash and investments were denominated in non us currencies 
we hold investments denominated in euros and british pounds because we write business in the eu and the united kingdom  and may  from time to time  experience losses resulting from fluctuations in the values of these non us currencies  which could adversely affect our operating results 
we may be subject to taxes on our luxembourg affiliates equalization reserves 
in  we acquired a luxembourg holding company and five luxembourg domiciled captive insurance companies with equalization reserves in the total amount of approximately million 
in  we acquired a luxembourg captive reinsurer with equalization reserves of approximately million 
an equalization reserve is a catastrophe reserve in excess of required reserves determined by a formula based on the volatility of the business ceded to the captive insurance company 
provided that we are able to cede losses to the captive insurance companies through intercompany reinsurance arrangements that are sufficient to exhaust the captives equalization reserves  luxembourg would not  under laws currently in effect  impose any income  corporation or profits tax on the captive insurance companies 
however  if the captive reinsurance companies were to cease reinsuring business without exhausting the equalization reserves  they would recognize income that would be taxed by luxembourg at a rate of approximately our business is dependent on the efforts of our principal executive officers 
our success is dependent on the efforts of our principal executive officers  barry d 
zyskind  ronald e 
pipoly  jr  michael saxon  christopher longo and max caviet  because of their industry expertise  knowledge of our markets and relationships with our independent agencies and warranty administrators 
although we have entered into employment agreements with all of our principal executive officers  should any of these executive officers cease working for us  we may be unable to find acceptable replacements with comparable skills and experience in the workers compensation insurance industry and or the specialty risk sectors that we 
table of contents target  and our business may be adversely affected 
we do not currently maintain life insurance policies with respect to our executive officers or other employees 
amtrust is an insurance holding company and does not have any direct operations 
amtrust is a holding company that transacts business through its operating subsidiaries 
our primary assets are the capital stock of these operating subsidiaries 
payments from our insurance company subsidiaries pursuant to management agreements and tax sharing agreements are our primary source of funds to pay our direct expenses 
we anticipate that such payments  together with dividends paid to us by our subsidiaries  will continue to be the primary source of our funds 
our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders largely depends upon the surplus and earnings of our subsidiaries and their ability to pay dividends to us 
payment of dividends by our insurance subsidiaries is restricted by insurance laws of various states  and the laws of certain foreign countries in which we do business ireland  england and bermuda  including laws establishing minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds  and could be subject to contractual restrictions in the future  including those imposed by indebtedness we may incur in the future 
as a result  at times  we may not be able to receive dividends from our insurance subsidiaries and may not receive dividends in amounts necessary to pay dividends on our capital stock 
as of december   our insurance subsidiaries could pay dividends to us of million without prior regulatory approval 
any dividends paid by our subsidiaries would reduce their surplus 
the inability of our operating subsidiaries to pay dividends and other permitted payments in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our cash requirements at the holding company level would have a material adverse effect on our operations 
aii may become subject to taxes in bermuda after march  the bermuda minister of finance  under the exempted undertakings tax protection act  as amended  of bermuda  has given aii an assurance that if any legislation is enacted in bermuda that would impose tax computed on profits or income  or computed on any capital asset  gain or appreciation  or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax  then the imposition of any such tax will not be applicable to aii or any of its operations  shares  debentures or other obligations until march  see business certain international tax considerations 
given the limited duration of the minister of finance s assurance  we cannot be certain that aii will not be subject to any bermuda tax after march  in the event that aii becomes subject to any bermuda tax after such date  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
risks related to our industry the property and casualty insurance industry is cyclical in nature  which may affect our overall financial performance 
historically  the financial performance of the property and casualty insurance industry has tended to fluctuate in cyclical periods of price competition and excess capacity known as a soft market followed by periods of high premium rates and shortages of underwriting capacity known as a hard market 
although an individual insurance company s financial performance is also dependent on its own specific business characteristics  the profitability of most property and casualty insurance companies tends to follow this cyclical market pattern 
we cannot predict with certainty the timing or duration of changes in the market cycle because the cyclicality is due in large part to the actions of our competitors and general economic factors beyond our control 
we experienced increased price competition in certain of our target markets during  and  and these cyclical patterns  the actions of our competitors  and general economic factors could cause our revenues and net income to fluctuate  which may cause the price of our common stock to be volatile 
negative developments in the workers compensation insurance industry would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
although we engage in other businesses  approximately of our gross written premium currently is attributable to workers compensation insurance 
as a result  negative developments in the economic  competitive or regulatory conditions affecting the workers compensation insurance industry could have an 
table of contents adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
for example  if legislators in one of our larger markets were to enact legislation to increase the scope or amount of benefits for employees under workers compensation insurance policies without related premium increases or loss control measures  this could negatively affect the workers compensation insurance industry 
negative developments in the workers compensation insurance industry could have a greater effect on us than on more diversified insurance companies that also sell many other types of insurance 
in florida  our second largest state for underwriting workers compensation insurance premiums  insurance regulators set the premium rates we may charge 
the florida insurance regulators may set rates below those that we require to maintain profitability 
for example  the florida office of insurance regulation oir approved overall average decreases in premium rates for all workers compensation insurance policies written by florida licensed insurers totaling approximately between and in november  the oir approved a rate increase effective for january  a decline in the level of business activity of our policyholders could negatively affect our earnings and profitability 
in  primarily all of our workers compensation gross premiums written were derived from small businesses 
because workers compensation premium rates are calculated  in general  as a percentage of a policyholder s payroll expense  premiums fluctuate depending upon the level of business activity and number of employees of our policyholders 
small businesses may be more vulnerable to changes in economic conditions because of their size 
we believe that the most common reason for policyholder non renewals is business failure 
as a result  our workers compensation gross premiums written are primarily dependent upon economic conditions where our policyholders operate 
we operate in a highly competitive industry and may lack the financial resources to compete effectively 
we compete with other insurance companies  and many of our existing and potential competitors are significantly larger  have longer operating histories  and possess greater financial  marketing and management resources than we do 
in our small commercial business segment  we also compete with individual self insured companies  state insurance pools and self insurance funds 
we compete on the basis of many factors  including coverage availability  responsiveness to the needs of our independent producers  claims management  payment settlement terms  premium rates  policy terms  types of insurance offered  overall financial strength  financial ratings and reputation 
if any of our competitors offer premium rates  policy terms or types of insurance that are more competitive than ours  we could lose market share 
there is no assurance that we will maintain our current competitive position in the markets in which we currently operate or that we will establish a competitive position in new markets into which we may expand 
the effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain 
as industry practices and legal  judicial  social and other environmental conditions change  unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge 
these issues may adversely affect our business by either extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims 
in some instances  these changes may not become apparent until after we have issued insurance policies that are affected by the changes 
as a result  the full extent of our liability under an insurance policy may not be known until many years after the policy is issued 
for example  medical costs associated with permanent and partial disabilities may increase more rapidly or be higher than we currently expect 
changes of this nature may expose us to higher claims than we anticipated when we wrote the underlying policy 
unexpected increases in our claim costs many years after policies are issued may also result in our inability to recover from certain of our reinsurers the full amount that they would otherwise owe us for such claims costs because certain of the reinsurance agreements covering our business include commutation clauses that permit the reinsurers to terminate their obligations by making a final payment to us based on an estimate of their remaining liabilities 
the effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are extremely hard to predict and could be harmful to our business and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

table of contents we are heavily regulated  and changes in regulation may reduce our profitability  limit our growth or restrict our ability to transact business 
our insurance company subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation in the jurisdictions in which they do business 
see business regulation for a discussion of the various types of regulation we face 
insurance regulation generally is intended to protect policyholders  not shareholders 
in the united states  insurance regulation generally is administered by each state through its state insurance department 
states regulate  among other things solvency  the lines of business we may transact  certain transactions between our insurance subsidiaries and affiliates  including us  the nature  quality and concentration of our investments  rates we may charge and the terms and conditions of our policy forms  and dividends paid by our insurance subsidiaries  although the us federal government has not historically regulated the insurance business  there have been proposals from time to time  including during and after the financial crisis in through  to impose federal regulation on the insurance industry 
on july   the president signed into law the dodd frank act  which is more fully described in business regulation dodd frank act 
these types of federal regulation could impose significant burdens on us  including impacting the ways in which we conduct our business  increasing compliance costs and duplicating state regulation  and could result in a competitive disadvantage  particularly relative to smaller insurers who may not be subject to the same level of regulation 
our non us subsidiaries are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which they operate 
in the event that a regulatory authority determines that we have failed to comply with regulatory requirements applicable to our business  we could be subject to actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business  such as fines  penalties or orders to cease transacting business 
furthermore  the enactment of new laws and regulations and changes in the interpretations of existing laws and regulations that are not yet contemplated could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the european union s executive body  the european commission  is implementing new capital adequacy and risk management regulations called solvency ii that would apply to our businesses across the european union including the united kingdom beginning as soon as the fourth quarter of under solvency ii  it is possible that the us parent of a european union subsidiary could be subject to certain solvency ii requirements if the regulator determines that the subsidiary s capital position is dependent on the parent company and the us company is not already subject to regulations deemed equivalent to solvency ii 
while it is not yet known how these actions will impact us  such regulation could result in a need for additional capital  increased costs of compliance  increased disclosure and less flexibility in our capital management 
regulators in bermuda and other jurisdictions in which we operate are also considering various proposals for financial and regulatory reform 
the future impact of such initiatives  if any  on our results of operations or our financial condition cannot be determined at this time 
we are unable to predict whether any of these laws and regulations will be adopted  the form in which any such laws and regulations would be adopted  or the effect  if any  these developments would have on our operations and financial condition 
we may have exposure to losses from terrorism for which we are required by law to provide coverage regarding such losses 
us insurers are required by state and federal law to offer coverage for terrorism in certain commercial lines  including workers compensation 
as discussed in business regulation federal and state legislative and regulatory changes  in response to the september  terrorist attacks  the united states congress enacted legislation designed to ensure  among other things  the availability of insurance 
table of contents coverage for foreign terrorist acts  including the requirement that insurers offer such coverage in certain commercial lines 
tria and tripra require commercial property and casualty insurance companies to offer coverage for certain acts of terrorism and established a federal assistance program through the end of to help such insurers cover claims related to future terrorism related losses 
the impact of any terrorist act is unpredictable  and the ultimate impact on us would depend upon the nature  extent  location and timing of such an act 
although we reinsure a portion of the risk we retain under the program  our terrorism reinsurance does not provide coverage for an act stemming from nuclear  biological or chemical terrorism 
our policies providing specialty risk and extended warranty coverage are not intended to provide coverage for losses arising from acts of terrorism 
accordingly  we have not obtained reinsurance for terrorism losses nor taken any steps to preserve our rights to the benefits of the tria program for this line of business and would not be entitled to recover from our reinsurers or the tria program if we were required to pay any terrorism losses under our specialty risk and extended warranty segment 
there have been no claims filed under the tria program as of yet  so there is still a great deal of uncertainty regarding how the federal government will implement the rules governing such claims 
it is possible that the fact that we have not taken steps to preserve our right to the benefits of the tria program for the us portion of our specialty risk and extended warranty segment may adversely affect our ability to collect under the program generally 
the federal terrorism risk assistance provided by tria and tripra will expire at the end of as a result of the above  there remains considerable uncertainty regarding the extent and adequacy of terrorism coverage that will be available to protect our interests in the event of future terrorist attacks 
any future renewal by congress may be on substantially less favorable terms 
the effects of the increasing amount of litigation on our business are uncertain 
although we are not currently involved in any material litigation with our customers  other members of the insurance industry are the target of class action lawsuits and other types of litigation  some of which involve claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts  and the outcomes of which are unpredictable 
this litigation is based on a variety of issues  including insurance and claim settlement practices 
we cannot predict with any certainty whether we will be involved in such litigation in the future or what impact such litigation would have on our business 
in addition  we have received inquiries from various attorney generals offices in connection with sales and customer refund issues associated with vehicle service contracts sold through independent marketers 
to our knowledge and understanding  the inquiries have also been directed to other entities in the industry that provide comparable services in connection with the offering of such vehicle service contracts 
we cannot predict the outcome of these inquiries  or the effect  if any  these inquiries or resulting litigation would have on our results of operations or financial condition 
risks related to our common stock our revenues and results of operations may fluctuate as a result of factors beyond our control  which may cause volatility in the price of our shares to common stock 
our common stock is listed on the nasdaq stock market under the symbol afsi 
our performance  as well as the risks we have discussed throughout this report  government or regulatory action  tax laws  interest rates and general market conditions could have a significant impact on the future market price of our common stock 
some of the factors that could negatively affect our share price or result in fluctuations in the price of our common stock include actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly results of operations  changes to our earnings estimates or publications of research reports about us or the industry  rising level of claims costs  changes in the frequency or severity of claims or new types of claims and new or changing judicial interpretations relating to the scope of insurance company liability  the financial stability of our third party reinsurers  changes in the level of reinsurance capacity  termination of reinsurance arrangements and changes in our capital capacity  increase in market interest rates that may lead purchasers of common stock to demand a higher yield  
table of contents changes in market valuations of other insurance companies  adverse market reaction to any increased indebtedness we incur in the future  fluctuations in interest rates or inflationary pressures and other changes in the investment environment that affects return on invested assets  additions or departures of key personnel  reaction to the sale or purchase of company stock by our principal stockholders or our executive officers  changes in the economic environment in the markets in which we operate  including reduction in the business activities of our policyholders  changes in tax law  speculation in the press or investment community  and general market  economic and political conditions 
if our revenues and results of operations fluctuate as a result of one or more of these factors  the price of our common stock may be volatile 
our principal stockholders have the ability to control our business which may be disadvantageous to other stockholders 
based on the number of shares outstanding as of december   barry d 
zyskind  michael karfunkel and george karfunkel  directly or indirectly  collectively own or control approximately of our outstanding common stock 
as a result  these stockholders  acting together  have the ability to control all matters requiring approval by our stockholders  including the election and removal of directors  amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  any proposed merger  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and other corporate transactions 
these stockholders may have interests that are different from other stockholders 
in addition  we are a controlled company as defined in nasd rule c 
at present  a majority of the members of our board of directors are independent 
as a controlled company  each of our board committees  except our audit committee  may include non independent directors 
the audit committee independence requirements imposed by the sarbanes oxley act of apply to us  and we have organized our audit committee to meet these requirements 
if we were to cease being a controlled company as a result of issuance of common stock by us or dispositions of common stock beneficially held by barry d 
zyskind  michael karfunkel and george karfunkel  we would have to comply with the board committee independence requirements of the nasdaq stock market within specified periods  which would involve having an entirely independent compensation committee and nominating and corporate governance committees within one year after ceasing to be a controlled company 
if we are unable to achieve compliance with these requirements  our common stock could be de listed from the nasdaq stock market 
in addition  michael karfunkel and george karfunkel  through entities that each of them control  have entered into transactions with us and may from time to time in the future enter into other transactions with us 
as a result  these individuals may have interests that are different from  or in addition to  their interest as our stockholders 
such transactions may adversely affect our results or operations or financial condition 
our principal stockholders could delay or prevent an acquisition or merger of our company even if the transaction could benefit other stockholders 
moreover  this concentration of share ownership makes it impossible for other stockholders to replace directors and management without the consent of the controlling stockholders 
in addition  this significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the price prospective buyers are willing to pay for our common stock because investors often perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies with controlling stockholders 

table of contents applicable insurance laws regarding the change of control of our company may impede potential acquisitions that our stockholders might consider to be desirable 
we are subject to state and foreign statutes and regulations that generally require that any person or entity desiring to acquire direct or indirect control of any of our insurance company subsidiaries obtain prior regulatory approval 
these laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay  deter or prevent a change of control of our company  including through transactions  and in particular unsolicited transactions  that some or all of our stockholders might consider to be desirable 
we may be unable to pay dividends on our common stock 
our income is generated primarily from our insurance subsidiaries 
the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends is regulated and under certain circumstances  restricted  pursuant to applicable law 
if our insurance subsidiaries could not pay dividends  we may not  in turn  be able to pay dividends to shareholders 
in addition  the terms of our junior subordinated debentures and credit agreement  in some circumstances  our ability to pay dividends on our common stock  and future borrowings may include prohibitions on dividends or other restrictions 
for these reasons  we may be unable to pay dividends on our common stock 
as of december   our insurance subsidiaries collectively could pay dividends to us of million without prior regulatory approval 
any dividends paid by our subsidiaries would reduce their surplus 
we have a history of paying dividends to our shareholders when sufficient cash is available 
however  future cash dividends will depend upon our results of operations  financial condition  cash requirements and other factors including the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions to us  which ability is restricted in the manner discussed above 
also  there can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends even if the necessary financial conditions are met and if sufficient cash is available for distribution

this complaint alleged that our transactions with maiden and maiden insurance unduly benefited michael karfunkel  george karfunkel and barry d

the complaint sought damages from the individual defendants  maiden and maiden insurance and judgment declaring the maiden transactions void 
on or about april   the defendants moved for summary judgment on the grounds that it was undisputed that the plaintiff  who did not acquire his amtrust shares until after the transactions that were the subject of his complaint  did not have standing to maintain the action 
on september   the court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants  dismissing all claims against the defendants except one claim  which the plaintiff agreed to discontinue on october  vehicle service contract industry inquiry the texas attorney general s office  along with other state attorney generals offices  has made an inquiry into the vehicle service contract industry focusing on former third party administrators of us fidelis 
the inquiries relate to the handling of payment of customer refunds in the absence of us fidelis fulfilling such obligations 
in connection with such inquiry  on or about january   our subsidiary  warrantech  received an inquiry from the texas attorney general s office because warrantech is a former third party administrator of us fidelis 
us fidelis was a direct marketer of vehicle service contracts and had a non exclusive relationship with warrantech from warrantech  along with other third party administrators  provided various vehicle service contract administration services in connection with contracts sold to customers by us fidelis through telemarketing efforts 
us fidelis filed for chapter bankruptcy protection in february and thereafter ceased vehicle service contract sales and support activities  including the provision of refunds to customers who previously purchased contracts 
warrantech is evaluating the inquiry and working with the texas attorney general to quantify the obligation and the potential exposure 
it is our understanding that this inquiry is part of a broader inquiry by the attorney generals made to all former third party administrators of us fidelis with regard to the handling of refund cancellations 
from time to time  we are involved in various legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business 
for example  to the extent a claim is asserted by an employee against his or her employer that is one of our insureds under a workers compensation policy  we are involved in the adjudication of the claim resulting from the workplace injuries 
these claims primarily relate to lost wages and medical expenses 
thus  when such a claim is submitted to us  in accordance with our contractual duty  we adjudicate the claim in accordance with the policy and the laws of the state where the claim is brought 
in addition to the claims arising from the policies we issue  as with any company actively engaged in business  from time to time  we may be involved in litigation involving non policyholders such as vendors or other third parties with whom we have entered into contracts and out of which disputes have arisen  or litigation arising from employment related matters  such as actions by employees claiming unlawful treatment or improper termination

payments from our insurance company subsidiaries pursuant to management agreements and tax sharing agreements are our primary source of funds to pay our direct expenses 
we anticipate that such payments  together with dividends paid to us by our subsidiaries  will continue to be the primary source of funds 
the ability to pay dividends to our stockholders largely depends upon the surplus and earnings of our subsidiaries and their ability to pay dividends to us 
payment of dividends by our insurance subsidiaries is regulated by insurance laws of various states  ireland and bermuda  and the laws of certain foreign countries in which we do business  including laws establishing minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds  and could be subject to contractual restrictions in the future  including those imposed by indebtedness we may incur in the future 
as a result  at times  we may not be able to receive dividends from its insurance subsidiaries and may not receive dividends in amounts necessary to pay dividends on our capital stock

aii a excellent reinsurance united states and european union bermuda insurance  particularly workers compensation  is  generally  affected by seasonality 
the first quarter generally produces greater premiums than subsequent quarters 
nevertheless  the impact of seasonality on our small commercial business and specialty program business segments has not been significant 
we believe that this is because we serve many small businesses in different geographic locations 
in addition  we believe seasonality may be muted by our acquisition activity 
one of the key financial measures that we use to evaluate our operating performance is return on equity 
our return on equity was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our overall financial objective is to produce a return on equity of or more over the long term 
in addition  we target a net combined ratio of or lower over the long term  while seeking to maintain optimal operating leverage in our insurance subsidiaries commensurate with our am best rating objectives 
our net combined ratio was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
a key factor in achieving our targeted net combined ratio is a continuous focus on our net expense ratio 
our strategy across our segments is to maintain premium rates  deploy capital judiciously  manage our expenses and focus on the sectors in which we have expertise  which we believe should provide opportunities for greater returns 
investment income is an important part of our business 
because the period of time between our receipt of premiums and the ultimate settlement of claims is often several years or longer  we are able to invest cash from premiums for significant periods of time 
our net investment income was million  million and million for the years ended  and  respectively 
we held and of total invested assets in cash and cash equivalents as of december  and  respectively 
this relatively high concentration of cash and cash equivalents represents our reaction to the relatively flat debt yield curve and should enable us to quickly redeploy substantial assets should the interest rate environment change 

table of contents our most significant balance sheet liability is our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expense 
we record reserves for estimated losses under insurance policies that we write and for loss adjustment expenses related to the investigation and settlement of policy claims 
our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses represent the estimated cost of all reported and unreported loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred and unpaid at any given point in time based on known facts and circumstances 
our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred and unpaid are not discounted using present value factors 
our loss reserves are reviewed at least annually by our external actuaries 
reserves are based on estimates of the most likely ultimate cost of individual claims 
these estimates are inherently uncertain 
judgment is required to determine the relevance of our historical experience and industry information under current facts and circumstances 
the interpretation of this historical and industry data can be impacted by external forces  principally frequency and severity of future claims  length of time to achieve ultimate settlement of claims  inflation of medical costs and wages  insurance policy coverage interpretations  jury determinations and legislative changes 
accordingly  our reserves may prove to be inadequate to cover our actual losses 
if we change our estimates  these changes would be reflected in our results of operations during the period in which they are made  with increases in our reserves resulting in decreases in our earnings

we and acac each initially contributed approximately million for our respective fifty percent ownership interest in tiger 
the third party serves as the administrator of the life settlement contract portfolio  for which it receives an annual fee 
under the terms of the agreement  the third party administrator is eligible to receive a percentage of profits after certain time and performance thresholds have been met 
we are responsible for certain actuarial and finance functions related to tiger 
additionally  in conjunction with our ownership percentage of acac  we ultimately receive of the profits and losses of tiger 
as such  in accordance with asc  consolidation  we have been deemed the primary beneficiary and  therefore  consolidate this entity 
in july  tiger acquired certain life insurance policies and cash value loans for approximately million 
we account for investments in life settlements in accordance with asc  investments in insurance contracts  which states that an investor shall elect to account for its investments in life settlement contracts by using either the investment method or the fair value method 
the election is made on an instrument by instrument basis and is irrevocable 
we have elected to account for these policies using the fair value method 
we determine fair value on a discounted cash flow basis of anticipated death benefits  incorporating current life expectancy assumptions  premium payments  the credit exposure to the insurance company that issued the life settlement contracts and the rate of return that a buyer would require on the contracts as no comparable market pricing is available 
the change in fair value  life insurance proceeds received and periodic maintenance costs  such as premium  necessary to keep the underlying policy in force  are recorded in other revenues on the consolidated statement of income 
we recorded a gain of approximately million upon initial acquisition of the life insurance policies 
our investments in life settlements and cash value loans were approximately million as of december  and are included in prepaid expenses and other assets on the consolidated balance sheet 
principal revenue and expense items gross written premium 
gross written premium represents estimated premiums from each insurance policy that we write  including as part of an assigned risk plan  during a reporting period based on the effective date of the individual policy 
certain policies that we underwrite are subject to premium audit at that policy s cancellation or expiration 
the final actual gross premiums written may vary from the original estimate based on changes to the final rating parameters or classifications of the policy 
net written premium 
net written premium is gross written premium less that portion of premium that we cede to third party reinsurers under reinsurance agreements 
the amount ceded under these reinsurance agreements is based on a contractual formula contained in the individual reinsurance agreement 
net earned premium 
net earned premium is the earned portion of our net written premiums 
we earn insurance premiums on a pro rata basis over the term of the policy 
at the end of each reporting period  premiums written that are not earned are classified as unearned premiums and are earned in subsequent periods over the remaining term of the policy 
our workers compensation insurance and commercial package policies typically have a term of one year 
thus  for a one year policy written on july  for an employer with a constant payroll during the term of the policy  we would earn half of the premiums in and the other half in we earn our specialty risk and extended warranty coverages over the estimated exposure time period 
the terms vary depending on the risk and have an average duration of approximately months  but range in duration from one month to months 
ceding commission revenues 
ceding commission is a commission we receive from ceding gross written premium to third party reinsurers 
in connection with the maiden quota share  which is our primary source of ceding commission  we receive a ceding commission of or  based on the business ceded 
we allocate earned ceding commissions to our segments based on each segment s proportionate share of total acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses recognized during the period 

table of contents net investment income and realized gains and losses 
we invest our statutory surplus funds and the funds supporting our insurance liabilities primarily in cash and cash equivalents  fixed maturity and equity securities 
our net investment income includes interest and dividends earned on our invested assets 
we report net realized gains and losses on our investments separately from our net investment income 
net realized gains occur when we sell our investment securities for more than their costs or amortized costs  as applicable 
net realized losses occur when we sell our investment securities for less than their costs or amortized costs  as applicable  or we write down the investment securities as a result of other than temporary impairment 
we classify equity securities and our fixed maturity securities as available for sale 
we report net unrealized gains losses on those securities classified as available for sale separately within accumulated other comprehensive income on our balance sheet 
service and fee income 
we currently generate service and fee income from the following sources product warranty registration and service our specialty risk and extended warranty business generates fee revenue for product warranty registration and claims handling services provided to unaffiliated third parties 
servicing carrier we act as a servicing carrier for the alabama  arkansas  illinois  indiana  georgia and kansas workers compensation assigned risk plans 
in addition  we also offer claims adjusting and loss control services for fees to unaffiliated third parties 
management services we provide services to insurance consumers  traditional insurers and insurance producers by offering flexible and cost effective alternatives to traditional insurance tools in the form of various risk retention groups and captive management companies  as well as management of workers compensation and commercial property programs

broker services we provide brokerage services to maiden in connection with our reinsurance agreement for which we receive a fee 
asset management services we currently manage the investment portfolios of maiden and acac for which we receive a management fee 
information technology services we provide information technology services to acac and its affiliates for a fee 
loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred 
loss and loss adjustment expenses lae incurred represent our largest expense item and  for any given reporting period  include estimates of future claim payments  changes in those estimates from prior reporting periods and costs associated with investigating  defending and servicing claims 
these expenses fluctuate based on the amount and types of risks we insure 
we record loss and loss adjustment expenses related to estimates of future claim payments based on case by case valuations and statistical analyses 
we seek to establish all reserves at the most likely ultimate exposure based on our historical claims experience 
it is typical for our more serious bodily injury claims to take several years to settle  and we revise our estimates as we receive additional information about the condition of injured employees and claimants and the costs of their medical treatment 
our ability to estimate loss and loss adjustment expenses accurately at the time of pricing our insurance policies is a critical factor in our profitability 
acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses 
acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses consist of policy acquisition expenses  salaries and benefits and general and administrative expenses 
these items are described below policy acquisition expenses comprise commissions directly attributable to those agents  wholesalers or brokers that produce premiums written on our behalf 
in most instances  we pay commissions based on collected premium  which reduces our credit risk exposure associated with producers in 
table of contents case a policyholder does not pay a premium 
we pay state and local taxes  licenses and fees  assessments and contributions to various state guaranty funds based on our premiums or losses in each state 
surcharges that we may be required to charge and collect from insureds in certain jurisdictions are recorded as accrued liabilities  rather than expense 
salaries and benefits expenses are those salaries and benefits expenses for employees that are directly involved in the origination  issuance and maintenance of policies  claims adjustment and accounting for insurance transactions 
we classify salaries and benefits associated with employees that are involved in fee generating activities as other expenses 
general and administrative expenses are comprised of other costs associated with our insurance activities  such as federal excise tax  postage  telephones and internet access charges  as well as legal and auditing fees and board and bureau charges 
other expense 
other expense includes those charges that are related to the amortization of tangible and intangible assets and non insurance fee generating activities in which we engage  including salaries and benefits expenses and other charges directly attributable to non insurance fee generating activities such as those generated by warrantech and risk services 
interest expense 
interest expense represents amounts we incur on our outstanding indebtedness at the then applicable interest rates 
income tax expense 
we incur federal income tax expense as well as income tax expense in certain foreign jurisdictions in which we operate 
net loss ratio 
the net loss ratio is a measure of the underwriting profitability of an insurance company s business 
expressed as a percentage  this is the ratio of net losses and lae incurred to net premiums earned 
net expense ratio 
the net expense ratio is a measure of an insurance company s operational efficiency in administering its business 
expressed as a percentage  this is the ratio of the sum of acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses less ceding commission revenue to net premiums earned 
as we allocate certain acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses based on premium volume to our segments  net loss ratio on a segment basis may be impacted period over period by a shift in the mix of net written premium 
net combined ratio 
the net combined ratio is a measure of an insurance company s overall underwriting profit 
this is the sum of the net loss and net expense ratios 
if the net combined ratio is at or above percent  an insurance company cannot be profitable without investment income  and may not be profitable if investment income is insufficient 
net premiums earned less expenses included in combined ratio underwriting income 
underwriting income is a measure of an insurance company s overall operating profitability before items such as investment income  interest expense and income taxes 
return on equity 
we calculate return on equity by dividing net income by the average of shareholders equity 
critical accounting policies it is important to understand our accounting policies in order to understand our financial statements 
these policies require us to make estimates and assumptions 
our management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of the estimates and assumptions we use with the audit committee of our board of directors 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of our assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related disclosures 
some of the estimates result from judgments that can be subjective and complex  and  consequently  actual results in future periods might differ significantly from these estimates 

table of contents we believe that the most critical accounting policies relate to the reporting of reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses  including losses that have occurred but have not been reported prior to the reporting date  amounts recoverable from third party reinsurers  assessments  deferred policy acquisition costs  deferred income taxes  the impairment of investment securities  goodwill and other intangible assets and the valuation of stock based compensation 
the following is a description of our critical accounting policies 
premiums 
we recognize insurance premiums  other than in our specialty risk and extended warranty segment  as earned on the straight line basis over the contract period 
insurance premiums on specialty risk and extended warranty business are earned based on estimated program coverage periods 
we base these estimates on the expected distribution of coverage periods by contract at inception  because a single contract may contain multiple coverage period options  and we revise these estimates based on the actual coverage periods selected by the insured 
unearned premiums represent the portion of premiums written that is applicable to the unexpired term of the contract or policy in force 
we base premium adjustments on contracts and audit premiums on estimates made over the contract period 
we also estimate an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a percentage of premium 
we review our bad debt write offs at least annually and adjust our premium percentage as required 
allowance for doubtful accounts were approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
ceding commission 
ceding commission is a commission we receive from ceding gross written premium to third party reinsurers 
we earn commissions on reinsurance premiums ceded in a manner consistent with the recognition of the direct acquisition costs of the underlying insurance policies  generally on a pro rata basis over the terms of the policies reinsured 
in connection with the maiden quota share  which is our primary source of ceding commission  the amount we receive is a blended rate based on a contractual formula contained in the individual reinsurance agreements  and the rate may not correlate specifically to the cost structure of our individual segments 
as such  we allocate earned ceding commissions to our segments based on each segment s proportionate share of total acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses recognized during the period 
reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses 
we record reserves for estimated losses under insurance policies that we write and for loss adjustment expenses related to the investigation and settlement of policy claims 
our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses represent the estimated cost of all reported and unreported loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred and unpaid at any given point in time based on known facts and circumstances 
in establishing our reserves  we do not use loss discounting  which would involve recognizing the time value of money and offsetting estimates of future payments by future expected investment income 
our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses are estimated using case by case valuations and statistical analyses 
we utilize a combination of our incurred loss development factors and industry wide incurred loss development factors 
our actuary generates a range within which it is reasonably likely that our ultimate loss and loss adjustment expenses for claims incurred in a particular time period  typically the calendar year  will fall 
the low end of the range is established by assigning a weight of to our ultimate losses obtained by application of our own loss development factors 
the high end is established by assigning a weight of each to our ultimate losses as developed through application of company and industry wide loss development factors 
the determination to assign particular weights to ultimate losses developed through application of our loss development factors and industry wide loss development factors is made by our actuary and is a matter of actuarial judgment 
in the selection of our reserves  we have given greater consideration over time to the results attributable to our own loss development factors 
we believe this method  by which we track the development of claims incurred in a particular time period  is the best method for projecting our ultimate liability 
loss development factors are dependent on a number of elements  including frequency and severity of claims  length of time to achieve ultimate settlement of claims  projected inflation of medical costs and wages for workers compensation  insurance policy coverage interpretations  judicial determinations and existing laws and regulations 
the predictive ability of loss development factors is dependent on consistent underwriting  claims handling  and inflation  among other factors  and predictable legislatively and judicially imposed legal requirements 
if all things remain equal  
table of contents losses incurred in should develop similarly to losses incurred in and prior years 
thus  if the net loss ratio for premiums written in year one is  we expect that the net loss ratio for premiums written in year two also would be 
however  due to the inherent uncertainty in the loss development factors  our actual liabilities may differ significantly from our original estimates 
notwithstanding the inherent uncertainty  we have not experienced material variability in our loss development factors 
we believe that it is reasonably likely that we could experience a deviation in our loss and loss adjustment expense reserves due to changes in the elements that underlie loss development  such as claims frequency or severity 
for example  as of december   the average cost per workers compensation claim was  which was a increase over the claims severity from of  in  claims frequency number of claims per million of payroll increased to from  an increase of  for the period between and in the event of a increase in claims frequency as measured by our insureds payroll  which we believe is the most important assumption regarding our business  our loss reserves as of december  would be understated by million and would result in an after tax reduction in shareholders equity of million 
in the event of a increase in claim severity  which is the average incurred loss per claim  our loss and loss adjustment expense reserves would be understated by million and would result in an after tax reduction in shareholders equity of million 
on a quarterly basis  at a minimum  and in some cases more frequently  we review our reserves to determine whether they are consistent with our actual results 
in the event of a discrepancy  we would seek to determine the causes underwriting  claims  inflation  regulatory and would adjust our reserves accordingly 
for example  if the development of our total incurred losses were greater than the loss development factors would have predicted  we would adjust our reserves for the periods in question 
in  we recognized a million redundancy 
in  our liabilities for unpaid losses and lae attributable to prior years decreased by million as result of favorable development in the small commercial business segment  partially offset by unfavorable development from our involuntary participation in ncci pools 
in  our liabilities for unpaid losses and lae attributable to prior years increased by million as result of unfavorable loss development  in our specialty program segment 
we do not anticipate that we will make any material reserve adjustments  but will continue to monitor the accuracy of our loss development factors and adequacy of our reserves 
additional information regarding our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses can be found in risk factors and business loss reserves 
reinsurance 
we account for reinsurance premiums  losses and lae on a basis consistent with those used in accounting for the original policies issued and the terms of the reinsurance contracts 
we record premiums earned and losses incurred ceded to other companies as reductions of premium revenue and losses and lae 
we account for commissions allowed by reinsurers on business ceded as ceding commission revenue 
reinsurance recoverables relate to the portion of reserves and paid losses and lae that are ceded to other companies 
we remain contingently liable for all loss payments in the event of failure to collect from the reinsurer 
deferred policy acquisition costs 
we defer commission expenses  premium taxes and assessments as well as certain sales  underwriting and safety costs that vary with and are primarily related to the acquisition of insurance policies 
these acquisition costs are capitalized and charged to expense ratably as premiums are earned 
we may realize deferred policy acquisition costs only if the ratio of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves calculated on a discounted basis to the premiums to be earned is less than  as it historically has been 
if  hypothetically  that ratio were to be above  we could not continue to record deferred policy acquisition costs as an asset and may be required to establish a liability for a premium deficiency reserve 
assessments related to insurance premiums 
we are subject to various assessments and premium surcharges related to our insurance activities  including assessments and premium surcharges for state guaranty funds and second injury funds 
assessments based on premiums are generally paid within one year after the calendar year in which the policies are written 
assessments based on losses are generally paid within one year of when claims are paid by us 
state insurance regulatory agencies use state guaranty fund assessments to pay claims of policyholders of impaired  insolvent or failed insurance companies and the operating expenses of those agencies 
states use second injury funds to reimburse insurers and employers for claims paid to 
table of contents injured employees for aggravation of prior conditions or injuries 
in some states  these assessments and premium surcharges may be partially recovered through a reduction in future premium taxes 
earned but unbilled premium 
earned but unbilled premium ebub estimates the amount of audit premium for those policies that have yet to be audited as of the date of the quarter or year end 
workers compensation policies are subject to audit and the final premium may increase or decrease materially from the original premium due to revisions to actual payroll and or employee classification 
based on guidance in fasb asc as well as statement of statutory accounting principles  we determine ebub using statistically supported aggregate calculations based on our historical premium audit results 
we have not had a material adjustment as a result of actual premium audits materially differing from the estimates used in calculating ebub 
as of december   if the actual results of the future premiums audits were lower than the historical results used in calculating ebub  the result would be a decrease in ebub and net earned premium of million or million after tax 
if the actual results of the future premiums audits were higher than the historical results used in calculating ebub  the result would be an increase in ebub  and net earned premium of million or million after tax 
in calculating ebub  we consider our ability to collect the projected increased premium as well as those expenses associated with both the additional premium and return premium 
cash and cash equivalents 
cash and cash equivalents are presented at cost  which approximates fair value 
we consider all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents 
we maintain our cash balances at several financial institutions 
the federal deposit insurance corporation secures accounts up to  at these institutions 
management monitors balances in excess of insured limits and believes they do not represent a significant credit risk to us 
investments 
we account for our investments in accordance with asc  debt and equity securities  which requires that fixed maturity and equity securities that have readily determined fair values be segregated into categories based upon our intention for those securities 
in accordance with asc  we have classified our fixed maturity securities and equity securities as available for sale 
we may sell our available for sale securities in response to changes in interest rates  risk reward characteristics  liquidity needs or other factors 
we report fixed maturity securities and equity securities at their estimated fair values based on quoted market prices or a recognized pricing service  with unrealized gains and losses  net of tax effects  reported as a separate component of comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
we determine realized gains and losses on the specific identification of the investments sold 
quarterly  our investment committee committee evaluates each security that has an unrealized loss as of the end of the subject reporting period for other than temporary impairment otti 
the company generally considers an investment to be impaired when it has been in a significant unrealized loss position in excess of of cost if the issuer has a market capitalization of under billion and in excess of of cost if the issuer has a market capitalization of billion or more for over months 
in addition  the committee uses a set of quantitative and qualitative criteria to review our investment portfolio to evaluate the necessity of recording impairment losses for other than temporary declines in the fair value of our investments 
the criteria the committee primarily considers include the current fair value compared to amortized cost  the length of time the security s fair value has been below its amortized cost  specific credit issues related to the issuer such as changes in credit rating  reduction or elimination of dividends or non payment of scheduled interest payments  whether management intends to sell the security and  if not  whether it is not more than likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer of the security  including any specific events that may affect its operations or earnings  
table of contents the occurrence of a discrete credit event resulting in the issuer defaulting on material outstanding obligation or the issuer seeking protection under bankruptcy laws  and other items  including company management  media exposure  sponsors  marketing and advertising agreements  debt restructurings  regulatory changes  acquisitions and dispositions  pending litigation  distribution agreements and general industry trends 
impairment of investment securities results in a charge to operations when a market decline below cost is deemed to be other than temporary 
we write down investments immediately that we consider to be impaired based on the above criteria collectively 
based on guidance in fasb asc  in the event of the decline in fair value of a debt security  a holder of that security that does not intend to sell the debt security and for whom it is not more than likely than not that such holder will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis  is required to separate the decline in fair value into a the amount representing the credit loss and b the amount related to other factors 
the amount of total decline in fair value related to the credit loss shall be recognized in earnings as an otti with the amount related to other factors recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss net loss  net of tax 
otti credit losses result in a permanent reduction of the cost basis of the underlying investment 
the determination of otti is a subjective process  and different judgments and assumptions could affect the timing of the loss realization 
during  and  we recorded impairment write downs of million  million and million  respectively after determining that certain of our investments were otti 
life settlements when we become the owner of a life insurance policy either by direct purchase or following a default on a premium finance loan  the life insurance premium for such policy is accounted for as an investment in life settlements 
investments in life settlements are accounted for in accordance with asc  investments in insurance contracts  which states that an investor shall elect to account for its investments in life settlement contracts using either the investment method or the fair value method 
the election is made on an instrument by instrument basis and is irrevocable 
we have elected to account for these investments using the fair value method 
goodwill and intangible assets we account for goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with asc  business combinations and asc  intangibles goodwill and other 
we record a purchase price paid that is in excess of net assets goodwill arising from a business combination as an asset  and it is not amortized 
we amortize intangible assets with a finite life over the estimated useful life of the asset 
we do not amortize intangible assets with an indefinite useful life 
we test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
if the goodwill or intangible asset is impaired  it is written down to its realizable value with a corresponding expense reflected in the consolidated statement of operations 
income taxes we join our domestic subsidiaries in the filing of a consolidated federal income tax return and are party to federal income tax allocation agreements 
under the tax allocation agreements  we pay to or receive from our subsidiaries the amount  if any  by which the group s federal income tax liability was affected by virtue of inclusion of the subsidiary in the consolidated federal return 
deferred income taxes reflect the impact of temporary differences between the amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and such amounts as measured by tax laws and regulations 
the deferred tax asset primarily consists of book versus tax differences for premiums earned  loss and loss adjustment expense reserve discounting  policy acquisition costs  earned but unbilled premiums  and unrealized holding gains and losses on marketable equity securities 
we record changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities that are associated with components of other comprehensive income  primarily unrealized investment gains and losses and foreign currency translation gains and losses  directly to other comprehensive income 
otherwise  we include changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities as a component of income tax expense 
in assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that we will generate future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  tax planning 
table of contents strategies and projected future taxable income in making this assessment 
if necessary  we establish a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized

we generally consider an investment to be impaired when it has been in a significant unrealized loss position in excess of of cost if the issuer has a market capitalization of under billion and in excess of of cost if the issuer has a market capitalization of billion or more for over months 
in addition  the committee uses a set of quantitative and qualitative criteria to review our investment portfolio to evaluate the necessity of recording impairment losses for other than temporary declines in the fair value of our investments 
the criteria the committee primarily considers include the current fair value compared to amortized cost  the length of time the security s fair value has been below its amortized cost  specific credit issues related to the issuer such as changes in credit rating  reduction or elimination of dividends or non payment of scheduled interest payments  whether management intends to sell the security and  if not  whether it is not more than likely than not that the company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer of the security  including any specific events that may affect its operations or earnings  the occurrence of a discrete credit event resulting in the issuer defaulting on material outstanding obligations or the issuer seeking protection under bankruptcy laws  and other items  including company management  media exposure  sponsors  marketing and advertising agreements  debt restructurings  regulatory changes  acquisitions and dispositions  pending litigation  distribution agreements and general industry trends 
impairment of investment securities results in a charge to operations when a market decline below cost is deemed to be other than temporary 
we write down investments immediately that we consider to be impaired based on the above criteria collectively

amounts in thousands equity securities    fixed maturity securities    in addition to the other than temporary impairment of million recorded during  at december   we had million of gross unrealized losses related to equity securities 
our investment in equity securities consists of investments in preferred and common stocks across a wide range of sectors 
we evaluated the near term prospects for recovery of fair value in relation to the severity and duration of the impairment and determined in each case that the probability of recovery is reasonable 
within our portfolio of common and preferred stocks  five equity securities comprised million  or  of the unrealized loss 
for the equity positions with gross unrealized losses there are five securities in various sectors  which currently include industrial  healthcare  consumer products and technology sectors  and have fair values of approximately   and of this portion our equity portfolio  respectively  and approximately   and of our unrealized losses  respectively 
the duration of these impairments ranges from one to ten months 
the remaining securities in a loss position are not considered individually significant and accounted for of our unrealized losses 
we believe these securities will recover and that we have the ability and intent to hold them until recovery 
at december   we had million of gross unrealized losses related to fixed income securities 
corporate bonds represent approximately of the fair value of our fixed maturities and approximately of the total unrealized losses of our fixed maturities 
we own corporate bonds in the industrial  financial and other sectors  which have a fair value of approximately  and  of our fixed maturity portfolio  respectively  and  and of total unrealized losses  respectively  of our fixed maturities 
we believe that the unrealized losses in these securities are the result  primarily  of general economic conditions and not the condition of the issuers  which we believe are solvent and have the ability to meet their obligations 
therefore  we expect that the market price for these securities should recover within a reasonable time

significant factors influencing our determination that unrealized losses were temporary included the magnitude of the unrealized losses in relation to each security s cost  the nature of the investment and management s intent not to sell these securities and it being not more likely than not that we will be required to sell these investments before anticipated recovery of fair value to our cost basis

liquidity and capital resources we are organized as a holding company with eleven insurance company subsidiaries insurance subsidiaries  as well as various other non insurance subsidiaries 
our primary liquidity needs include debt payments  interest on debt  taxes and shareholder dividends 
our income is generated primarily from our insurance subsidiaries and investment income 
we may generate liquidity through a combination of debt or equity securities issuances  as well as financing through borrowing and sales of securities 
in  we entered into a three year  million term loan 
additionally  in  we issued a four year  million note in conjunction with the ubi acquisition 
in january  we entered into a three year million credit facility which was initially used to pay off the remaining principal balance of the million term loan 
our principal sources of operating funds are premiums  investment income and proceeds from sales and maturities of investments 
our primary uses of operating funds include payments of claims and operating expenses 
currently  we pay claims using cash flow from operations and invest our excess cash primarily in fixed maturity and equity securities 
we expect that projected cash flow from operations will provide us sufficient liquidity to fund our anticipated growth  by providing capital to increase the surplus of our insurance subsidiaries as well as for payment of claims and operating expenses  payment of interest and principal on debt facilities and other holding company expenses until at least december  however  if our growth attributable to potential acquisitions  internally generated growth or a combination of these  exceeds our projections  we may have to raise additional capital sooner to support our growth

we presently expect to maintain sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our anticipated claim obligations and operating and capital expenditure needs 
our cash and investment portfolio has increased from  million excluding million of other investments at december  to  million excluding million of other investments at december  we do not anticipate selling securities in our investment portfolio to pay claims or to fund operating expenses 
should circumstances arise that would require us to do so  we may incur losses on such sales  which would adversely affect our results of operations and could reduce investment income in future periods 

table of contents comparison of years ended december  and net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in the decline in cash provided from operations resulted from a substantial increase in premium receivables of million  which resulted from writing more premiums in the specialty risk and extended warranty segment that generally has a longer policy life and therefore a longer cash collection cycle 
additionally  cash provided from operations decreased in as earnings from our equity investment in acac and gains from our investment in tiger capital  llc of million were non cash 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  in  major components of net cash provided by investing activities primarily included an equity investment in acac of million  acquisitions of warrantech and risk services of million  net purchases of investments for million and capital expenditures of million

the surplus lines facility will enable us to write business on a surplus lines basis throughout the united states  which we cannot  at present  do through our insurance subsidiaries 
currently  we are utilizing the surplus lines facility for two programs 
table of contents for which maiden specialty receives a five percent ceding commission on all premiums ceded by maiden specialty to tic 
the surplus lines facility shall remain continuously in force until terminated 
effective september   we  through our subsidiary  snic  entered into a reinsurance agreement with maiden reinsurance company and an unrelated third party 
under the agreement  which has a term of one year  snic will cede of the gross liabilities produced under the southern general agency program to maiden reinsurance company and of the gross liabilities produced to an unrelated third party 
snic receives a five percent commission on ceded written premiums 
the reinsurance agreement s impact on our results of operations  financial position or liquidity was immaterial for the year ended and as of december  reinsurance agreement with acac in conjunction with our strategic investment in acac and acac s acquisition from gmaci and mic s of gmac s us consumer property and casualty insurance business  which was completed on march  the acquisition  our subsidiary  tic  has entered into a quota share reinsurance agreement the personal lines quota share with the acquired gmac personal lines insurance companies gmac insurers by which tic assumes an amount equal to of the premium written by the gmac insurers  net of the cost of unaffiliated inuring reinsurance 
the personal lines quota share further provides that the gmac insurers receive a provisional ceding commission of of ceded written premiums 
the provisional premium is subject to adjustment based on results for the period march  through december  and for each month period thereafter based on the ratio of ceded losses to ceded premium  with a maximum commission of at loss ratios at or below decreasing dollar for dollar to a minimum commission of at a loss ratio at or above 
the personal lines quota share has an initial term of three years and will automatically renew for successive three year terms thereafter unless either tic or the gmac insurers notifies the other of its election not to renew not less than nine months prior to the end of any such three year term 
in addition  either party is entitled to terminate on days notice or less upon the occurrence of certain early termination events  which include a default in payment  insolvency  change in control of tic or gmac insurers  run off  or a reduction of or more of the shareholders equity 
the gmac insurers also may terminate on nine months written notice following the effective date of an initial public offering or private placement of stock by acac or a subsidiary 
the personal lines quota share is subject to a premium cap that limited the premium that could be ceded by the gmac insurers to tic to million during calendar year to the extent tic were to determine  in good faith  that it could not assume additional premium 
the premium cap increases by per annum thereafter

from january  through march   the american home reinsurance covered losses in excess of million per occurrence up to statutory coverage limits 
effective april   american home provided coverage in the amount of million in excess of million 
this additional coverage terminated on december  on a run off basis 
therefore  for losses occurring in that attached to a policy  the retention was million per occurrence 
effective january   american home increased its attachment to million per occurrence 
the excess of loss treaty that had an attachment of million was terminated on a run off basis on december  therefore  losses occurring in that attached to a policy were ceded to american home at an attachment point of million per occurrence 
we reevaluate our reinsurance programs annually or more frequently  as needed  and consider a number of factors  including cost of reinsurance  our liquidity requirements  operating leverage and coverage terms 
even if we maintain our existing retention levels  if the cost of reinsurance increases  our cash flow from operations would decrease as we would cede a greater portion of our premiums written to our reinsurers 
conversely  our cash flow from operations would increase if the cost of reinsurance declined relative to our retention

actual payments of loss and loss adjustment expenses by period will vary  perhaps materially  from the table above to the extent that current estimates of loss and loss adjustment expenses vary from actual ultimate claims amounts and as a result of variations between expected and actual payout patterns 
see risk factors risks related to our business our loss reserves are based on estimates and may be inadequate to cover our actual losses for a discussion of the uncertainties associated with estimating loss and loss adjustment expenses 
we are subject to various annual assessments imposed by certain of the states in which we write insurance policies 
these assessments are generally based upon the amount of premiums written or losses paid during the applicable year 
assessments based on premiums are generally paid within one year after the calendar year in which the policies are written  while assessments based on losses are generally paid within one year after the loss is paid 
when we establish a reserve for loss and loss adjustment expenses 
table of contents for a reported claim  we accrue our obligation to pay any applicable assessments 
if settlement of the claim is to be paid out over more than one year  our obligation to pay any related loss based assessments extends for the same period of time 
because our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses are based on estimates  our accruals for loss based insurance assessments are also based on estimates 
actual payments of loss and loss adjustment expenses may differ  perhaps materially  from our reserves 
accordingly  our actual loss based insurance assessments may vary  perhaps materially  from our accruals 
we are required by certain purchase agreements to pay the seller in the future based on the passage of time  volume of premium writings or a profitability metric 
also  we may be required by the terms of certain purchase agreements to pay the seller an annual minimum override payment based on a contractually defined formula 
the amount payable to the seller under these agreements could be materially higher if the premiums produced generate a higher payment than the calculated minimum payment 
we are required by certain agreements to pay fees based on profitability of certain subsidiary companies 
the company currently owns life settlement contracts and premium finance loans with a carrying value of million 
in order for the company to derive the economic benefit of the face value of the policies  the company is required to make these premium payments 
the interest related to the debt by period is as follows million less than year  million years  million years and million more than years 
in addition included within debt and interest is million related to the maiden collateral loan and million of associated interest 
inflation we establish property and casualty insurance premiums before we know the amount of losses and loss adjustment expenses or the extent to which inflation may affect such amounts 
we attempt to anticipate the potential impact of inflation in establishing our reserves  especially as it relates to medical and hospital rates where historical inflation rates have exceeded the general level of inflation 
inflation in excess of the levels we have assumed could cause loss and loss adjustment expenses to be higher than we anticipated  which would require us to increase reserves and reduce earnings 
fluctuations in rates of inflation also influence interest rates  which in turn impact the market value of our investment portfolio and yields on new investments 
operating expenses  including salaries and benefits  generally are impacted by inflation

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk 
market risk is the risk of potential economic loss principally arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
the major components of market risk affecting us are liquidity risk  credit risk  interest rate risk  foreign currency risk and equity price risk 
liquidity risk 
liquidity risk represents our potential inability to meet all payment obligations when they become due 
we maintain sufficient cash and marketable securities to fund claim payments and operations 
we purchase reinsurance coverage to mitigate the risk of an unexpected rise in claims severity or frequency from catastrophic events or a single large loss 
the availability  amount and cost of reinsurance depend on market conditions and may vary significantly 
credit risk 
credit risk is the potential loss arising principally from adverse changes in the financial condition of the issuers of our fixed maturity securities and the financial condition of our third party reinsurers 
we address the credit risk related to the issuers of our fixed maturity securities by investing primarily in fixed maturity securities that are rated bbb or higher by standard poor s 
we also independently monitor the financial condition of all issuers of our fixed maturity securities 
to limit our risk exposure  we employ diversification policies that limit the credit exposure to any single issuer or business sector 
we are subject to credit risk with respect to our third party reinsurers 
although our third party reinsurers are obligated to reimburse us to the extent we cede risk to them  we are ultimately liable to our policyholders on all risks we have ceded 
as a result  reinsurance contracts do not limit our ultimate obligations to pay claims covered under the insurance policies we issue and we might not collect amounts recoverable from our reinsurers 
we address this credit risk by selecting reinsurers which have an am best rating of a excellent or better at the time we enter into the agreement and by performing  along with our reinsurance 
table of contents broker  periodic credit reviews of our reinsurers 
if one of our reinsurers suffers a credit downgrade  we may consider various options to lessen the risk of asset impairment  including commutation  novation and letters of credit 
see reinsurance 
interest rate risk 
we had fixed maturity securities excluding million of time and short term deposits with a fair value of  million and a carrying value of  million as of december  that are subject to interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is the risk that we may incur losses due to adverse changes in interest rates 
fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on the market valuation of our fixed maturity securities 
we manage our exposure to interest rate risk through a disciplined asset and liability matching and capital management process 
in the management of this risk  the characteristics of duration  credit and variability of cash flows are critical elements 
these risks are assessed regularly and balanced within the context of our liability and capital position 
the table below summarizes the interest rate risk associated with our fixed maturity securities by illustrating the sensitivity of the fair value and carrying value of our fixed maturity securities as of december  to selected hypothetical changes in interest rates  and the associated impact on our stockholders equity 
we anticipate that we will continue to meet our obligations out of income 
we classify our fixed securities and equity securities as available for sale 
temporary changes in the fair value of our fixed maturity securities impact the carrying value of these securities and are reported in our shareholders equity as a component of other comprehensive income  net of deferred taxes 
the selected scenarios in the table below are not predictions of future events  but rather are intended to illustrate the effect such events may have on the fair value and carrying value of our fixed maturity securities and on our shareholders equity  each as of december

hypothetical change in interest rates fair value estimated change in fair value hypothetical percentage increase decrease in shareholders equity amounts in thousands basis point increase   basis point increase   no change  basis point decrease   basis point decrease   changes in interest rates would affect the fair market value of our fixed rate debt instruments but would not have an impact on our earnings or cash flow 
we currently have million of debt instruments of which million are fixed rate debt instruments 
a fluctuation of basis points in interest on our variable rate debt instruments  which are tied to libor  would affect our earnings and cash flows by million before income tax  on an annual basis  but would not affect the fair market value of the variable rate debt 
foreign currency risk 
we write insurance in the united kingdom and certain other european union member countries through aiu and ael 
while the functional currency of aiu and ael are  respectively  the euro and the british pound  we write coverages that are settled in local currencies  including  primarily  the euro and the british pound 
we attempt to maintain sufficient local currency assets on deposit to minimize our exposure to realized currency losses 
assuming a increase in the exchange rate of the local currency in which the claims will be paid and that we do not hold that local currency  we would recognize a million before tax realized currency loss based on our outstanding foreign denominated reserves of million at december equity price risk 
equity price risk is the risk that we may incur losses due to adverse changes in the market prices of the equity securities we hold in our investment portfolio  which include common stocks  non redeemable preferred stocks and master limited partnerships 
we classify our portfolio of equity securities as available for sale and carry these securities on our balance sheet at fair value 
accordingly  adverse changes in the market prices of our equity securities result in a decrease in the value of our total assets and a decrease 
table of contents in our shareholders equity 
as of december   the equity securities in our investment portfolio had a fair value of million  representing approximately one percent of our total invested assets on that date 
the table below illustrates the impact on our equity portfolio and financial position given a hypothetical movement in the broader equity markets 
the selected scenarios in the table below are not predictions of future events  but rather are intended to illustrate the effect such events may have on the carrying value of our equity portfolio and on shareholders equity as of december  the hypothetical scenarios below assume that our beta is when compared to the s p index
