the sapient approach our unique consulting methodology  sapient approach  is designed to address the biggest problems that most companies face when pursuing business enabling marketing  technology and other initiatives the majority of projects never finish  are completed late or over budget  lack promised capabilities  or contain unused functionality 
we employ a collaborative  agile lean based delivery approach  in which we develop and release in an iterative manner usable components of a deliverable  thus enabling our clients to review  validate and commence use of work product throughout the life cycle of a project  rather than await the end of the project to realize the project s full benefits 

table of contents while this delivery approach provides clients the most value and return on investment in the shortest possible time period  it also minimizes project risk because discrete pieces of work are tested and accepted throughout the project 
by contrast to traditional consulting services methods that require heavy up front investment in time and effort to define all possible requirements  our agile lean based methodology uses actual development to evaluate and improve the design as the project progresses 
this means that unnecessary steps or features are identified and eliminated early in the design and implementation process  dramatically reducing overall project cost 
sapient approach also enables us to commit to delivering our marketing services and other solutions within the price and schedule that we have promised to our clients  and to create solutions that bring together business  user  creative and technology requirements to solve our clients business problems 
we design these solutions to deliver tangible business value to clients  including increased revenues  reduced costs and more effective use of assets 
additionally  sapient approach integrates a creative methodology to design and create user experiences that are useful  usable and compelling 
our creative approach is highly iterative  and integrates input from a wide range of perspectives and disciplines 
this approach is highly scalable  and evolves based upon whether the creative output is intended to be a marketing campaign  a social media initiative  a website customer experience  a mobile application  or a retail experience 
through our creative approach we develop a deep understanding of the target user s needs  and synchronize the design of the user experience with agile delivery of the supporting technology to minimize risk and rework 
sapient approach also enables flexibility in selecting the process standardization and continuous improvement models that work best for each client 
our teams regularly incorporate six sigma  capability maturity model integration cmmi  international standards organization iso and information technology infrastructure library itil processes to ensure that appropriate rigor  discipline and accountability are built into each project 
by employing these industry leading techniques  our teams establish an enduring environment of process improvement that enables organizational capabilities essential to sustaining competitive business advantage

table of contents we organize our sales professionals primarily along our operating segments 
we believe that the industry and geographic focus of our sales professionals enhances their knowledge and expertise within their applicable segments and generates additional client engagements 
competition the markets for the services we provide are highly competitive 
we believe that we compete principally with large systems consulting and implementation firms  traditional and interactive advertising and marketing agencies  offshore consulting and outsourcing companies  and clients internal it departments 
to a lesser extent  we compete with boutique consulting firms that maintain specialized skills and or are geographically focused 
additionally  with respect to sapient government services  we both compete and partner with large systems integrators  major consulting firms with dedicated government business units  and government contractors 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in our markets include ability to solve business problems  ability to provide creative concepts and solutions  expertise and talent with advanced technologies  global scale  expertise in delivering complex projects through teams located in globally distributed geographies  availability of resources  quality and speed of delivery  price of solutions  industry knowledge  technology enabled marketing expertise  understanding of user experience  and sophisticated project and program management capability 
we also believe that we compete favorably when considering these factors and that our ability to deliver business innovation and outstanding value to our clients on time and on budget  our gdd model  our integrated marketing services capabilities and our successful track record in working with our clients distinguish us from our competitors 
intellectual property rights we rely upon a combination of trade secrets  nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements  and patent  copyright and trademark laws to protect our proprietary consulting methodology  custom developed software and other rights

risk factors risk factors the following important factors  among others  could cause our actual business  financial condition and future results to differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements made in this annual report or presented elsewhere by management from time to time 

table of contents our business  financial condition and results of operations may be materially impacted by economic conditions and related fluctuations in customer demand for marketing  business  technology and other consulting services 
the market for our consulting services and the technologies used in our solutions historically has tended to fluctuate with economic cycles particularly those cycles in the united states and europe  where we earn the majority of our revenues 
during economic cycles in which many companies are experiencing financial difficulties or uncertainty  clients and potential clients may cancel or delay spending on marketing  technology and other business initiatives 
our efforts to down size  when necessary  in a manner intended to mirror downturned economic conditions could be delayed and costly 
a downturn could result in reduced demand for our services  project cancellations or delays  lower revenues and operating margins resulting from price reduction pressures for our services  and payment and collection issues with our clients 
any of these events could materially and adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our markets are highly competitive and we may not be able to continue to compete effectively 
the markets for the services we provide are highly competitive 
we believe that we compete principally with large systems consulting and implementation firms  offshore outsourcing companies  interactive and traditional advertising agencies  and clients internal information systems departments 
to a lesser extent  other competitors include boutique consulting firms that maintain specialized skills and or are geography based 
regarding our government services practice  we both compete and partner with large defense contractors 
some of our competitors have significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources  and generate greater revenues and have greater name recognition  than we do 
often  these competitors offer a larger and more diversified suite of products and services than we offer 
these competitors may win client engagements by significantly discounting their services in exchange for a client s promise to purchase other goods and services from the competitor  either concurrently or in the future 
if we cannot keep pace with the intense competition in our marketplace  our business  financial condition and results of operations will suffer 
our international operations and global distributed delivery gdd model subject us to increased risk 
we have offices throughout the world 
our international operations are a significant percentage of our total revenues  and our gdd model is a key component of our ability to deliver our services successfully 
our international operations are subject to inherent risks  including economic recessions in foreign countries  fluctuations in currency exchange rates or impositions of restrictive currency controls  political instability  war or military conflict  changes in regulatory requirements  complexities and costs in effectively managing multi national operations and associated internal controls and procedures  significant changes in immigration policies or difficulties in obtaining required immigration approvals for international assignments  restrictions imposed on the import and export of technologies in countries where we operate  reduced protection for intellectual property in some countries  and changes in tax laws 
in particular  our gdd model depends heavily on our offices in gurgaon  bangalore and noida  india 
any escalation in the political or military instability in india or pakistan or the surrounding countries  or a business interruption resulting from a natural disaster  such as an earthquake  could hinder our ability to use gdd successfully and could result in material adverse effects to our business  financial condition and results of 
table of contents operations 
furthermore  the delivery of our services from remote locations causes us to rely on data  phone  power and other networks which are not as reliable in india as those in other countries where we operate 
any failures of these systems  or any failure of our systems generally  could affect the success of our gdd model 
remote delivery of our services also increases the complexity and risk of delivering our services  which could affect our ability to satisfy our clients expectations or perform our services within the estimated time frame and budget for each project 
changes to government structure or policies in countries in which we operate could negatively impact our operations if such changes were to limit or cease any benefits that may currently be available to us 
for example  although the indian government has historically offered generous tax incentives to induce foreign companies to base operations in india  new taxes have been introduced in recent years that partially offset those benefits 
on april  the income tax incentive of one of our software technology parks stps units in india expired 
beginning april   the income tax incentives applicable to our other two stps units in india are scheduled to expire 
in addition  in we established a new india unit in a special economic zone sez which is eligible for a five year  tax holiday 
this expiration of incentives may adversely affect our cost of operations and increase the risk of delivering our services on budget for client projects 
expiration of benefits provided to us by having operations based in india could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business  financial condition and results of operations may be materially impacted by military actions  global terrorism  natural disasters and political unrest 
military actions in iraq  afghanistan and elsewhere  global terrorism  natural disasters and political unrest in the middle east and other countries are among the factors that may adversely impact regional and global economic conditions and  concomitantly  client investments in our services 
in addition to the potential impact of any of these events on the business of our clients  these events could pose a threat to our global operations and people 
specifically  our people and operations in india could be impacted if the recent rise in civil unrest  terrorism and conflicts with bordering countries in india were to increase significantly 
as a result  significant disruptions caused by such events could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we do not attract and retain qualified professional staff  we may be unable to perform adequately our client engagements and could be limited in accepting new client engagements 
our business is labor intensive  and our success depends upon our ability to attract  retain  train and motivate highly skilled employees 
the improvement in demand for marketing and business and technology consulting services has further increased the need for employees with specialized skills or significant experience in marketing  business and technology consulting  particularly at senior levels 
we have been expanding our operations  and these expansion efforts will be highly dependent on attracting a sufficient number of highly skilled people 
we may not be successful in attracting enough employees to achieve our expansion or staffing plans 
furthermore  the industry turnover rates for these types of employees are high  and we may not be successful in retaining  training and motivating the employees we attract 
any inability to attract  retain  train and motivate employees could impair our ability to manage adequately and complete existing projects and to bid for or accept new client engagements 
such inability may also force us to increase our hiring of expensive independent contractors  which may increase our costs and reduce our profitability on client engagements 
we must also devote substantial managerial and financial resources to monitoring and managing our workforce and other resources 
our future success will depend on our ability to manage the levels and related costs of our workforce and other resources effectively 
we earn revenues  incur costs and maintain cash balances in multiple currencies  and currency fluctuations affect our financial results 
we have significant international operations  and we frequently earn our revenues and incur our costs in various foreign currencies 
our international service revenues were million for doing business in these foreign currencies exposes us to foreign currency risks in numerous areas  including revenues and receivables  purchases  payroll and investments 
as of december  of our assets and liabilities were subject to foreign currency exchange fluctuations 
we also have a significant amount of foreign currency operating income and net asset exposures 
certain foreign currency exposures  to some extent  are naturally offset within an 
table of contents international business unit  because revenues and costs are denominated in the same foreign currency  and certain cash balances are held in us dollar denominated accounts 
however  due to the increasing size and importance of our international operations  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could materially impact our financial results 
our gdd model also subjects us to increased currency risk because we incur a significant portion of our project costs in indian rupees and earn revenue from our clients in other currencies 
while we have entered into foreign currency offsetting option positions that allow the company partially to hedge certain short term translation exposures in indian rupee  british pound sterling and the euro currencies  and may in the future enter into foreign currency exchanges swaps and purchases as well as sales of foreign currency options  we will continue to experience foreign currency gains and losses in certain instances where it is not possible or cost effective to hedge foreign currencies 
there is no guarantee that such hedging activity will be effective or that our financial condition will not be negatively impacted by the currency exchange rate fluctuations of the indian rupee versus the us dollar 
costs for our delivery of services  including labor  could increase as a result of the decrease in value of the us dollar against the indian rupee  affecting our reported results 
our cash positions include amounts denominated in foreign currencies 
we manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds from our subsidiaries and the cost effectiveness with which these funds can be accessed 
the repatriation of cash balances from certain of our subsidiaries outside the united states could have adverse tax consequences and be limited by foreign currency exchange controls 
however  those balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations 
any fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  or changes in local tax laws  could materially impact the availability and size of these funds for repatriation or transfer 
we have significant fixed operating costs  which may be difficult to adjust in response to unanticipated fluctuations in revenues 
a high percentage of our operating expenses  particularly salary expense  rent  depreciation expense and amortization of intangible assets  are fixed in advance of any particular quarter 
as a result  an unanticipated decrease in the number or average size of  or an unanticipated delay in the scheduling for  our projects may cause significant variations in operating results in any particular quarter and could have a material adverse effect on operations for that quarter 
an unanticipated termination or decrease in size or scope of a major project  a client s decision not to proceed with a project we anticipated or the completion during a quarter of several major client projects could require us to maintain underutilized employees and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our revenues and earnings may also fluctuate from quarter to quarter because of such factors as the contractual terms and timing of completion of projects  including achievement of certain business results  any delays incurred in connection with projects  the adequacy of provisions for losses and bad debts  the accuracy of our estimates of resources required to complete ongoing projects  loss of key highly skilled personnel necessary to complete projects  and general economic conditions 
changes in our effective tax rate or tax liability may have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
our effective tax rate could be adversely impacted by several factors  some of which are outside our control  including changes in relative amounts of income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates  changes in tax laws and the interpretation of those tax laws  
table of contents changes to our assessments about the realizability of our deferred tax assets which are based on estimates of our future results  the prudence and feasibility of possible tax planning strategies and the economic environment in which we do business  the outcome of future tax audits and examinations  and changes in generally accepted accounting principles that affect the accounting for taxes 
in the ordinary course of our business  many transactions occur where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes 
although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable  the final determination could be materially different from our historical tax provisions and accruals 
our profits may decrease and or we may incur significant unanticipated costs if we do not accurately estimate the costs of fixed price engagements 
approximately of our projects are based on fixed price contracts  rather than contracts in which payment to us is determined on a time and materials or other basis 
our failure to estimate accurately the resources and schedule required for a project  or our failure to complete our contractual obligations in a manner consistent with the project plan upon which our fixed price contract was based  could adversely affect our overall profitability and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are consistently entering into contracts for large projects that magnify this risk 
we have been required to commit unanticipated additional resources to complete projects in the past  which has occasionally resulted in losses on those contracts 
we will likely experience similar situations in the future 
in addition  we may fix the price for some projects at an early stage of the project engagement  which could result in a fixed price that is too low 
therefore  any changes from our original estimates could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our profitability will be adversely impacted if we are unable to maintain our pricing and utilization rates as well as control our costs 
our profitability derives from and is impacted primarily by three factors  primarily i the prices for our services  ii our professionals utilization or billable time  and iii our costs 
to achieve our desired level of profitability  our utilization must remain at an appropriate rate  and we must contain our costs 
should we reduce our prices in the future as a result of pricing pressures  or should we be unable to achieve our target utilization rates and costs  our profitability could be adversely impacted and our stock price could decline materially 
we partner with third parties on certain complex engagements in which our performance depends upon  and may be adversely impacted by  the performance of such third parties 
certain complex projects may require that we partner with specialized software or systems vendors or other partners to perform our services 
often in these circumstances  we are liable to our clients for the performance of these third parties 
should the third parties fail to perform timely or satisfactorily  our clients may elect to terminate the projects or withhold payment until the services have been completed successfully 
additionally  the timing of our revenue recognition may be affected or we may realize lower profits if we incur additional costs due to delays or because we must assign additional personnel to complete the project 
furthermore  our relationships with our clients and our reputation generally may suffer harm as a result of our partners unsatisfactory performance 
our clients could unexpectedly terminate their contracts for our services 
most of our contracts can be canceled by the client with limited advance notice and without significant penalty 
a client s termination of a contract for our services could result in a loss of expected revenues and additional expenses for staff that were allocated to that client s project 
we could be required to maintain underutilized employees who were assigned to the terminated contract 
the unexpected cancellation or significant reduction in the scope of any of our large projects  or client termination of one or more recurring revenue contracts see 
table of contents explanation of long term and retainer revenues in part i  item  above  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may be liable to our clients for substantial damages caused by our unauthorized disclosures of confidential information  breaches of data security  failure to remedy system failures or other material contract breaches 
we frequently receive confidential information from our clients  including confidential customer data that we use to develop solutions 
if any person  including one of our employees  misappropriates client confidential information  or if client confidential information is inappropriately disclosed due to a breach of our computer systems  system failures or otherwise  we may have substantial liabilities to our clients or client customers 
further  many of our projects involve technology applications or systems that are critical to the operations of our clients businesses and handle very large volumes of transactions 
if we fail to perform our services correctly  we may be unable to deliver applications or systems to our clients with the promised functionality or within the promised time frame  or to satisfy the required service levels for support and maintenance 
while we have taken precautionary actions to create redundancy and back up systems  any such failures by us could result in claims by our clients for substantial damages against us 
although we attempt to limit the amount and type of our contractual liability for our breaches of confidentiality or data security  defects in the applications or systems we deliver or other material contract breaches that we may commit during the performance of our services collectively  contract breaches  in certain circumstances we agree to unlimited liability for contract breaches 
additionally  while we carry insurance that is intended to mitigate our liabilities for such contract breaches  we cannot be assured that our insurance coverages will be applicable and enforceable in all cases  or sufficient to cover substantial liabilities that we may incur 
further  we cannot be assured that contractual limitations on liability will be applicable and enforceable in all cases 
accordingly  even if our insurance coverages or contractual limitations on liability are found to be applicable and enforceable  our liability to our clients for contract breaches could be material in amount and affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  such claims may harm our reputation and cause us to lose clients 
our services may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties  and create liability for us as well as harm our reputation and client relationships 
the services that we offer to clients may infringe the intellectual property ip rights of third parties and result in legal claims against our clients and sapient 
these claims may damage our reputation  adversely impact our client relationships and create liability for us 
moreover  although we generally agree in our client contracts to indemnify the clients for expenses or liabilities they incur as a result of third party ip infringement claims associated with our services  the resolution of these claims  irrespective of whether a court determines that our services infringed another party s ip rights  may be time consuming  disruptive to our business and extraordinarily costly 
finally  in connection with an ip infringement dispute  we may be required to cease using or developing certain ip that we offer to our clients 
these circumstances could adversely impact our ability to generate revenue as well as require us to incur significant expense to develop alternative or modified services for our clients 
we may be unable to protect our proprietary methodology 
our success depends  in part  upon our proprietary methodology and other ip rights 
we rely upon a combination of trade secrets  nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements  and copyright and trademark laws to protect our proprietary rights 
we enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees  contractors  vendors and clients  and limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information 
we cannot be certain that the steps we take in this regard will be adequate to deter misappropriation of our proprietary information or that we will be able to detect unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce our ip rights 

table of contents our stock price is volatile and may result in substantial losses for investors 
the trading price of our common stock has been subject to wide fluctuations  particularly in the second half of and the first half of our trading price could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarterly variations in operating results and achievement of key business metrics by us or our competitors  changes in operating results estimates by securities analysts  any differences between our reported results and securities analysts published or unpublished expectations  announcements of new contracts or service offerings made by us or our competitors  announcements of acquisitions or joint ventures made by us or our competitors  and general economic or stock market conditions 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities 
the commencement of this type of litigation against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources 
certain of our directors have significant voting power and may effectively control the outcome of any stockholder vote 
jerry a 
greenberg  our former co chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer of the company and current member of our board of directors  and j 
stuart moore  our former co chairman of the board of directors and co chief executive officer and current member of our board of directors  own  in the aggregate  approximately of our outstanding common stock as of february  as a result  they have the ability to substantially influence and may effectively control the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors 
this concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of sapient  even if such a change in control would benefit other investors 
we are dependent on our key employees 
our success depends in large part upon the continued services of a number of key employees 
our employment arrangements with key personnel provide that employment is terminable at will by either party 
the loss of the services of any of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  if our key employees resign from sapient to join a competitor or to form a competing company  the loss of such personnel and any resulting loss of existing or potential clients to any such competitor could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
although  to the extent permitted by law  we require our employees to sign agreements prohibiting them from joining a competitor  forming a competing company or soliciting our clients or employees for certain periods of time  we cannot be certain that these agreements will be effective in preventing our key employees from engaging in these actions or that courts or other adjudicative entities will substantially enforce these agreements 
we may be unable to achieve anticipated benefits from acquisitions 
the anticipated benefits from any acquisitions that we may undertake might not be achieved 
for example  if we acquire a company  we cannot be certain that clients of the acquired business will continue to conduct business with us  or that employees of the acquired business will continue their employment or integrate successfully into our operations and culture 
the identification  consummation and integration of acquisitions and joint ventures require substantial attention from management 
the diversion of management s attention  as well as any difficulties encountered in the integration process  could have an adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
further  we may incur significant expenses in completing any such acquisitions  and we may assume significant liabilities  some of which may be unknown at the time of such acquisition 

table of contents the failure to successfully and timely implement certain financial system changes to improve operating efficiency and enhance our reporting controls could harm our business 
in parallel with the foregoing operational process redesign and role transition activities  we have implemented and continue to install several upgrades and enhancements to our financial systems 
we expect these initiatives to enable us to achieve greater operating and financial reporting efficiency and also enhance our existing control environment through increased levels of automation of certain processes 
failure to successfully execute these initiatives in a timely  effective and efficient manner could result in the disruption of our operations  the inability to comply with our sarbanes oxley obligations and the inability to report our financial results in a timely and accurate manner 
a failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could have a material adverse impact on the company 
we are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
we may in the future identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting 
further  because of its inherent limitations  internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements  regardless of the adequacy of such controls 
should we fail either to maintain adequate internal controls or implement required new or improved controls  our business and results of operations could be harmed  we may be unable to report properly or timely the results of our operations  and investors could lose faith in the reliability of our financial statements 
consequently  the price of our securities may be adversely and materially impacted

item legal proceedings we are subject to certain legal proceedings and claims  as discussed below 
we are also subject to certain other legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the course of business and that have not been fully adjudicated 
however  the results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty 
should the we fail to prevail in any of these legal matters or should several of these legal matters be resolved against us in the same reporting period  the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected 
we accrue contingent liabilities when it is probable that future expenditures will be made and such expenditures can be reasonably estimated 
we are subject to various legal claims totaling approximately million  for which the likelihood of a loss is considered more than remote  and various administrative audits each of which have arisen in the ordinary course of our business 
we have an accrual at december  of approximately million related to certain of these items 
we intend to defend these matters vigorously  although the ultimate outcome of these items is uncertain and the potential loss  if any  may be significantly higher or lower than the amounts that we have previously accrued

summary of results of operations our service revenues increased million  or  compared to this was due to an increase in demand for our services in all three of our primary business units 
compared geographically to  service revenue growth from clients in the united states increased compared to growth from our international 
table of contents clients 
service revenues also increased  to lesser extent  due to incremental service revenues from our nitro acquisition 
nitro s results of operations are reflected in ours as of the acquisition date  july  our income from operations increased million  or  compared to this increase is primarily due to higher margin service revenues less project personnel expenses compared to as we were able to maintain these expenses at of service revenues while service revenues grew 
in addition we also maintained selling and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue 
finally  operating income increased compared to the prior year as reflected more restructuring and acquisition related expenses as we had more activity of this nature in our net income decreased million  or  compared to this was due to a benefit of million from the release of our valuation allowance on our us deferred tax assets at the end of through the end of we had achieved sustained profitability in the us and this was the primary reason we released the valuation allowance on our us deferred tax assets 
please see our results of operations section for our discussion and analysis of these items 
in our service revenues decreased million  or  compared to the decrease in our service revenues was due to pricing pressures  and in the first half of  a decrease in demand for our services compared to these negative factors were a result of the overall economic downturn that began in the latter half of revenue also decreased due to currency fluctuations 
these decreases were partially offset by incremental service revenues from our nitro and dcg acquisitions 
dcg s results of operations are reflected in ours as of the acquisition date  august  our income from operations decreased million  or  compared to the decrease in operating income is primarily due to lower margin as a result of pricing pressures on our service revenues  causing margin to drop to of service revenues compared to in the increases in restructuring expenses  amortization expense and acquisition costs were offset by decreases in selling and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses 
our net income increased million  or  compared to the main reason for the increase in net income was the benefit of million from the release of our valuation allowance on our us deferred tax assets 
please see our results of operations section for our discussion and analysis of these items 

table of contents non gaap financial measures in our quarterly earnings press releases and conference calls we discuss two key measures that are not calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the first non gaap measure is operating income  as reported on our consolidated and condensed statements of operations  excluding certain expenses and benefits  which we call non gaap income from operations 
the second measure calculates non gaap income from operations as a percentage of reported services revenues  which we call non gaap operating margin 
we believe that non gaap measures help illustrate underlying trends in our business  and use the measures to establish budgets and operational goals  communicated internally and externally  for managing our business and evaluating our performance 
we exclude certain expenses from our non gaap operating income that we believe are not reflective of these underlying business trends or useful measures for determining our operational performance and overall business strategy 
these non gaap financial measures should be used in addition to and in conjunction with gaap results 
the following table reconciles income from operations as reported on our consolidated and condensed statements of operations to non gaap income from operations and non gaap operating margin for  and in thousands  except percentages twelve months ended december  service revenues gaap income from operations stock based compensation expense restructuring and other related charges amortization of purchased intangible assets acquisition costs and other related charges stock based compensation review and restatement benefit non gaap income from operations gaap operating margin effect of adjustments detailed above non gaap operating margin the increase in non gaap operating margin in compared to  as an amount and as a percentage of service revenues  is due to the increase in income from operations 
the decrease in compared to in both amount and percentage is due to the decrease in income from operations 
when important to management s analysis operating results are compared in constant currency terms  which excludes the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations  a non gaap measure 
the effect is excluded by translating the current period s local currency service revenues and expenses into us dollars at the average exchange rates of the prior period of comparison 
for a discussion of our exposure to exchange rates see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk summary of critical accounting policies  significant judgments and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
this requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
significant estimates relied upon in preparing these financial statements include estimated costs to complete long term contracts  estimated fair value of investments  including whether any decline in such fair value is other than temporary  estimated fair values of reporting units used to evaluate goodwill for impairment stock based compensation expenses  restructuring and other related charges  contingent liabilities and recoverability of our net deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances 
although management regularly assesses these estimates  actual results 
table of contents could differ materially from these estimates 
changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances a summary of those accounting policies  significant judgments and estimates that we believe are most critical to fully understanding and evaluating our financial results is set forth below 
this summary should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the provision of professional services  digital marketing services and offline printing and production services arrangements with our clients when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  services or product have been provided to the customer  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
in instances where the customer  at its discretion  has the right to reject the services or product prior to final acceptance  revenue is deferred until such acceptance occurs 
we recognize revenues from our fixed price and time and materials technology implementation consulting contracts using the percentage of completion method 
we use the percentage of completion method because the nature of the services provided in these contracts are similar to contracts that are required to use the percentage of completion per generally accepted accounting principles  like services provided by engineers and architects  for example 
revenues generated from fixed price and time and materials non technology implementation contracts  except for support and maintenance contracts  are recognized based upon a proportional performance model 
our percentage of completion method and our proportional performance method of accounting calculate revenue based on the percentage of labor incurred to estimated total labor 
this method is used because reasonably dependable estimates of the revenues and labor applicable to various stages of an arrangement can be made  based on historical experience and milestones set in the contract 
revenue from time and materials contracts is recognized as services are provided 
in situations where time and materials contracts require deliverables and provide for a ceiling on fees that can be charged  the arrangement is recognized as time and materials are incurred unless calculated fees are estimated to exceed the ceiling  in which case revenue recognition is based on the proportional performance method 
revenues generated from staff augmentation  support and maintenance contracts are recognized ratably over the arrangement s term 
our project delivery and business unit finance personnel continually review labor incurred and estimated total labor  which may result in revisions to the amount of recognized revenue under an arrangement 
certain arrangements provide for revenue to be generated based upon the achievement of certain performance standards 
revenue related to achieving such performance standards is recognized when such standards are achieved 
revenue related to the achievement of performance standards was immaterial for any of the periods presented in our consolidated financial statements 
revenues related to our digital marketing media sales are recorded as the net amount of our gross billings less pass through expenses charged to a client 
in most cases  the amount that is billed to clients significantly exceeds the amount of revenue that is earned and reflected in our financial statements  because of various pass through expenses such as production and media costs 
we are required to assess whether the agency or the third party supplier is the primary obligor 
we evaluate the terms of our client agreements as part of this assessment 
in addition  we give appropriate consideration to other key indicators such as latitude in establishing price  discretion in supplier selection and credit risk to the vendor 
because we broadly operate as an advertising agency based on our primary lines of business and given the industry practice to generally record revenue on a net versus gross basis  we believe that there must be strong evidence in place to overcome the presumption of net revenue accounting 
accordingly  we record revenue net of pass through charges when we believe the key indicators of the business suggest we generally act as an agent on behalf of our clients in our primary lines of business 
in those businesses where the key indicators suggest we act as a principal  we record the gross amount billed to the client as revenue 
our marketing services  including access to our bridgetrack software application  help our clients optimize their cross platform marketing effectively to track behavior and improve conversion rates through data driven 
table of contents analysis 
these services are provided in exchange for monthly retainer fees and license fees and are recognized as the monthly services are provided 
revenue from offline printing and production services are recognized at the time title of the related items transfers to our customers  provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
if we do not accurately estimate the resources required or the scope of work to be performed for an arrangement or we do not manage the project properly within the planned time period  then we may recognize a loss on the arrangement 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted arrangements are made on an arrangement by arrangement basis and are recognized in the period in which such losses are identified 
we have committed unanticipated additional resources to complete projects in the past  which has resulted in lower than anticipated profitability or losses on those arrangements 
we expect that we will experience similar situations in the future 
in addition  we may fix the price for some projects at an early stage of the process  which could result in a fixed price that is too low and  therefore  a corrected estimation could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we recognize revenue for services when collection from the client is reasonably assured  and our fees are fixed or determinable  provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
we establish billing terms at the time project deliverables and milestones are agreed 
our normal payment terms are thirty days from invoice date 
revenues recognized in excess of the amounts invoiced to clients are classified as unbilled revenues 
amounts invoiced to clients in excess of revenue recognized are classified as deferred revenues 
our project delivery and business unit finance personnel continually monitor timely payments from our clients and assess any collection issues 
valuation and impairment of investments and or marketable securities and other financial assets assessing whether a decline in value in available for sale securities is other than temporary requires us to assess whether we intend to sell the security and if it would be more likely than not that we would be required to sell the available for sale security before its cost can be recovered  for reasons such as contractual obligations or working capital needs 
also  we have to assess whether cost of the available for sale security will be recovered regardless of intent and or requirement to sell 
this assessment requires us to evaluate  among other factors the duration of the period that  and extent to which  the fair value is less than cost basis  the financial health of the business outlook for the issuer  including industry and sector performance  operational and financing cash flow factors and overall market conditions and trends 
assessing the above factors involves inherent uncertainty 
accordingly  declines in fair value  if recorded  could be materially different from the actual market performance of marketable securities in our portfolio  if  among other things  relevant information related to our marketable securities was not publicly available or other factors not considered by us would have been relevant to the determination of impairment 
effective january  we adopted new accounting standard stating that valuation techniques used to measure fair value under the current fair value standard must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
the standard describes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable  that may be used to measure fair value which are the following level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level inputs other than level that are observable  either directly or indirectly  such quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets and liabilities 

table of contents accounting for income taxes we record income taxes under the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective income tax bases  and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences  operating losses  or tax credit carry forwards are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we are required to establish a valuation allowance based on whether realization of deferred tax assets are considered to be more likely than not 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we evaluate the weight of all available evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
we reinvest certain earnings of foreign operations indefinitely and  accordingly  we do not provide for income taxes that could result from the remittance of such earnings 
when we can no longer assert indefinite reinvestment of foreign earnings we must provide for income taxes on these amounts 
accounting for income taxes requires a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if  based on the technical merits  it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the company reevaluates these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity 
any changes in these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 
we record interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes 
as of december  and  interest and penalties accrued were approximately million and million  respectively 
valuation of long lived assets and goodwill long lived assets are reviewed for impairment on a regular basis for the existence of facts and circumstances that may suggest that the carrying amount of an asset  or group of assets  may not be recoverable 
recoverability of long lived assets or groups of assets is assessed based on a comparison of the carrying amount to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
if estimated future undiscounted net cash flows are less than the carrying amount  the asset is considered impaired and expense is recorded at an amount required to reduce the carrying amount to fair value 
determining the fair value of long lived assets includes significant judgment by management  and different judgments could yield different results 
we assess the useful lives and possible impairment of long lived assets when an event occurs that may trigger such a review 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of or use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  identification of other impaired assets within a reporting unit  disposition of a significant portion of an operating segment  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and a decline in our market capitalization relative to net book value 
determining whether a triggering event has occurred includes significant judgment from management 

table of contents the goodwill impairment test requires us to identify reporting units and to determine estimates of the fair value of our reporting units as of the date we test for impairment 
assets and liabilities  including goodwill  were allocated to reporting units based on factors such as specific identification and percentage of revenue 
to conduct a goodwill impairment test  the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value 
if the reporting unit s carrying value exceeds its fair value  we record an impairment loss to the extent that the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
management estimates the fair value of the company s reporting units using the income approach  via discounted cash flow valuation models which include  but are not limited to  assumptions such as a risk free rate of return on an investment  the weighted average cost of capital of a market participant  and future revenue  operating margin  working capital and capital expenditure trends 
we performed the annual assessment of our goodwill during the fourth quarter of and determined that the estimated fair values of our reporting units significantly exceed their carrying value and  therefore  goodwill was not impaired 
we complete goodwill impairment analyses at least annually  or more frequently when events and circumstances  like the ones mentioned above  occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired 
determining fair value of reporting units and goodwill includes significant judgment by management and different judgments could yield different results 
restructuring and other related charges from time to time we establish exit plans for restructuring activities which require that we make estimates as to the nature  timing and amount of the exit costs that we specifically identified 
the consolidation of facilities requires us to make estimates  which included contractual rental commitments or lease buy outs for office space vacated and related costs  offset by estimated sub lease income 
we review on a regular basis our sub lease assumptions and lease buy out assumptions 
these estimates include lease buy out costs  anticipated sublease rates  other terms and conditions in sub lease contracts  and the timing of these sub lease arrangements 
if the rental markets continue to change  our lease buy out  sub lease and space requirement assumptions may not be accurate and it is possible that changes in these estimates could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our sub lease income estimates are sensitive to the level of sub lease rent anticipated and the timing of sub lease commencement 
if the estimated sub lease dates were to be delayed by six months  based on our current estimates  we would potentially have to recognize an additional million in our consolidated statement of operations for restructuring and other related charges 
a reduction in our sublease rate would have resulted in additional charges of approximately million as of the end of contingent liabilities we have certain contingent liabilities that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities 
we accrue contingent liabilities when it is probable that future expenditures will be made and such expenditures can be reasonably estimated 
we are subject to various legal claims totaling approximately million  for which the likelihood of loss is considered more than remote  and various administrative audits  each of which have arisen in the ordinary course of our business 
we have an accrual at december  of approximately million related to certain of these items 
we intend to defend these matters vigorously  although the ultimate outcome of these items is uncertain and the potential loss  if any  may be significantly higher or lower than the amounts we have accrued 
accounting for acquisitions we account for acquisitions completed after december  using the acquisition method 
the acquisition method requires us to recognize and measure identifiable assets acquired  liabilities assumed and any non controlling interest in the acquired entity 
our accounting for acquisitions involves significant judgments and estimates primarily  but not limited to the fair value of certain forms of consideration  the fair value of acquired intangible assets  which involve projections of future revenues and cash flows  the fair value of other acquired assets and assumed liabilities  including potential contingencies  and the useful lives and  as applicable  the reporting unit  of the assets 
the impact of prior or future acquisitions on our financial position or results of operations may be materially impacted by the change in or initial selection of assumptions and estimates 
acquisitions completed prior to january  are accounted for using the purchase method 
the purchase method and acquisition method are similar in many aspects  though the two most significant changes  as it pertains to our financial statements  are how the purchase method accounts for contingent consideration and transaction 
table of contents costs 
under the purchase method  contingent consideration is only recorded in the period in which the consideration is earned as goodwill in that period 
under the acquisition method we are required to estimate the fair value of contingent consideration as an assumed liability on the acquisition date by estimating the amount of the consideration and probability of the contingencies being met 
this estimate is recorded as goodwill on the acquisition date and its value is assessed at each reporting date 
any subsequent change to the estimated fair value is reflected in earnings and not in goodwill 
under the purchase method we were able to record transaction costs related to the completion of the acquisition as goodwill 
under the acquisition method we are required to expense these costs as they are incurred 
these costs are reflected in acquisition costs and other related charges on our consolidated statement of operations 
off balance sheet arrangements we have not created  and are not party to  any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital  incurring debt or operating parts of our business that are not consolidated into our financial statements

table of contents years ended december  and service revenues our service revenues for and were as follows in thousands  except percentages twelve months ended december  percentage increase increase service revenues service revenues increased due to an increase in demand for our services in all three of our primary business units 
compared geographically to  service revenue growth from clients in the united states increased compared to growth from our international clients see results by operating segment 
service revenues also increased  to lesser extent  due to incremental service revenues from our nitro acquisition 
the following table compares our service revenues by industry sector to in millions  except percentages percentage twelve months ended december  increase increase industry sector decrease decrease financial services consumer  travel automotive technology communications government  health education energy services total the increases in industry sector service revenues were due to an increase in demand for our services in these sectors  and to a lesser extent in the consumer  travel and automotive sector  incremental revenue from our nitro acquisition

our long term and retainer revenues were and of our global service revenues for and  respectively 
project personnel expenses project personnel expenses consist principally of salaries and employee benefits for personnel dedicated to client projects  independent contractors and direct expenses incurred to complete projects that were not reimbursed by the client 
these expenses represent the most significant costs we incur in providing our services 
twelve months ended december  percentage increase increase project personnel expenses project personnel expenses as a percentage of service revenues 
table of contents the increase in project personnel expense in was a direct result of our service revenue growth as we had to increase project personnel peoplecount  use of contractors and consultants and other direct expenses in order to support the increase in demand for our services 
compensation expenses increased million  primarily due to a increase in project personnel peoplecount 
contractor and consultant expense increased million as our need for contractors and consultants in specialized areas for certain client contracts increased 
travel expenses increased million to support revenue growth in addition to the fact that we made a concerted effort to manage these expenses in during the general economic downturn 
stock based compensation expense also increased million  primarily due to the increase in average stock price compared to finally  other project personnel expenses increased  in the aggregate  million 
selling and marketing expenses selling and marketing expenses consist principally of salaries  employee benefits and travel expenses of selling and marketing personnel  and promotional expenses 
twelve months ended december  percentage increase increase selling and marketing expenses selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of service revenues the increase in selling and marketing expenses was due to multiple factors i compensation expense increased million  primarily due to an increase in peoplecount  ii use of consultants increased million due to increased need for sales support in light of revenue growth  and iii other selling and marketing expenses increased  in the aggregate  million 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses relate principally to salaries and employee benefits associated with our management  legal  finance  information technology  hiring  training and administrative groups  and depreciation and occupancy expenses 
twelve months ended december  percentage increase increase general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses as a percentage of service revenues the increase in general and administrative expenses was due to multiple factors i facilities expenses increased million primarily due to our new special economic zone sez unit in india and moving into new office space in the united kingdom midway through  ii compensation expense increased million  iii consultant expense increased million  iv professional service fees such as agency fees and legal fees increased  in the aggregate  million due to an overall increase in peoplecount and corporate maintenance expenses  respectively  v travel expenses increased million due to internal projects and the fact that we made a concerted effort to manage these costs in during the general economic downturn  vi stock based compensation expense increased million due to incremental expense from the nitro acquisition and the increase of the company s average stock price compared to and vii health insurance costs increased million due to the overall increase in peoplecount 
finally  other general and administrative expenses increased  in the aggregate  million 
restructuring and other related charges restructuring and other related charges decreased million compared to due to two reasons 
first  we had a workforce restructuring where we recorded a million restructuring charge in the first quarter of second  we recorded a million charge in the third quarter o principally as a result of a change in estimated 
table of contents sub lease income associated with two previously restructured leases 
in we had one facility restructuring which resulted in a charge of only million which was offset by a benefit of million principally as a result of a change in estimated sub lease income associated with two previously restructured leases 
amortization of purchased intangible assets during and  purchased intangible assets consisted of non compete and non solicitation agreements  customer lists  and tradenames acquired in business combinations 
amortization expense related to intangible assets increased million due to the amortization of intangible assets acquired in the nitro acquisition  offset by a decrease in expense as the useful economic lives of other intangibles ended 
acquisition costs and other related charges on january   we began accounting for business combinations using the acquisition method which requires acquisition related costs to be expensed as incurred 
these costs include expenses associated with third party professional services we incur related to our evaluation process of potential acquisition opportunities and other related charges 
though we may incur acquisition costs and other related charges it is not indicative that any transaction will be consummated 
the reason why expenses decreased in is that the previous year reflected the bulk of expenses related to the nitro acquisition while we had no acquisitions in interest and other income interest and other income is derived primarily from investments in us government securities  bank time deposits  and money market funds 
twelve months ended december  percentage increase increase interest and other income  net interest and other income increased due to an increase in interest income as we had higher average cash balances compared to  and  to a lesser extent  an increase in interest rates 
provision for income taxes and benefit from release of valuation allowance our income tax is related to federal  state and foreign tax obligations 
the increase in our provision for income taxes is due to higher income before taxes and a higher tax rate on our us income due to the release of our valuation allowance on a substantial portion of our us deferred taxes in the fourth quarter of deferred tax assets are to be reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on the weight of available positive and negative evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
at december  all of our us deferred tax assets had a full valuation allowance of million 
based upon our operating results for the years immediately preceding and through december   as well as an assessment of our expected future results of operations in the us  at december  we determined that it had become more likely than not that we would realize a substantial portion of our deferred tax assets in the us as a result  we released our valuation allowances on a substantial portion of our us deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of certain state tax net operating loss carry forwards  as well as a portion of the net operating loss carry forwards relating to certain stock based compensation deductions will remain with a valuation allowance recorded against them at december  and at december  we determined that it had become more likely than not that we would realize a portion of our deferred tax assets related to state net operating loss carry forwards 
as a result  we released million of valuation allowances on our state deferred tax assets which was recorded as an income tax benefit 
in addition  at december  we established a valuation allowance of million against deferred tax assets in switzerland  but continue to believe that the deferred tax assets in other foreign subsidiaries are more likely than not to be realized and  therefore  no valuation allowance has been recorded against these assets 
we have gross unrecognized tax benefits  including interest and penalties  of approximately million as of december  and million as of december  these amounts represent the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that  if recognized  would result in a reduction of our effective tax rate 
we recognize 
table of contents interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes 
as of december  interest accrued was approximately million 
we conduct business globally and  as a result  one or more of our subsidiaries files income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions 
in the normal course of business we are subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world 
our effective tax rate may vary from period to period based on changes in estimated taxable income or loss by jurisdiction  changes to the valuation allowance  changes to federal  state or foreign tax laws  future expansion into areas with varying country  state  and local income tax rates  deductibility of certain costs and expenses by jurisdiction and as a result of acquisitions 
results by operating segment we have discrete financial data by operating segments available based on our method of internal reporting  which disaggregates our operations 
operating segments are defined as components of the company for which separate financial information is available to manage resources and evaluate performance 
beginning in  we realigned our north america and europe operating segments and internal reporting systems to better align our services with our business and operational strategy 
the new operating segments are sapientnitro new  sapient global markets new and sapient government services 
as such  results by operating segment for the twelve months ended december  and have been recast to reflect the operating segment unit structure 
we do not allocate certain marketing and general and administrative expenses to our business unit segments because these activities are managed separately from the business units 
we allocated million and million of million related to our first quarter reduction in workforce to our sapientnitro and sapient global markets segments  respectively 
we did not allocate the remaining million in costs associated with our restructuring activity or any costs associated with our   and restructuring events across our operating segments for internal measurement purposes because the substantial majority of these restructuring costs impacted areas of the business that supported the business units and  specifically in the case of our   and events  were related to the initiative to reengineer general and administrative activities and the consolidation of facilities 
management does not allocate stock based compensation to the segments for the review of results by the chief operating decision maker codm 
asset information by operating segment is not reported to or reviewed by the codm  and therefore  the company has not disclosed asset information for each operating segment

liquidity and capital resources during and we funded our operations with cash flows generated from operations 
we invest our excess cash predominantly in money market funds  time deposits with maturities of less than or equal to days  mutual funds and other cash equivalents 
at december  we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and marketable investments  compared to million at december  this increase was due to cash flow from operations of million  net of cash used in financing activities for our special dividend payment in the first quarter of of million and the purchase of property  plant and equipment

cash used by investing activities was million 
this was due to million in payments of deferred consideration related to the nitro acquisition  million in capital expenditures and the costs of internally developed software and million in purchases of marketable securities 
these uses of cash were offset by million in redemptions of available for sale marketable securities and the receipt of million on our hedge positions 
cash used by investing activities increased compared to the same period in due to the purchases of marketable securities 
though the current period reflected more capital expenditures  primarily related to build out costs for a new india unit discussed below  reflected more cash paid for acquisitions which related to nitro 
cash used by financing activities was million as a result of a million special dividend payment on all outstanding common stock as of march  as a return of capital to shareholders 
this was offset by million in proceeds associated with the issuance of common stock for stock option exercises and million in proceeds from our credit facility 
the difference between the financing activities in the current period compared to the same period in is the dividend payment 
in addition  in we entered into a million revolving credit facility in india  which matures in may  to finance the build out of a new india unit in a special economic zone sez which is eligible for a five year  tax holiday 
management concluded that this short term credit facility was the most efficient financing method available 
non cash investing activity of million reflects the value of common shares issued as part of contingent consideration in connection with our dcg acquisition 
we use foreign currency option contracts to partially mitigate the effects of exchange rate fluctuations on certain revenues and operating expenses denominated in foreign currencies 
please see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for a discussion of our use of such derivative financial instruments 
we accrue contingent liabilities when it is probable that future expenditures will be made and such expenditures can be reasonably estimated 
we are subject to various legal claims totaling approximately million  for which the likelihood of loss is considered more than remote  and various administrative audits  each of which have arisen in the ordinary course of our business 
we have an accrual at december  of approximately million related to certain of these items 
we intend to defend these matters vigorously  although the ultimate outcome of these items is uncertain and the potential loss  if any  may be significantly higher or lower than the amounts that we have previously accrued and may have a material effect on our operating results 
we believe that our existing cash  credit facility and other short term investments will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements  investing activities and the expected cash outlay for our previously recorded restructuring activities for at least the next months 
new accounting pronouncements in january  we adopted asu no 
fair value measurements and disclosures topic improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
this standard amends the disclosure guidance with respect to fair value measurements for both interim and annual reporting periods 
specifically  this standard requires new disclosures for significant transfers of assets or liabilities between level and level in the fair value hierarchy  separate disclosures for purchases  sales  issuance and settlements of level fair value items on a gross  rather than net basis  and more robust disclosure of the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure level and level assets and liabilities 
we have included these new disclosures  as applicable  in note in the notes to consolidated and condensed financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we account for our marketable securities as available for sale or trading securities 
available for sale securities are carried on the balance sheet at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities that are considered temporary are reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive loss section of our consolidated balance sheet 
unrealized losses on available for sale securities are reflected in earnings when the decline in fair value below cost basis is determined to be other than temporary 
credit losses on debt securities classified as available for sale are an example of other than temporary declines in value and are reflected in the other income  net section of our consolidated statements of operations 
trading securities are carried on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reflected in the other income  net section of our consolidated statements of operations 
the estimated fair value of our marketable securities portfolio was million as of december  which includes million of mutual finds and million of auction rate securities ars 
the estimated fair value of our marketable securities portfolio was million as of december  which includes million of ars and million of a money market fund the primary fund classified as marketable securities 
our investment in the primary fund is classified as available for sale securities 
in january we received the remaining primary fund balance of million 
as of december  the estimated fair value of our ars classified as available for sale was million and our ars classified as trading securities was million 
in we sold all our trading securities at amortized cost 
our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates 
fixed rate interest securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in the market value due to changes in interest rates 
should the interest rate fluctuate by  the change in value of our marketable securities would not have been material as of december  and our interest income would not have changed by a material amount for the three months ended december  exchange rate sensitivity we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates because a significant portion of our revenues  expenses  assets  and liabilities are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  primarily the british pound sterling  the euro  the indian rupee and the canadian dollar 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve 
for  approximately of our revenues and approximately of our operating expenses were denominated in foreign currencies  as compared to and  respectively  during the same period in in addition  of our assets and liabilities were subject to foreign currency exchange fluctuations at december  as compared to and for our assets and liabilities  respectively  at december  we also have assets and liabilities in certain entities that are denominated in currencies other than the entity s functional currency 
approximately of our operating expenses for were denominated in indian rupees 
because we have minimal associated revenues in indian rupees  any movement in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the indian rupee has a significant impact on our operating expenses and operating profit 
approximately of our service revenues for are denominated in the british pound sterling 
any movement in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the british pound has a significant impact on our revenues and operating income
