item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company s operating income of  for the year ended october  decreased compared to operating income of  for the year ended october  this decrease resulted primarily from i a charge of  to impair the leasehold improvements and equipment of an underperforming restaurant that the company is a majority partner in  ii an interruption of business at our sequoia property located in washington  dc due to a flood  iii increased food costs as a result of higher commodity prices  iv a slight decrease in sales at our properties that have significant amounts of outdoor seating due to poor weather conditions  and v the closure of our gonzalez y gonzalez property located in new york  ny  partially offset by operating income from variable interest entities vies that were consolidated as of october  due to the adoption of new accounting guidance see below 
effective october   the company adopted amendments to asc formerly fasb statement of accounting standards sfas no 
amendments to fasb interpretation no 
r sfas no 

this guidance requires an enterprise to perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprise s variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a vie 
this analysis identifies the primary beneficiary of a vie as the enterprise that has both of the following characteristics i the power to direct the activities of a vie that most significantly impacts the entity s economic performance  and ii the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie 
additionally  an enterprise is required to assess whether it has an implicit financial responsibility to ensure that a vie operates as designed when determining whether it has the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance 
this guidance also requires the company to focus on a more qualitative approach  rather than a quantitative approach previously required for determining the primary beneficiary of a vie  amended certain guidance for determining whether an entity is a vie  added an additional requirement to assess whether an entity is a vie on an ongoing basis  and required enhanced disclosures that provide users of financial statements with more transparent information about an enterprise s involvement in a vie 
the adoption of this guidance resulted in the consolidation of two vies which had not been previously consolidated  ark hollywood tampa investment  llc and ark connecticut investment  llc  as of october  the company did not retroactively apply this guidance 
the company has substantial fixed costs that do not decline proportionally with sales 
the first and second fiscal quarters  which include the winter months  usually reflect lower customer traffic than in the third and fourth fiscal quarters 
in addition  sales in the third and fourth fiscal quarters can be adversely affected by inclement weather due to the significant amount of outdoor seating at the company s restaurants 
the following discussion and analysis excludes the impacts of the vies consolidated as of october  and whose impacts were included in other revenue in prior periods 
accounting period our fiscal year ends on the saturday nearest september we report fiscal years under a week format 
this reporting method is used by many companies in the hospitality industry and is meant to improve year to year comparisons of operating results 
under this method  certain years will contain weeks 
the fiscal years ended october  and october  included weeks 
revenues during the company s year ended october   revenues of  excluding revenues from vies in the amount of  decreased compared to revenues of  in the year ended october  this decrease is primarily due to i the closure of gonzalez y gonzalez  in january  ii a slight decrease in sales at our properties that have significant amounts of outdoor seating due to poor weather conditions  iii the impact of management fees related to the vies which were included in other revenue in the prior period and are now consolidated  as discussed above  and iv a decrease in sales at sequoia dc as a result of the interruption of our business due to a flood  offset by sales at our restaurants robert in new york city  which opened in december  and the sporting house in las vegas  which opened in october combined with an improvement in sales at our atlantic city  nj properties 
food and beverage sales on a company wide basis  same store sales increased  or  from fiscal to fiscal same store sales in las vegas increased by  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily as a result of combining three fast food outlets located in the village eateries in the new york new york hotel casino resort in las vegas into a new restaurant  the broadway burger bar  which opened at the end of december same store sales in new york were essentially unchanged during fiscal compared to fiscal which is reflective of local economic factors 
same store sales in washington dc decreased by  or  during fiscal compared to primarily as a result of the interruption of our business at sequoia dc due to a flood 
same store sales in atlantic city increased by  or in fiscal compared to as result of new ownership at resorts casino hotel and their significant marketing efforts for the property 
same store sales in boston decreased  or during fiscal compared to same store sales in connecticut decreased  or  during fiscal as they were negatively affected by the continued unwillingness of the public to engage in gaming activities 
our restaurants generally do not achieve substantial increases in revenue from year to year  which we consider to be typical of the restaurant industry 
to achieve significant increases in revenue or to replace revenue of restaurants that lose customer favor or which close because of lease expirations or other reasons  we would have to open additional restaurant facilities or expand existing restaurants 
there can be no assurance that a restaurant will be successful after it is opened  particularly since in many instances we do not operate our new restaurants under a trade name currently used by us  thereby requiring new restaurants to establish their own identity 
other revenue the decrease in other revenue for fiscal as compared to fiscal is due to the impact of management fees included in other revenue in the prior periods related to vies which are now consolidated 
costs and expenses food and beverage costs for the year ended october  as a percentage of total revenues were excluding food and beverage costs associated with vies in the amount of  as compared to for the year ended october  this increase is the result of higher commodity prices in the current fiscal year 
payroll expenses as a percentage of total revenues were for the year ended october  excluding payroll expenses associated with vies in the amount of  as compared to for the year ended october  these increases in payroll expenses as a percentage of revenue were primarily due to higher than expected payroll at the sporting house in las vegas combined with the interruption of our business at sequoia dc due to a flood 
occupancy expenses for the year ended october  as a percentage of total revenues were excluding occupancy expenses associated with vies in the amount of  as compared to for the year ended october  this slight decrease in occupancy expenses as a percentage of revenue was due to increased sales at properties where rents are fixed offset by contingent rentals at the sporting house in las vegas 
other operating costs and expenses for the year ended october  as a percentage of total revenues were excluding other operating costs and expenses associated with vies in the amount of  as compared to for the year ended october  this decrease in other operating costs as a percentage of revenue was due to cost cutting measures implemented in fiscal general and administrative expenses which relate solely to the corporate office in new york city and therefore there is no impact from the vies as a percentage of total revenues were for the year ended october   compared to for the year ended october   and were in line with management expectations 
interest expense was  in fiscal and  in fiscal interest income was  in fiscal and  in fiscal investments are made in government securities and investment quality corporate instruments 
other income  which generally consists of purchasing service fees and other income at various restaurants  was  and  for fiscal and  respectively 
income taxes the provision for income taxes reflects federal income taxes calculated on a consolidated basis and state and local income taxes which are calculated on a separate entity basis 
most of the restaurants we own or manage are owned or managed by a separate legal entity 
for state and local income tax purposes  certain losses incurred by a subsidiary may only be used to offset that subsidiary s income  with the exception of the restaurants operating in the district of columbia 
accordingly  our overall effective tax rate has varied depending on the level of income and losses incurred at individual subsidiaries 
our overall effective tax rate in the future will be affected by factors such as the level of losses incurred at our new york city facilities which cannot be consolidated for state and local tax purposes  pre tax income earned outside of new york city and the utilization of state and local net operating loss carry forwards 
nevada has no state income tax and other states in which we operate have income tax rates substantially lower in comparison to new york 
in order to utilize more effectively tax loss carry forwards at restaurants that were unprofitable  we have merged certain profitable subsidiaries with certain loss subsidiaries 
the revenue reconciliation act of provides tax credits to us for fica taxes paid on tip income of restaurant service personnel 
the net benefit to us was  in fiscal and  in fiscal liquidity and capital resources our primary source of capital has been cash provided by operations 
we utilize cash generated from operations to fund the cost of developing and opening new restaurants  acquiring existing restaurants owned by others and remodeling existing restaurants we own 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended october  was  compared to  for the prior year 
this net change was primarily attributable to the consolidation of the vies as discussed above 
also see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended october  was  and resulted from net proceeds from the sales of investment securities and the inclusion of cash balances from vies in the amount of  partially offset by purchases of fixed assets at existing restaurants and the construction of the broadway burger bar located in the new york new york hotel casino in las vegas  nv 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended october  was  and resulted from net proceeds from the sales of investment securities partially offset by purchases of fixed assets at existing restaurants and the construction of robert in new york city 
net cash used in financing activities for the years ended october  and october  of  and  respectively  was principally used for the payment of dividends and distributions to non controlling interests 
the company had a working capital surplus of  at october  excluding a working capital deficit of the vies in the amount of  as compared to a working capital surplus of  at october  on december   april   june  and october  the company paid quarterly cash dividends in the amount of per share on the company s common stock 
the company intends to continue to pay such quarterly cash dividend for the foreseeable future  however  the payment of future dividends is at the discretion of the company s board of directors and is based on future earnings  cash flow  financial condition  capital requirements  changes in us taxation and other relevant factors in february  the company entered into an amendment to its lease for the food court space at the new york new york hotel and casino in las vegas  nevada 
pursuant to this amendment  the company agreed to  among other things  commit no less than  to remodel the food court by march in exchange for this commitment  the landlord agreed to extend the food court lease for an additional four years 
as of october   the company has spent approximately  related to this commitment in connection with the broadway burger bar construction discussed above 
on march   a subsidiary of the company entered into a lease agreement to operate a yet to be named restaurant and bar in new york city 
in connection with the agreement  the landlord has agreed to contribute up to  towards the construction of the facility  which the company expects to be  to  the initial term of the lease for this facility will expire on march  and will have one five year renewal 
the company anticipates the restaurant will open during the second quarter of fiscal on april   the company suffered a flood at its sequoia property located in washington  dc sequoia dc 
the company expects to recover substantially all of its losses from insurance proceeds and or the landlord and does not expect unrecovered amounts to have a material impact on its financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
on june   the company entered into a year exclusive agreement to manage a yet to be constructed restaurant and catering service at basketball city in new york city in exchange for a fee of   of which has been paid as of october  and is included in intangible assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
under the terms of the agreement the owner of the property will construct the facility at their expense and the company will pay the owner an annual fee based on sales  as defined in the agreement 
the company expects to begin operating this property in the second quarter of fiscal restaurant expansion in august  the company entered into an agreement to lease the former espn zone space at the new york new york hotel casino resort in las vegas and re open the space under the name the sporting house  which has been licensed from the landlord as well 
such lease is cancellable upon days written notice and provides for rent based on profits only 
this restaurant opened at the end of october and the company did not invest significant funds to re open the space 
in the quarter ended january   the company combined three fast food outlets located in the village eateries in the new york new york hotel casino resort in las vegas into a new restaurant  the broadway burger bar  which opened at the end of the december the opening of a new restaurant is invariably accompanied by substantial pre opening expenses and early operating losses associated with the training of personnel  excess kitchen costs  costs of supervision and other expenses during the pre opening period and during a post opening shake out period until operations can be considered to be functioning normally 
the amount of such pre opening expenses and early operating losses can generally be expected to depend upon the size and complexity of the facility being opened 
our restaurants generally do not achieve substantial increases in revenue from year to year  which we consider to be typical of the restaurant industry 
to achieve significant increases in revenue or to replace revenue of restaurants that lose customer favor or which close because of lease expirations or other reasons  we would have to open additional restaurant facilities or expand existing restaurants 
there can be no assurance that a restaurant will be successful after it is opened  particularly since in many instances we do not operate our new restaurants under a trade name currently used by us  thereby requiring new restaurants to establish their own identity 
we may take advantage of other opportunities we consider to be favorable  when they occur  depending upon the availability of financing and other factors 
recent restaurant dispositions and charges we were advised by the landlord that we would have to vacate the gonzalez y gonzalez property located in new york  ny  which was on a month to month lease 
the closure of this property occurred on january during the fourth fiscal quarter of  we closed our pinch s mac operation located in new york city  and re concepted the location as polpette  which featured meatballs and other italian food 
sales at polpette failed to reach the level sufficient to achieve the results we required 
as a result  we closed this restaurant on february  and it was sold on april  for  critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
while all these significant accounting policies impact our financial condition and results of operations  we view certain of these policies as critical 
policies determined to be critical are those policies that have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements and require management to use a greater degree of judgment and estimates 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
we believe that given current facts and circumstances  it is unlikely that applying any other reasonable judgments or estimate methodologies would cause a material effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows for the periods presented in this report 
below are listed certain policies that management believes are critical use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the accounting estimates that require our most difficult and subjective judgments include allowances for potential bad debts on receivables  inventories  the useful lives and recoverability of our assets  such as property and intangibles  fair values of financial instruments and share based compensation  the realizable value of our tax assets and other matters 
because of the uncertainty in such estimates  actual results may differ from these estimates 
long lived assets long lived assets  such as property  plant and equipment  and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in the evaluation of the fair value and future benefits of long lived assets  we perform an analysis of the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows of the related long lived assets 
if the carrying value of the related asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows  the carrying value is reduced to its fair value 
various factors including estimated future sales growth and estimated profit margins are included in this analysis 
management continually evaluates unfavorable cash flows  if any  related to underperforming restaurants 
periodically it is concluded that certain properties have become impaired based on their existing and anticipated future economic outlook in their respective markets 
in such instances  we may impair assets to reduce their carrying values to fair values 
estimated fair values of impaired properties are based on comparable valuations  cash flows and or management judgment 
during the year ended october   the company recorded a charge of  to impair the leasehold improvements and equipment of an underperforming restaurant that the company is a majority partner in 
therefore  the impairment amount reflected in our fiscal consolidated statement of income is offset by the share of the charge attributable to the limited partners  or  which is included in the net income loss attributable to non controlling interests line item in the accompanying consolidated statement of income 
based on the current facts and circumstances  the property does not meet the criteria for held for sale classification 
no impairment charges were recorded for the year ended october  leases we recognize rent expense on a straight line basis over the expected lease term  including option periods as described below 
within the provisions of certain leases there are escalations in payments over the base lease term  as well as renewal periods 
the effects of the escalations have been reflected in rent expense on a straight line basis over the expected lease term  which includes option periods when it is deemed to be reasonably assured that we would incur an economic penalty for not exercising the option 
percentage rent expense is generally based upon sales levels and is expensed as incurred 
certain leases include both base rent and percentage rent 
we record rent expense on these leases based upon reasonably assured sales levels 
the consolidated financial statements reflect the same lease terms for amortizing leasehold improvements as were used in calculating straight line rent expense for each restaurant 
our judgments may produce materially different amounts of amortization and rent expense than would be reported if different lease terms were used 
deferred income tax valuation allowance we provide such allowance due to uncertainty that some of the deferred tax amounts may not be realized 
certain items  such as state and local tax loss carryforwards  are dependent on future earnings or the availability of tax strategies 
future results could require an increase or decrease in the valuation allowance and a resulting adjustment to income in such period 
goodwill and trademarks goodwill is recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired 
trademarks  which were acquired in connection with the durgin park acquisition  are considered to have an indefinite life and are not being amortized 
goodwill and certain intangible assets are assessed for impairment using fair value measurement techniques 
specifically  goodwill impairment is determined using a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test is to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit we are being treated as one reporting unit with its net book value or carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
that is  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
the impairment test for other intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
determining the fair value of the reporting unit under the first step of the goodwill impairment test and determining the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including unrecognized intangible assets under the second step of the goodwill impairment test is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
similarly  estimates and assumptions are used in determining the fair value of other intangible assets 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge 
to assist in the process of determining goodwill impairment  we perform internal valuation analyses and consider other market information that is publicly available 
estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows  market comparisons and recent transactions 
these approaches use significant estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows including timing  a discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows  perpetual growth rate  determination of appropriate market comparables and the determination of whether a premium or discount should be applied to comparables 
based on the above policy  no impairment charges were necessary in fiscal and share based compensation the company measures share based compensation cost at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognizes it as expense over the applicable vesting period using the straight line method 
excess income tax benefits related to share based compensation expense that must be recognized directly in equity are considered financing rather than operating cash flow activities 
the fair value of each of the company s stock options is estimated on the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model that uses assumptions that relate to the expected volatility of the company s common stock  the expected dividend yield of our stock  the expected life of the options and the risk free interest rate 
the company did not grant any options during the fiscal years ended and the company generally issues new shares upon the exercise of employee stock options 
recent developments on december   the board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of per share on our common stock to be paid on january  to shareholders of record at the close of business on december on december   we purchased  in a private transaction   shares of our common stock at a price of per share  or a total of  upon the closing of the purchase  we paid the seller  in cash and issued an unsecured promissory note to the seller for  the note bears interest at per annum  and is payable in equal monthly installments of  commencing on december  we were advised by the landlord that we would have to vacate the america property located in washington  dc  which was on a month to month lease 
the closure of this property occurred on november our president  chief operating officer and treasurer announced he is retiring effective december  we are in the process of negotiating a proper separation agreement with him
