item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading provider of independent  technology enabled portfolio management  investment advice and retirement income services to participants in employer sponsored defined contribution retirement plans  such as k plans 
we use our proprietary advice technology platform to provide our services to millions of retirement plan participants on a cost efficient basis 
our business model is based on workplace delivery of our services 
we target three key constituencies in the retirement plan market plan participants  plan sponsors and plan providers 
revenue we generate revenue primarily from management fees on assets under management  or aum  as well as from platform fees  by providing portfolio management services  investment advice and retirement income services to plan participants of employer sponsored retirement plans 
professional management 
we derive professional management revenue from member fees paid by plan participants who are enrolled in our professional management service for the management of their account assets 
our professional management service is a discretionary investment management service  that includes a retirement plan analyzing investments  contribution rate and projected retirement income  a retirement checkup designed to help plan participants to develop a strategy for closing the gap  if any  between the participant s retirement goal and current retirement income forecast and retirement income services 
the services are generally made available to plan participants in a k plan by written agreements with the plan provider  plan sponsor and the plan participant 
the arrangement generally provides for member fees based on the value of assets we manage for plan participants and is generally payable quarterly in arrears 
prior to october   our professional management revenue was generally the product of member fee rates and the value of aum at or near the end of each quarter 
effective october   we changed our method of calculating fees for substantially all members with which we have a direct advisory relationship from quarterly to monthly  thereby calculating fees as the product of member fee rates and the value of aum at or near the end of each month for members 
as a result  the majority of our member fees across both advisory and subadvisory relationships are calculated on a monthly basis 
in general  we expect this new methodology to reduce the impact of financial market volatility on our professional management revenue  although this methodology may result in lower member fees if the financial markets are down when member fees are calculated  even if the market had performed well earlier in the month or the quarter 
due to the fee structure with one of our plan providers under which we recognize the difference between earned revenue and minimum contractual revenue in the fourth quarter  we typically see an increase in professional management revenue in the fourth quarter 

table of contents in order to encourage enrollment into our professional management service  we use a variety of promotional techniques  some of which can potentially impact the amount of revenue recognized  the timing of revenue recognition or both 
historically  we have seen a general preference from plan sponsors to schedule campaigns in the second and third quarters of the year and we expect this trend to continue 
we would generally expect our professional management revenue to continue to increase as a percent of overall revenue  which will cause our revenue to become increasingly more sensitive to market performance 
enrollment metrics we measure enrollment in our professional management service by members as a percentage of eligible plan participants and by aum as a percentage of assets under contract  or auc  in each case across all plans where the professional management service is available for enrollment  including plans where enrollment campaigns are not yet concluded or have not commenced 
aum is defined as the amount of retirement plan assets that we manage as part of our professional management service 
our aum is the value of assets under management as reported by plan providers at or near the end of each month or quarter 
our members are the plan participants who are enrolled in our professional management service as reported by plan providers at or near the end of each month or quarter 
auc is defined as the amount of assets in retirement plans under contract for which the professional management service has been made available to eligible participants 
our auc and eligible participants do not include assets or participants in plans where we have signed contracts but for which we have not yet made the professional management service available 
eligible participants are reported by plan providers as of various points in time 
the value of assets under contract is reported by plan providers as of various points in time and is not always updated or marked to market 
if markets have declined since the reporting date  or if assets have left the plan  our auc may be overstated 
if markets have risen since the reporting date  or if assets have been added to the plan  our auc may be understated 
some plan participants may not be eligible for our services due to plan sponsor limitations on employees treated as insiders for purposes of securities laws or other characteristics of the plan participant 
certain securities within a plan participant s account may be ineligible for management by us  such as employer stock subject to trading restrictions  and we do not manage or charge a fee for that portion of the account 
in both of these circumstances  assets of the relevant participants may be included in auc but cannot be converted to aum 
we believe that auc can be a useful indicator of the additional plan assets available for enrollment efforts that  if successful  would result in these assets becoming aum 
we believe that total eligible participants provides a useful approximation of the number of participants available for enrollment into the professional management service 
in addition to measuring enrollment in all plans where the professional management service is available  we measure enrollment in plans where the professional management service has been available for at least months and in plans where it has been available for at least months 
members as a percentage of aum as a eligible percentage of all plans as of december  participants auc professional management available professional management available months or more professional management available months or more 
table of contents as of december   the aggregate style exposure of the portfolios we managed was approximately as follows cash bonds domestic equity international equity total we estimate the aggregate percentage of equity exposures have ranged from a low of approximately to a high of approximately since we began managing assets on a discretionary basis in september these percentages can be affected by the asset exposures of the overall market portfolio  the demographics of our member population  the number of members who have told us that they want to assume greater or lesser investment risk  and  to a lesser extent given the amount of assets we have under management  the proportion of our members for whom we have completed the transition from their initial portfolio 
changes in aum the following table illustrates changes in our aum from over the last four quarters q q q q in billions aum  beginning of period aum from net enrollment other aum  end of period the aggregate amount of assets under management  at the time of enrollment  of new members who enrolled in our professional management service within the period less the aggregate amount of assets  at the time of cancellation  for voluntary cancellations from the professional management service within the period  less the aggregate amount of assets  as of the last available positive account balance  for involuntary cancellations occurring when the member s k plan account balance has been reduced to zero or when the cancellation of a plan sponsor contract for the professional management service has become effective within the period 
aum from net enrollment reflects a minor reporting change from prior periods related to cancellations and provider conversions 
total aum is unchanged 
other factors affecting assets under management include market movement  employer and employee contributions  plan administrative fees as well as participant loans and hardship withdrawals 
we cannot separately quantify the impact of these factors as the information we receive from the plan providers does not separately identify these transactions or the changes in balances due to market movement 
other reflects a minor reporting change from prior periods related to cancellations and provider conversions 
total aum is unchanged 
our aum increases or decreases based on several factors 
aum can increase due to market performance  by the addition of new assets as participants enroll into our professional management service both at existing sponsors as well as at new sponsors where the services have been made available  and by the addition of new assets from employee and employer contributions into their k accounts 
aum can decrease due to market performance and by the reduction of assets as a result of members terminating their membership  members rolling their assets out of the retirement plan and sponsors canceling the professional management service 
historically  member cancellation rates have typically increased during periods where there has been a significant decline in stock market performance and  in addition  member cancellation rates are typically the highest in the three months immediately following the completion of a given promotional campaign 
a substantial portion of the assets we manage is invested in equity securities  the market prices of which can vary substantially based on changes in economic conditions 
an additional portion is invested in fixed income securities  which will generally have lower volatility than the equity market 
therefore  while any changes in equity 
table of contents market performance would significantly affect the value of our aum  particularly for the aum invested in equity securities  such changes would typically result in lower volatility for our aum than the volatility of the equity market as a whole 
because a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from the value of our aum  any changes in fixed income or equity market performance would significantly affect the amount of revenue in a given period 
if any of these factors reduces our aum  the amount of member fees we would earn for managing those assets would decline  which in turn could negatively impact our revenue 
due to the current fee structure with one of our plan providers  we currently recognize the difference between annual earned professional management revenue and annual contractual minimums in the fourth quarter each year 
platform 
we derive platform revenue from recurring  subscription based platform fees for access to either our full suite of services  including professional management  online advice service and retirement evaluation  or to our online advice service only  and to a lesser extent  from setup fees 
online advice is a nondiscretionary internet based investment advisory service  which includes features such as recommendations among the investment alternatives available in the employer sponsored retirement plan  a summary of the current value of the plan account  a forecast of how much the plan account investments might be worth at retirement  whether a change is recommended to the contribution rate  risk and diversification and or unrestricted employer stock holdings  and a projection of how much the participant may spend at retirement 
plan participants may use the service as frequently as they choose to monitor progress toward their financial goals  receive forecasts and investment recommendations and access educational content at our website 
the arrangements generally provide for our fees to be paid by the plan sponsor  plan provider or the retirement plan itself  depending on the plan structure 
platform revenue is generally paid annually in advance and recognized ratably over the term of the subscription period beginning after the completion of customer setup and data connectivity 
setup fees are recognized ratably over the estimated average life of sponsor contracts  which is usually three to five years 
other revenue 
other revenue includes reimbursement for a portion of marketing and member materials from certain subadvisory relationships and reimbursement for providing personal statements to participants from a limited number of plan sponsors 
the costs associated with these reimbursed print fulfillment materials are expensed to cost of revenue 
a small portion of other revenue has been derived from a defined benefit consulting business  which was discontinued as of december  costs and expenses employee compensation and related expenses represent our largest expense 
we allocate compensation and other related expenses including stock based compensation  to our cost of revenue  research and development  sales and marketing  general and administrative as well as amortization of internal use software expense categories 
while we expect our headcount to increase over time  we believe that the economies of scale in our business model can allow us to grow our compensation and related expenses at a lower rate than revenue 
other costs and expenses include the costs of fees paid to plan providers related to the exchange of plan and plan participant data as well as implementing our transaction instructions for member accounts  marketing materials and postage  and amortization and depreciation for hardware and software purchases and support 
the following summarizes our cost of revenue and certain significant operating expenses cost of revenue 
cost of revenue includes fees paid to plan providers for connectivity to plan and plan participant data  printed materials fulfillment costs for certain subadvisory relationships for which we are reimbursed  printed member materials  and employee related costs for technical operations  implementations  operations  advisor call center operations  portfolio management and customer support 
costs in this area are related primarily to payments to third parties  employee compensation and related expenses  and purchased materials 
costs for connectivity to plan and plan participant data are expected to increase relative to our professional management revenue  as well as by contractual increases in plan provider fees as a result of achieving certain milestones 
the expenses included in cost of revenue are shared across the different revenue categories  and we are not able to meaningfully allocate such costs between separate categories of revenue 
consequently  all costs and expenses applicable to our revenue are included in the category cost of revenue in our statements of operations 
amortization of internal use software  a portion of which relates to our cost of revenue  is not included in cost of revenue but is reflected as a separate line item in our statement of operations 

table of contents research and development 
research and development expense includes costs associated with defining and specifying new features and ongoing enhancement to our advice engines and other aspects of our service offerings  financial research  quality assurance  related administration and other costs that do not qualify for capitalization 
costs in this area are related primarily to employee compensation for our investment research  product development and engineering personnel and related expenses and  to a lesser extent  related external consulting expenses 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense includes costs associated with plan provider and plan sponsor relationship management  marketing our services  plan provider and plan sponsor marketing  direct sales  printing of and postage for marketing materials for direct advisory relationships and amortization of direct response advertising 
costs in this area are related primarily to employee compensation for sales and marketing personnel and related expenses  and also include commissions  printed materials and general marketing programs 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense includes costs for finance  legal  compliance and administration 
costs in this area include employee compensation and related expenses and fees for consulting and professional services 
we have incurred and we expect that we will continue to incur additional expenses as a result of becoming a public company for  among other things  sec reporting and compliance  including compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  director fees  insurance  and other similar expenses 
amortization of internal use software 
amortization of internal use software expense includes engineering costs associated with enhancing our advisory service platform and developing internal systems for tracking member data  including aum  member cancellations and other related member statistics 
associated direct development costs are capitalized and amortized using the straight line method over the estimated lives  typically three to five years  of the underlying technology 
costs in this area include employee compensation and related expenses  and fees for external consulting services 
critical accounting policies and significant management estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  or gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  costs and expenses and related disclosures 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
in many instances  we could have reasonably used different accounting estimates  and in other instances  changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
accordingly  actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management 
to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our future financial statement presentation  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows will be affected 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap and does not require management s judgment in its application  while in other cases  management s judgment is required in selecting among available alternative accounting standards that allow different accounting treatment for similar transactions 
we believe that there are several accounting policies that are critical to understanding our business and prospects for future performance  as these policies affect the reported amounts of revenue and other significant areas that involve management s judgment and estimates 
these significant policies are revenue recognition  income taxes  stock based compensation  direct response advertising  and deferred sales commissions 

table of contents these policies and our procedures related to these policies are described in detail below 
in addition  please refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our accounting policies 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when all four of the following revenue recognition criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered or the service has been performed  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
application of the various accounting principles in gaap related to the measurement and recognition of revenue requires the company to make judgments and estimates 
occasionally  arrangements with multiple elements and nonstandard terms and conditions may require contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting  including whether the deliverables specified in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting 
other judgments include determining whether we are acting as the principal in a transaction and whether separate contracts are considered part of one arrangement 
we generate revenue through three primary sources professional management revenue  platform revenue and other revenue 
we generate professional management revenue on the value of assets we manage for plan participants  which fees are generally payable quarterly in arrears 
each plan provider sends us a weekly file with the applicable asset under management values  on a specific day of the week agreed in advance with the plan provider  but which day varies by plan provider 
prior to october   we generally used the most recently received file at each quarter end to calculate our member fees and recognize revenue for members 
effective october   we changed our method of calculating member fees for substantially all members with which we have a direct advisory relationship from quarterly to monthly  thereby calculating fees for members with which we have a direct advisory relationship as the product of member fee rates and the value of aum as per the most recently received file at each month end 
as a result  the majority of our member fees across both advisory and subadvisory relationships are calculated on a monthly basis 
pursuant to the contracts with our members  we calculate our member fees based on the asset amounts in these files as received directly from the plan providers  with no judgment or estimates on our part 
none of our member fees are based on investment performance or other incentive arrangements 
our member fees are not based on a share of the capital gains or appreciation in a member s account except as such appreciation is reflected in aggregate aum 
in some cases  our member fees may adjust downward based on overall participant or aum enrollment performance milestones over time 
our member fees are determined by the value of the assets in the member s account at the specified dates 
revenue derived from member fees for our professional management service is recognized as the services are performed 
in certain instances  fees payable by members are deferred for a specified period  and are waived if the member cancels within the specified period 
effective january   we commenced recognizing revenue during certain of these fee deferral periods based on our estimate of the expected retention and cancellation rates determined by historical experience of similar arrangements 
we currently only recognize revenue for fee deferral periods of approximately three months or less and where the member has actively enrolled in our professional management service 
if we use different assumptions for expected retention and cancellation rates  or if actual retention and cancellation rates differ materially from our estimates  future revenue recognized may vary from what we have recorded in the current period 
as a result of recognizing revenue during the fee deferral periods  our revenue during the years ended december  and were higher by approximately million and million  compared to the year ended december  platform revenue includes annual subscription based fees for access to either our online advice and retirement evaluation services and to a lesser extent  setup fees 
platform fees are paid by the plan sponsor  plan provider or the retirement plan itself  depending on the plan structure  and vary depending on the type of service provided 
subscription fees for our online advice service are generally paid annually or quarterly in advance and recognized ratably over the term of the subscription period beginning after the completion of customer 
table of contents setup and data connectivity 
setup fees are recognized ratably over the estimated average life of sponsor contracts  which is usually three to five years 
other revenue is recognized as the related services are performed  in accordance with the specific terms of the contract with the customers 
deferred revenue consists primarily of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition generated by subscription fees for our online advice service and setup fees described above 
for these services  we generally invoice our customers in annual or quarterly installments payable in advance 
accordingly  the deferred revenue balance does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi year  non cancelable subscription contracts 
setup fees are recognized ratably over the estimated average life of sponsor contracts  which is usually three to five years 
income taxes 
we are subject to income taxes in the us federal jurisdiction and various state jurisdictions 
we use the asset and liability method to account for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and net operating loss carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount whose realization is more likely than not 
we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense 
during the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
as a result  we recognize tax liabilities based on estimates of whether additional taxes and interest will be due 
these tax liabilities are recognized when  despite the belief that our tax return positions are supportable  we believe that certain positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities 
we believe that our accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law 
this assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of complex judgments about future events 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made 
prior to september   we maintained a full valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets  since the likelihood of the realization of those assets had not become more likely than not 
we continuously evaluate additional facts representing positive and negative evidence in the determination of the realizability of the deferred tax assets  including scheduling of deferred tax liabilities and projected income from operating activities 
the underlying assumptions we use in forecasting future taxable income require significant judgment and take into account our recent performance 
as of september   and december   we believed that sufficient positive evidence existed from historical operations and future income projections to conclude that it was more likely than not to fully realize our federal deferred tax assets and to partially realize our state of california deferred tax assets 
therefore  we released valuation allowances of million during the year ended december  we continue to apply a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets in the amount of million relating to the state of california as it is not more likely than not that we will be able to realize these assets prior to their expiration 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively  available to reduce future income subject to income taxes 
the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards expire through as of december   approximately million of the net operating losses will benefit additional paid in capital when realized 
as of december   we also had research credit carryforwards for federal and state of california income tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively  available to reduce future income taxes 
the federal research credit carryforwards expire through the state of california research credit carries forward indefinitely 

table of contents all tax years since inception are open and may be subject to examination in one or more jurisdictions 
we have undergone a federal tax examination for fiscal years and as a result  we received a notice of proposed adjustment  or nopa  dated august  from the internal revenue service  or irs  which reduced our gross unrecognized tax benefits associated with research credits related to prior returns 
we have determined that the nopa will not have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation for stock awards is estimated at the grant date based on the award s fair value as calculated by the black scholes option pricing model and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
the determination of the fair value of stock based awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price and related volatility over the expected term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate  estimated forfeitures and expected dividends 
year ended december  expected life in years risk free interest rate volatility dividend yield we use the simplified method in developing an estimate of expected term of stock options as we expect our employee exercise behavior to change resulting from our initial public offering 
we base the risk free interest rate on zero coupon yields implied from us treasury issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options 
we estimate expected volatility based on a combination of the historical and implied volatility of comparable companies from a representative peer group based on industry and market capitalization data 
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model 
we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
if we use different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods or if actual forfeitures differ materially from our estimated forfeitures  future stock based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating income  net income loss and net income loss per share 
direct response advertising 
effective july   we commenced capitalization of advertising costs associated with direct advisory active enrollment campaigns  which caused a significant amount of costs to be capitalized for the years ended december  and our advertising costs consist primarily of print materials associated with new member solicitations 
advertising costs that do not qualify as direct response advertising are expensed to sales and marketing at the first time the advertisement takes place 
effective july   we commenced capitalization of advertising costs associated with direct advisory active enrollment campaigns on a prospective basis as it was then determined that we had sufficient and verifiable historical patterns over a reasonable period to demonstrate probable future benefits of such campaigns 
direct response advertising costs are capitalized only if the primary purpose of the advertising is to elicit sales to customers who could be shown to have responded specifically to the advertising and the direct response advertising results in probable future benefits 
advertising costs relating to passive enrollment campaigns and other general marketing materials sent to participants do not qualify as direct response advertising and are expensed to sales and marketing in the period the advertising activities first take place 
print fulfillment costs relating to subadvisory campaigns do not qualify as direct response advertising and are expensed to cost of revenue in the period in which the expenses were incurred 
advertising costs associated with direct advisory active enrollment campaigns qualify for capitalization as direct response advertising 
the capitalized costs are amortized over the period over which the future benefits are expected to be received 
because of how we earn revenue from our professional management service  demonstrating that the direct response advertising related to our direct advisory active enrollment campaigns results in probable future benefits requires us to make several assumptions about the gross revenue we will earn and costs we will incur as a result of each campaign 

table of contents we have developed forecasting methodologies that have a degree of reliability sufficient to reasonably estimate the future gross revenue stream associated with a given campaign 
the significant estimates and judgments we use in our forecasting methodologies include average period of probable future benefits  change in aum due to market performance  aum cancellation rates  net contribution rates and estimated enrollment results for campaigns that have not yet been completed 
we have estimated our period of probable future benefits by considering both the historical retention rate of our members while not exceeding the number of years over which we can accurately forecast future net revenues 
the change in aum due to market performance is an estimate of future stock market performance and its estimated relative effect on our aum 
aum cancellation rate is defined as the rate at which assets will cancel out of professional management program due to voluntary member terminations 
a voluntary member termination is when a member contacts financial engines and terminates his or her membership in the professional management service 
involuntary cancellations such as sponsor and employee terminations or rollovers are captured in the net contribution rate 
net contribution rate is defined as the net amount assets will increase as a result of new contributions in to the k plan less the amount assets will decrease as a result of disbursements from the k plan  as a result of involuntary cancellations 
we have estimated aum cancellation and contribution rates by analyzing their respective historical rates 
we currently have assumed a probable period of future benefits of three years  no change in aum due to market performance and a zero net contribution rate 
at december   million of advertising costs associated with direct advisory active choice enrollment campaigns were reported as assets 
advertising expense was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  of which direct advisory active enrollment campaign expense was million  million and million respectively 
the table below evaluates the sensitivity of two of our most significant estimates  namely average period of probable future benefits and assumed change in our aum due to market performance  on the realizability of net capitalized direct response advertising costs as of december  this sensitivity analysis considered all campaigns that were eligible for capitalization under our current assumptions of a three year average period of probable future benefits and change in aum due to market performance per year 
the sensitivity table indicates the additional expense charges that would have been recorded as of december  if we had assumed different levels of change in aum due to market performance and or assumed an estimated period of probable benefits other than years 
direct response advertising sensitivity analysis additional expense impairments to be recognized assumed change in aum due to market performance per year in thousands average period of probable future benefits year years years years years any comparable percentage change to aum due to market performance  net contribution rate and aum cancellation rate would have the same relative impact on the sensitivity analysis as they all directly impact member aum 
deferred sales commissions 
we defer certain commission payments to our sales force 
deferred sales commissions consist of incremental costs paid to our sales force associated with the execution of non cancelable customer contracts 
the deferred sales commission amounts are recoverable through future revenue streams under the non cancelable customer contracts 
we believe this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the non cancelable customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the life of the related non cancelable customer contracts  which is 
table of contents typically three years 
amortization of deferred sales commissions is included in sales and marketing expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations

cost of revenue cost of revenue  exclusive of amortization of internal use software  increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase was due primarily to an increase of million in the fees paid to plan providers for connectivity to plan and plan participant data 
additional expense increases included headcount growth and annual compensation increases effective april   which resulted in higher wages expense of million  benefits and payroll tax expenses of million and cash incentive compensation expense of million for the year ended december   offset by a million reduction in stock based compensation expense due primarily to a severance charge incurred for the year ended december  there was also an increase in the cost of marketing print fulfillment materials related to subadvised relationships and member materials of million 
as a percentage of revenue  cost of revenue decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the decrease as a percentage of revenue was due primarily to slower increases in payroll and employee related expenses relative to the increase in revenue during the same period  due primarily to a severance charge incurred for the year ended december  we currently anticipate issuing an equity grant to certain of our existing employees in late  which will likely result in a significant increase to stock based compensation expense over the subsequent periods

as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expense increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the increase as a percentage of revenue was due primarily to increases in expenses to support operations as a public company growing at a faster rate than revenue

adjusted net income represents net income loss before stock based compensation expense  net of tax and certain other items such as the income tax benefit from the release of valuation allowances 
adjusted earnings per share is defined as adjusted net income divided by the weighted average of dilutive common share equivalents outstanding 
for all periods  the dilutive common share equivalents outstanding also include on a non weighted basis the conversion of all preferred stock to common stock  the shares associated with the stock dividend and the shares sold in the initial public offering 
this differs from the weighted average diluted shares outstanding used for purposes of calculating gaap earnings per share 
our management uses adjusted ebitda  adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share as measures of operating performance  for planning purposes including the preparation of annual budgets  to allocate resources to enhance the financial performance of our business  to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies and in communications with our board of directors concerning our financial performance 
adjusted ebitda  among other factors  were used when determining incentive compensation for employees  including management  for the year ended december  
table of contents we also present adjusted ebitda  adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share as supplemental performance measures because we believe that these measures provide our board of directors  management and investors with additional information to measure our performance 
adjusted ebitda provides comparisons from period to period by excluding potential differences caused by variations in the age and book depreciation of fixed assets affecting relative depreciation expense and amortization of internal use software  direct response advertising and commissions  and changes in interest expense and interest income that are influenced by capital structure decisions and capital market conditions 
management also believes it is useful to exclude stock based compensation expense from adjusted ebitda  adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share because non cash equity grants made at a certain price and point in time  as well as certain other items such as the income tax benefit from the release of valuation allowances  do not necessarily reflect how our business is performing at any particular time 
adjusted ebitda  adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share are not measurements of our financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss  operating income  earnings per share or any other performance measures derived in accordance with gaap  or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of our profitability or liquidity 
we understand that  although adjusted ebitda  adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share are frequently used by securities analysts  lenders and others in their evaluation of companies  adjusted ebitda  adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share have limitations as an analytical tool  and you should not consider them in isolation  or as a substitute for an analysis of our results as reported under gaap 
in particular you should consider adjusted ebitda  adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share do not reflect our cash expenditures  or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  adjusted ebitda  adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share do not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  adjusted ebitda  adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share do not reflect the non cash component of employee compensation  although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized often will have to be replaced in the future  and adjusted ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements  and other companies in our industry may calculate adjusted ebitda  adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share differently than we do  limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure 
management compensates for the inherent limitations associated with using adjusted ebitda  adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share measures through disclosure of such limitations  presentation of our financial statements in accordance with gaap and reconciliation of adjusted ebitda  adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share to the most directly comparable gaap measure  net income loss 
further  management also reviews gaap measures and evaluates individual measures that are not included in adjusted ebitda  such as our level of capital expenditures  equity issuance and interest expense  among other measures

recent accounting pronouncements in october  the financial account standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force asu 
asu addresses how to measure and allocate arrangement consideration to one or more units of accounting within a multiple deliverable arrangement 
asu modifies the requirements for determining whether a deliverable can be treated as a separate unit of accounting by removing the criteria that objective evidence of fair value exists for the undelivered elements in order to account for those undelivered elements as a single unit of accounting and also proscribes use of the residual method 
asu is effective for us prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified beginning january  early adoption is permitted 
we have determined that the adoption of asu will not have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk 
our exposure to market risk is directly related to our role as an investment manager for investor accounts for which we provide portfolio management services 
for the year ended december   of our revenue was derived from fees based on the market value of aum 
we expect this percentage to increase over time 
a substantial portion of the assets we manage is invested in equity securities  the market prices of which can vary substantially based on changes in economic conditions 
an additional portion is invested in fixed income securities  which will generally have lower volatility than the equity market 
therefore  while any changes in equity market performance would significantly affect the value of our aum  particularly for the aum invested in equity securities  such changes would typically result in lower volatility for our aum than the volatility of the equity market as a whole 
because a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from the value of our aum  any changes in fixed income or equity market performance would significantly affect the amount of revenue in a given period 
if any of these factors reduces our aum  the amount of member fees we would earn for managing those assets would decline  which in turn could negatively impact our revenue
