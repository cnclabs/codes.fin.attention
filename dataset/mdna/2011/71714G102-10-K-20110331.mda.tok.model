item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  which present our results of operations for the years ended december  and as well as our financial positions at december  and  contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this annual report on form k  including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing  includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
you should review the special note regarding forward looking statements and risk factors sections of this annual report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis 
overview we are a biodefense company engaged in the development and commercialization of medical countermeasures against biological and chemical weapons 
our current lead product candidates are sparvax  a second generation recombinant protective antigen rpa anthrax vaccine  valortim  a fully human monoclonal antibody for the prevention and treatment of anthrax infection  and rbche recombinant butyrylcholinesterase  countermeasures for nerve agent poisoning by organophosphorous compounds  including nerve gases and pesticides 
adjustments in the fourth quarter of  the company made the following adjustments as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  during the fourth quarter of  the company incurred expenses of approximately million in connection with the call and conversion of its convertible notes into shares of company common stock 
of this amount  approximately million related to the accelerated amortization of the debt discount and deferred charges with the conversion of the notes  and approximately million related to cash incentive offers 
as discussed in notes  and to our consolidated financial statements  the company recognized asset impairment charges and additional depreciation and amortization expense of approximately million and severance and one time termination benefits of approximately million as a result of its decision to shut down its canadian operations 
as discussed in note  the company recognized approximately million of charges relating to the change in the fair value of its derivative instruments as a result of an increase in the company s stock price to at december  the company recognized a reduction in research and development expenses of approximately million related to the receipt of certain therapeutic tax grants 
additionally  the company reduced its accumulated deficit by million as of december  to correct an immaterial error that understated unbilled accounts receivable at that date 
critical accounting policies estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the us requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions 
we believe the following are our critical accounting policies  ie  they affect our more significant estimates and assumptions and require the use of difficult  subjective and complex judgment in their application 
revenue recognition we generate our revenue from two different types of contractual arrangements cost plus fee contracts and cost reimbursable grants 
costs consist primarily of actual internal labor charges and external subcontractor costs incurred plus an allocation of applied fringe benefits  overhead and general and administrative expenses as defined in the contract 
revenues on cost plus fee contracts are recognized in an amount equal to the costs incurred during the period plus an estimate of the applicable fee earned 
the estimate of the applicable fee earned is determined by reference to the contract if the contract defines the fee in terms of risk based milestones and specifies the fees to be earned upon the completion of each milestone  then the fee is recognized when the related milestones are earned 
otherwise  we compute fee income earned in a given period by using a proportional performance method based on costs incurred during the period as compared to total estimated project costs and application of the resulting fraction to the total project fee specified in the contract 
we analyze each cost reimbursable grant to determine whether we should report such reimbursements as revenue or as an offset to our expenses incurred 
in and  we recorded approximately million and million  respectively  of costs reimbursed by the government as an offset to research and development expenses 
our revenue generating contracts may include multiple elements  including one or more of up front license fees  research payments  and milestone payments 
in these situations  we allocate the total contract price to the multiple elements based on their relative fair values and recognize revenue for each element according to its characteristics 
as revenue is recognized in accordance with the terms of the contracts  related amounts are recorded as unbilled accounts receivable  the primary component of other receivables including unbilled receivables in our consolidated balance sheets 
as specific contract invoices are generated and sent to our customers  invoiced amounts are transferred out of unbilled accounts receivable and into billed accounts receivable 
invoicing frequency and payment terms for cost plus fee contracts with our customers are defined within each contract  but are typically monthly invoicing with to day payment cycles 
at december   other receivables including unbilled receivables were approximately million  of which approximately million were unbilled accounts receivable 
research and development expenses research and development costs are expensed as incurred  advance payments are deferred and expensed as performance occurs 
research and development costs include salaries  facilities expense  overhead expenses  material and supplies  pre clinical expense  clinical trials and related clinical manufacturing expenses  stock based compensation expense  contract services and other outside services 
share based payments we expense all share based awards to employees  including grants of employee stock options  based on their estimated fair value at the date of grant 
costs of all share based payments are recognized over the requisite service period that an employee must provide to earn the award ie usually the vesting period and charged to the functional operating expense associated with that employee 
intangible assets because of the nature of pharmaceutical research  and particularly because of the difficulties associated with efficacy studies in humans related to the bioterrorist products with which we work and the government s related funding provisions  factors that affect the estimate of the life of an asset are often more uncertain than with respect to other non bioterrorist pharmaceutical research 
we review the carrying value of our intangible assets for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of every year  or more frequently if impairment indicators exist  in accordance with asc section  impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
evaluating for impairment requires judgment  including the estimation of future cash flows  future growth rates and profitability and the expected life over which cash flows will occur 
changes in the company s business strategy or adverse changes in market conditions could impact impairment analyses and require the recognition of an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value of the intangible asset over its estimated fair value 
if impairment is indicated  we measure the amount of such impairment by comparing the carrying value of the assets to the present value of the expected future cash flows associated with the use of the asset 
we recognized impairment of assets in canada associated with the decision to close the farm in the fourth quarter of with the completion of the protexia contract 
results of operations revenue we recognized revenue of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
our revenue consisted primarily of contract funding from the us government for the development of protexia  sparvax and valortim 
our revenue in the year ended december  changed from the comparable period of due to the following under the september contract with the dod for the advanced development of protexia  we recognized million and million of revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decline in revenue in is primarily attributable to decreased protexia revenues resulting from the completion of major development activities for this program in the third quarter of this contract expired on december   and no future revenues will be generated under this contract 
we currently anticipate the dod to award to us shortly a fixed price contract for up to approximately million to support on going research we have been conducting and funding related to the production of rbche using a mammalian cell based advanced expression system or aes 
under our contract for the development of sparvax  we recognized approximately million and million of revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the overall modest increase in revenue in the period as compared to was primarily the result of the increase in program activities under the contract during the later period 
these additional activities included the progression of our bulk drug substance technical transfer to merck rtp and the successful achievement of contract milestones  such as stability evaluation which resulted in fee payments under the contract 
the increase in revenue due to these activities was partially offset by the effect of the bid protest filed by a third party with the us government accountability office gao in march denied in june  which resulted in a suspension of activities under this program 
under the september contract for the advanced development of valortim  we recognized million and million of revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the significant decrease in revenue is reflective of the decreased activity while we conducted our investigation into the adverse events observed during the valortim ciprofloxocin phase i clinical trial 
in december  the fda took valortim off partial clinical hold and consented to our proposed dose escalation phase i human clinical trial 
that trial commenced in december  and to date we have not observed any significant adverse events related to valortim 
the term of our current government contract for development of valortim runs through september   and we expect to generate increased revenue under that contract as compared to while the company has reached out to barda to explore future funding alternatives  future government funding for valortim beyond the term of the current contract remains uncertain at this time 
research and development expenses our research and development expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these expenses primarily resulted from research and development activities related to our sparvax  valortim and protexia programs 
they include both direct expenses  which included salaries and other costs of personnel  raw materials and supplies  and an allocation of indirect expenses 
we also incurred third party costs  such as contract research  consulting and clinical development costs for individual projects 
research and development expenses for the years ended december  and were net of cost reimbursements under certain of our government grants of approximately million and million  respectively 
included in the grants was approximately million in therapeutic discovery tax grants 
research and development expenses for the years ended december  and were attributable to research programs as follows year ended in millions december  december  anthrax therapeutic and vaccines chemical nerve agent protectants recombinant dual antigen plague vaccine internal research and development total research and development expenses for the year december   research and development expenses decreased million from the prior year period 
research and development expenses decreased compared to the prior year period because of decreased activity in the company s valortim anthrax anti toxin and chemical nerve agent bioscavenger programs as well as the completion of all activities in the company s plague vaccine program and the effect of a million one time termination fee to avecia incurred in the second quarter of  partially offset by increased activity under the sparvax anthrax vaccine program 
these additional activities included the progression of our bulk drug substance technical transfer to merck rtp and the successful achievement of contract milestones 
research and development expenses were also partially offset by therapeutic discovery tax grants received in the fourth quarter of of approximately million 
the decrease in development expenses related to the chemical nerve agents protectant program resulted from reduced process development and manufacturing activities as the program completed the first phase of work under the september contract by the end of we expect to incur a lower level of costs and related revenues over the next months than we have historically incurred under the chemical nerve agent protectants program as we transition to the aes production platform for rbche 
in addition  we incurred wind down costs in the fourth quarter of related to our protexia program of approximately million  for which we do not anticipate reimbursement by the government 
we believe the unreimbursed wind down costs in will be approximately million 
in the fourth quarter of we wrote down the net book value of our protexia related assets of approximately million 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative functions include executive management  finance and administration  government affairs and regulations  corporate development  human resources  legal  and compliance 
for each function  we may incur expenses such as salaries  supplies and third party consulting and other external costs and non cash expenditures such as expense related to stock option and restricted share awards 
an allocation of indirect costs such as facilities  utilities and other administrative overhead is also included in general and administrative expenses 
expenses associated with general and administrative functions were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses decreased approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to the prior year due to cost savings measures taken in that yielded reductions in a variety of general and administrative expenses  along with the re assignment of certain employees previously classified as general and administrative into roles in research and development 
these reductions were partially offset by the recording of bad debt expense in of approximately million which was primarily associated an invoice to our government customer related to rpa anthrax vaccine development work performed at avecia prior to the transfer of development activities to a us based manufacturer and the novation of our government contract for the advanced development of our rpa anthrax vaccine candidate from nih to barda and the wind down of the third generation anthrax vaccine program 
depreciation and intangible amortization depreciation and amortization expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in these expenses in is primarily due to the write down of approximately million related to the impairment of canadian assets associated with the protexia contract that expired on december  other income and expenses other income and expenses primarily consists of income on our investments  interest expense on our debt and other financial obligations  changes in market value of our derivative financial instruments  loss on early extinguishment of debt  and foreign currency transaction gains or losses 
for the years ended december  and  we recognized interest income on our investments of approximately million and million  respectively 
the decrease in interest income is primarily attributable to the reduced average balances of our investments and cash balances as we continue to use cash to support our operations  along with lower prevailing interest rates 
we incurred interest expense of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
interest expense for both periods relates to our then outstanding convertible notes 
interest expense for the year ended december  relates to the acceleration of the amortization of the debt discount associated with the conversion of the convertible notes in the fourth quarter of  the inducement interest payments made to the noteholders in connection with our early conversion offer in november  and the ongoing interest expense associated with the amortization of the debt discount arising from the allocation of fair value to the stock purchase warrants issued in connection with the convertible notes prior to their conversion in the fourth quarter of interest expense for the year ended december  relates primarily to our then outstanding secured credit facility which was repaid in full during the third quarter of  our convertible notes which were exchanged for notes or repaid during the third quarter of  and our convertible notes 
the change in the fair value of our derivative instruments common stock purchase warrants was a loss of approximately million for the year ended december  compared to an approximate million gain for the year ended december  the fair value of these derivative instruments is estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
liquidity and capital resources overview our primary cash requirements through the end of are to fund our operations including our research and development programs and support our general and administrative activities 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including  but not limited to  the progress of our research and development programs  the progress of pre clinical and clinical testing  the time and cost involved in obtaining regulatory approval  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  changes in our existing research relationships  competing technological and marketing developments  our ability to establish collaborative arrangements and to enter into licensing agreements and contractual arrangements with others  and any future change in our business strategy 
these cash requirements could change materially as a result of shifts in our business and strategy 
since our inception  we have not generated positive cash flows from operations 
to bridge the gap between payments made to us under our government contracts and grants and our operating and capital needs  we have had to rely on a variety of financing sources  including the issuance of equity securities and convertible notes  proceeds from loans and other borrowings  and the trust funds obtained in the merger 
for the foreseeable future  we will continue to need these types of financing vehicles and potentially others to help fund our future operating and capital requirements 
we believe that based on our current operating cash requirements and expected capital expenditures  and assuming expected receipts from our government contracts  grants and other sources of funding are realized  we will not require additional funding to continue our current level of operations through at least the end of at december   accounts receivables and other receivables including unbilled receivables totaled approximately million 
the bid protest filed by a third party with the gao in march  challenging the decision by the hhs to enter into the modification to our research and development contract with barda for the development of sparvax  and resulting stop work order  caused delays in our work under that modification 
the bid protest was ultimately denied  and the related stop work order canceled in june nevertheless  the protests  along with the accumulated billing and collection delays  have reduced revenues and our available cash and cash equivalents during the first nine months of the combination of these two developments reduced our operating cash flows  which resulted in a need for additional financing to fund our working capital needs 
in april  we completed a public offering of  shares of common stock at per share and warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share  generating net proceeds of approximately million 
the warrants became exercisable on october  and expire on october  placement fees of approximately  and legal and other fees of approximately  were incurred in connection with this transaction 
these warrants are a derivative liability and as such are reflected at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets 
the fair value of this derivative liability will be re measured at the end of every reporting period and the change in fair value will be reported in the consolidated statement of operations as other income expense 
in july  we completed a public offering of  shares of common stock at per share and warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share  generating net proceeds of approximately million 
the warrants became exercisable on january  and expire on january  these warrants are a derivative liability and as such are reflected at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets 
the fair value of this derivative liability will be re measured at the end of every reporting period and the change in fair value will be reported in the consolidated statement of operations as other income expense 
placement fees of approximately  and legal and other fees of approximately  were incurred in connection with this transaction 
in november  we closed on an underwritten public offering of  shares of our common stock at a price to the public of per share  generating estimated net proceeds of approximately million after deducting placement fees of approximately million and estimated legal and other fees of approximately million 
under the terms of our previously outstanding convertible notes  unless earlier converted  redeemed or accelerated  the outstanding principal plus accrued interest was payable at maturity on july  we had the right to redeem all or a portion of these convertible notes 
under the terms of the notes  each holder converting notes was entitled to receive a number of shares corresponding to principal and accrued interest through the date of conversion plus any accrued and unpaid late charges at a conversion price of approximately per share 
in november  we offered to pay each holder exercising a conversion right an amount in cash corresponding to the interest foregone  ie  the interest the holder would have received between november and the maturity date had they held the note through maturity 
simultaneously with the closing of our november public offering  certain of our affiliates  officers and directors who owned convertible notes converted their notes into an aggregate of approximately million shares of our common stock 
these converting noteholders received cash payments of approximately million in the aggregate  corresponding to the interest foregone 
as of december   substantially all remaining holders of these notes in the aggregate principal amount plus accrued interest of approximately million  including affiliates  converted their notes  resulting in the issuance of approximately million additional shares of our common stock  while one small noteholder elected to have his notes redeemed for cash on december  of this group of remaining holders  holders of notes in the aggregate principal amount plus accrued interest of approximately million elected to accept our early conversion offer and received cash payments of approximately million in the aggregate  corresponding to the interest they would have accrued following conversion had they held the notes to maturity 
at december   none of the convertible notes remain outstanding 
the cash payments are included in interest expense on the consolidated statement of operations 
under the terms of our agreements with avecia  we are required to pay avecia million within days of entering into a multi year funded development contract that was to be issued by barda under solicitation number rfp barda or any substitution or replacement thereof for the further development of sparvax 
rfp barda was cancelled by barda in december accordingly  our obligation to pay avecia the million payment would mature only upon our receipt of a substitution or replacement thereof 
we have received funds from barda and other us government agencies under various development agreements between us and barda 
any development contract deemed to be a substitute or replacement of rfp barda could trigger our obligation to make the million payment 
the turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets and the possibility that financial institutions may consolidate or cease operations has resulted in a tightening in the credit markets  a low level of liquidity in many financial markets  and extreme volatility in fixed income  credit  currency and equity markets 
as a result  there can be no assurance that future funding will be available to us on reasonably acceptable terms  or at all 
in addition  due to the us government s substantial efforts to stabilize the economy  the us government may be forced or choose to reduce or delay spending in the biodefense field  which could decrease the likelihood of future government contract awards  the likelihood that the government will exercise its right to extend any of its existing contracts with us and or the likelihood that the government would procure products from us 
we have incurred cumulative net losses and expect to incur additional losses in conducting further research and development activities 
we do not have commercial products and  given the substantial costs relating to the development of pharmaceutical products  have relatively limited existing capital resources 
our plans with regard to these matters include continued development of our products as well as seeking additional funds to support our research and development efforts 
although we continue to pursue these plans  there is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining sufficient future financing on commercially reasonable terms or at all or that we will be able to secure additional funding through government contracts and grants 
our consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a basis which assumes that we will continue as a going concern and which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business and do not include any adjustments that might result if the carrying amount of recorded assets and liabilities are not realized 
sources and uses of cash cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term available for sale investments were million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the million increase at december  was primarily attributable to the cash received from the sale of equity during the fourth quarter of as of december  and  total accounts receivables and other receivables including unbilled receivables were million and million  respectively 
we are now current with the billing of our second generation anthrax vaccine program 
in addition  the bid protest which was denied in june with respect to the modification to our research and development contract with barda for the development of sparvax  and resulting stop work order  along with the accumulated billing and collection delays  reduced revenues and our available cash and cash equivalents during the first nine months of as noted above under liquidity and capital resources overview  in april  july  november and december  we completed various public offerings of common stock and warrants and converted our outstanding convertible notes into shares of common stock with one note being redeemed 
as part of the wind down of activities related to the expiration of our september development contract with the dod for protexia  management has reclassified certain related assets  including our production facility in canada to assets held for sale with anticipated disposal in operating activities cash used in operating activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
cash used in operations during the year ended december  reflects our net loss of million  adjusted downward for the change in market value of derivative instruments of million  non cash interest of million  bad debt expense of million  and non cash share based compensation of million  decreases in prepaid expenses and other current assets of million  decreases in accounts receivable of million  increases in depreciation and amortization of million primarily associated with the write down of canadian assets  and an increase in accounts payable of million  and adjusted upward by a decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities of million 
the combined decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities of million resulted from the use of proceeds from the financings to partially pay down these balances 
cash used in operations during the year ended december  reflects our net loss of million  adjusted for certain non cash items  including loss on extinguishment of debt of million  share based compensation of million  non cash interest expense of million  an increase in billed accounts receivable of million  an increase in unbilled accounts receivable of million and a net decrease in accrued expenses and accounts payable of million 
investing activities net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million used in investing activities for the year ended december  investing activities for the period related primarily to liquidating investments to meet working capital requirements 
investing activities for related primarily to the payment in june of million of deferred purchase consideration to avecia  and approximately million of capital expenditures 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  as compared to million provided by financing activities for the year ended december  net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was the result of the proceeds from the issuance of common stock and warrants in april  july  and november in march  we raised net proceeds of approximately million as a result of the public sale of shares of our common stock and warrants 
we raised million in the july private placement of convertible notes and related warrants  and used million of those proceeds to repay our existing convertible notes including accrued interest and all amounts outstanding under our credit facility 
we exchanged and cancelled million of our then outstanding convertible notes for our newly issued convertible notes and stock purchase warrants 
as noted above  at december   none of the convertible notes remained outstanding 
additionally  pursuant to the payment to avecia of the deferred purchase consideration and the repayment of all amounts due under our credit facility  we eliminated all of our then applicable restricted cash obligations approximately million 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations the following are contractual commitments at december  associated with leases  research and development arrangements  collaborative development obligations and long term debt contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating facility leases research and development agreements total contractual obligations this table does not include any royalty payments of future sales of products subject to license agreements the company has entered into in relation to its in licensed technology  as the timing and likelihood of such payments are not known 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is currently confined to our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure or foreign currency exchange exposure  and the movement of foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse or positive impact on our results of operations 
we have not used derivative financial instruments for speculation or trading purposes 
because of the short term maturities of our cash and cash equivalents  we do not believe that an increase in market rates would have a significant impact on the realized value of our investments
