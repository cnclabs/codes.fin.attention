furthermore  to the extent that kingsbridge sells to third parties the shares of our common stock that we sell to kingsbridge under the ceffs  our stock price may decrease due to the additional selling pressure in the market 
the perceived risk of dilution from sales of stock to or by kingsbridge may cause holders of our common stock to sell their shares  or it may encourage short sales of our common stock or other similar transactions 
this could contribute to a decline in the stock price of our common stock 
we also filed a universal shelf registration statement with the sec on form s file no 
on june  which was declared effective shortly thereafter for the proposed offering from time to time of up to million of our securities  including common stock  preferred stock  varying forms of debt and warrant securities  or any combination of the foregoing 
we have issued securities pursuant to this shelf registration statement on several prior occasions  and may do so again in the future in response to market conditions or other circumstances on terms and conditions that will be determined at such time 
as of march   we had  shares of common stock issued and outstanding 
in addition  as of december   approximately i million shares of our common stock were reserved for potential issuance upon the exercise of outstanding warrants  ii million shares of our common stock were reserved for issuance pursuant to our equity incentive plans  and iii  shares of our common stock were reserved for issuance pursuant to our k plan 
the exercise of stock options and other securities could cause our stockholders to experience substantial dilution 
moreover  holders of our stock options and warrants are likely to exercise them  if ever  at a time when we otherwise could obtain a price for the sale of our securities that is higher than the exercise price per security of the options or warrants 
such exercises  or the possibility of such exercises  may impede our efforts to obtain additional financing through the sale of additional securities or make such financing more costly 
it may also reduce the price of our common stock 
if  during the term of certain of our warrants  we declare or make any dividend or other distribution of our assets to holders of shares of our common stock  by way of return of capital or otherwise including any distribution of cash  stock or other securities  property or options by way of a dividend  spin off  reclassification  corporate rearrangement or other similar transaction  then the exercise price of such warrants may adjust downward and the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of such warrants would increase 
in addition  in february  we issued five year warrants that contain an anti dilution provision that  subject to certain exclusions  potentially adjusts the exercise price of these warrants upon the issuance of securities at prices lower than the warrant exercise price 
for the purpose of valuing securities that we may issue in the future in unit offerings  this anti dilution provision values the warrant portion of a unit offering based on a black scholes pricing model 
when such black scholes value is subtracted from the actual per unit price of the offering  per share value of the shares issued in such unit offering is decreased for the purposes of the anti dilution provision 
if we issue shares or units or warrants in a financing that triggers the anti dilution provision of our february five year warrants  the exercise price of the february five year warrants will be lowered thereby  increasing the likelihood that such warrants would be exercised 
as a result of such warrant adjustments  we may be required to issue more shares of common stock  or shares at lower prices  than previously anticipated  which could result in further dilution of our existing stockholders 
directors  executive officers  principal stockholders and affiliated entities own a significant percentage of our capital stock  and they may make decisions that you do not consider to be in your best interest 
as of march   our directors  executive officers  principal stockholders and affiliated entities beneficially owned  in the aggregate  approximately thirteen percent of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock 
for the purpose of computing this amount  an affiliated entity includes any entity that is known to us to be the beneficial owner of more than five percent of our issued and outstanding common stock 
as a result  if some or all of them acted together  they would have the ability to exert substantial influence over the election of our board of directors and the outcome of issues requiring approval by our stockholders 
this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company that may be favored by other stockholders 
this could prevent transactions in which stockholders might otherwise recover a premium for their shares over current market prices 
our technology platform is based solely on our proprietary kl surfactant technology  our novel capillary aerosolization technology  and our novel patient interface and related componentry 
our technology platform is based on the scientific rationale of using our kl surfactant technology  our capillary aerosolization technology and our novel patient interface and related componentry to treat life threatening respiratory disorders and to serve as the foundation for the development of novel respiratory therapies and products 
our business is dependent upon the successful development and approval of our drug product candidates and our drug device combination products based on these technologies 
any material problems with our technology platforms could have a material adverse effect on our business 
if we cannot protect our intellectual property  other companies could use our technology in competitive products 
even if we obtain patents to protect our products  those patents may not be sufficiently broad or they may expire and others could then compete with us 
we seek patent protection for our drug product candidates to prevent others from commercializing equivalent products in substantially less time and at substantially lower expense 
the pharmaceutical industry places considerable importance on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for new technologies  products and processes 
our success will depend in part on our ability and that of parties from whom we license technology to successfully obtain patents  defend our patents and otherwise prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights  including our trade secrets 
the patent position of companies relying upon biotechnology is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles are unresolved 
to date  the united states patent and trademark office uspto has not adopted a consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims that it will allow in biotechnology patents or the degree of protection that these types of patents afford 
as a result  there are risks that we may not secure rights to products or processes that appear to be patentable 
we and the parties licensing technologies to us  have filed various united states and foreign patent applications with respect to the products and technologies under our development  and the uspto and foreign patent offices have issued patents with respect to our products and technologies 
these patent applications include international applications filed under the patent cooperation treaty 
our pending patent applications  those we may file in the future or those we may license from third parties may not result in the uspto or foreign patent office issuing patents 
in addition  if patent rights covering our products are not sufficiently broad  they may not provide us with sufficient proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar products and technologies 
furthermore  even if the uspto or foreign patent offices were to issue patents to us or our licensors  others may challenge the patents or circumvent the patents  or the patent office or the courts may invalidate the patents 
thus  any patents we own or license from or to third parties may not provide us any protection against competitors 
the patents that we hold also have a limited life 
we have licensed a series of patents for our kl surfactant technology from johnson johnson and its wholly owned subsidiary ortho pharmaceutical corporation ortho pharmaceutical  which are important  both individually and collectively  to our strategy of commercializing our kl surfactant products 
these patents  which include important kl composition of matter claims and relevant european patents  began to expire in november  and will expire on various dates ending in or  in some cases  possibly later 
of the patents that have expired  we have filed to extend our most important patent one year  with further extensions possible into for our aerosolized kl surfactant  we hold exclusive licenses in the united states and outside the united states to pmusa s capillary aerosolization technology for use with pulmonary surfactants for all respiratory diseases 
our exclusive license in the united states also extends to other non surfactant drugs to treat a wide range of pediatric and adult respiratory indications in hospitals and other health care institutions 
the capillary aerosolization technology patents expire on various dates beginning in may and ending in  or  in some cases  possibly later 
we have filed  and when possible and appropriate  will file  other patent applications with respect to our products and processes in the united states and in foreign countries 
we may not be able to develop enhanced or additional products or processes that will be patentable under patent law and  if we do enhance or develop additional products that we believe are patentable  additional patents may not be issued to us 
see also  if we cannot meet requirements under our license agreements  we could lose the rights to our products 
intellectual property rights of third parties could limit our ability to develop and market our products 
our commercial success also depends upon our ability to operate our business without infringing the patents or violating the proprietary rights of others 
in certain cases  the uspto keeps united states patent applications confidential while the applications are pending 
as a result  we cannot determine in advance what inventions third parties may claim in their pending patent applications 
we may need to defend or enforce our patent and license rights or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others through legal proceedings  which would be costly  unpredictable and time consuming 
even in proceedings where the outcome is favorable to us  they would likely divert substantial resources  including management time  from our other activities 
moreover  any adverse determination could subject us to significant liability or require us to seek licenses that third parties might not grant to us or might only grant at rates that diminish or deplete the profitability of our products 
an adverse determination could also require us to alter our products or processes or cease altogether any product sales or related research and development activities 
if we cannot meet requirements under our license agreements  we could lose the rights to our products 
we depend on licensing agreements with third parties to maintain the intellectual property rights to our products under development 
presently  we have licensed rights from johnson johnson  ortho pharmaceutical  pmusa and pmpsa 
these agreements require us to make payments and satisfy performance obligations to maintain our rights under these licensing agreements 
all of these agreements last either throughout the life of the patents or for a number of years after the first commercial sale of the relevant product 
in addition  we are responsible for the cost of filing and prosecuting certain patent applications and maintaining certain issued patents licensed to us 
if we do not meet our obligations under our license agreements in a timely manner  we could lose the rights to our proprietary technology 
finally  we may be required to obtain licenses to patents or other proprietary rights of third parties in connection with the development and use of our products and technologies 
licenses required under any such patents or proprietary rights might not be made available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
we rely on confidentiality agreements that could be breached and may be difficult to enforce 
although we take what we believe to be reasonable steps to protect our intellectual property  including the use of agreements relating to the non disclosure of our confidential information to third parties  as well as agreements that provide for disclosure and assignment to us of all rights to the ideas  developments  discoveries and inventions of our employees and consultants while we employ them  such agreements can be difficult and costly to enforce 
we generally seek to enter into these types of agreements with consultants  advisors and research collaborators  however  to the extent that such parties apply or independently develop intellectual property in connection with any of our projects  disputes may arise concerning allocation of the related proprietary rights 
such disputes often involve significant expense and yield unpredictable results 
in addition  we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how that we seek to protect  in part  through confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants  advisors or others 
despite the protective measures we employ  we still face the risk that agreements may be breached  agreements may not provide adequate remedies for the applicable type of breach  our trade secrets or proprietary know how may otherwise become known  our competitors may independently develop similar technology  or our competitors may independently discover our proprietary information and trade secrets 
we depend upon key employees and consultants in a competitive market for skilled personnel 
if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel  it could adversely affect our ability to develop and market our products 
we are highly dependent upon the members of our executive management team and our directors  as well as our scientific advisory board members  consultants and collaborating scientists 
many of these individuals have been involved with us for many years  have played integral roles in our progress and we believe that they continue to provide value to us 
a loss of any of our key personnel may have a material adverse effect on aspects of our business and clinical development and regulatory programs 
w 
thomas amick  our chairman of the board and chief executive officer joined our company on a full time basis as chief executive officer in october as of october   we entered into an executive employment agreement with mr 
amick  which expires in october and contains an automatic one year renewal at the end of each term  unless otherwise terminated by either party 
as of december   we had employment agreements with four executive officers in addition to mr 
amick  including president and chief financial officer and treasurer  executive vice president  general counsel and secretary  chief operating officer  and senior vice president  human resources 
these agreements provide for automatic one year renewal at the end of each term  unless otherwise terminated by either party  and will expire in may in addition  in may  we entered into retention agreements with five other officers under which each officer is provided certain severance benefits  based on title 
the loss of services from any of our executives could significantly adversely affect our ability to develop and market our products and obtain necessary regulatory approvals 
further  we do not maintain key man life insurance 
we expect that  once we have secured sufficient strategic and financial resources to support our operations  including the continuing development of our kl surfactant technology  we will seek to attract candidates to join our management and development teams  although there can be no assurances that we will be successful in that endeavor 
moreover  although our five senior executive officers have agreements that include non competition covenants and provide for severance payments that are contingent upon the applicable employee s refraining from competition with us  such noncompete provisions can be difficult and costly to monitor and enforce  such that we may not be successful in retaining these individuals and  if any should resign  in enforcing our noncompetition agreements with them 
we may be unable to attract and retain necessary executive talent 
our industry generally seeks to attract and retain executive talent with compensation packages that include a significant equity component 
at this time  however  we have only limited equity incentives available 
moreover  the equity incentives  including options and restricted stock  that we have issued are  for the most part  significantly devalued or out of the money and less likely to be exercisable in the future 
we plan on seeking stockholder approval for additional authorizations to support the use of equity incentives in the future 
however  there can be no assurance that our stockholders will approve such incentives and  even if our stockholders approve new equity incentives  that we will be able to attract and retain key executive talent in the interim period 
our future success also will depend in part on the continued service of our key scientific and management personnel and our ability to identify  hire and retain additional personnel 
while we attempt to provide competitive compensation packages to attract and retain key personnel at all levels in our organization  many of our competitors have greater resources and more experience than we do  making it difficult for us to compete successfully for key personnel 
we may experience intense competition for qualified personnel and the existence of non competition agreements between prospective employees and their former employers may prevent us from hiring those individuals or subject us to lawsuits brought by their former employers 
our industry is highly competitive and we have less capital and resources than many of our competitors  which may give them an advantage in developing and marketing products similar to ours or make our products obsolete 
our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological innovation and evolving industry standards 
we compete with numerous existing companies intensely in many ways 
we intend to market our products under development for the treatment of diseases for which other technologies and treatments are rapidly developing and  consequently  we expect new companies to enter our industry and that competition in the industry will increase 
many of these companies have substantially greater research and development  manufacturing  marketing  financial  technological  personnel and managerial resources than we have 
in addition  many of these competitors  either alone or with their collaborative partners  have significantly greater experience than we do in developing products  undertaking preclinical testing and human clinical trials  obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals or products  and manufacturing and marketing products 
accordingly  our competitors may succeed in obtaining patent protection  receiving fda or foreign regulatory approval or commercializing products before us 
if we commence commercial product sales  we will compete against companies with greater marketing and manufacturing capabilities that may successfully develop and commercialize products that are more effective or less expensive than our products 
as none of our products are approved  we currently have limited or no experience in these areas 
in addition  developments by our competitors may render our drug product candidates obsolete or noncompetitive 
we also face  and will continue to face  competition from colleges  universities  governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations 
these competitors frequently aggressively seek patent protection and licensing arrangements to collect royalties for use of technology that they have developed 
some of these technologies may compete directly with the technologies that we are developing 
these institutions will also compete with us in recruiting highly qualified scientific personnel 
we expect that therapeutic developments in the areas in which we are active may occur at a rapid rate and that competition will intensify as advances in this field are made 
as a result  we need to continue to devote substantial resources and efforts to research and development activities 
our business activities expose us to liability claims and the use of our products in clinical trials exposes us to product liability claims 
if any such claims are brought against us  we may experience reduced demand for our products or damages that exceed our insurance coverage and we may incur substantial costs 
our business activities  including testing  manufacturing and  if approved  marketing our drug products and medical devices exposes us to liability risks 
using our drug product candidates or medical devices in clinical trials also may expose us to product liability claims 
if any of our products are approved for commercial sale  the risk of product liability claims will be increased 
even if approved  our products may be subject to claims resulting from unintended effects that result in injury or death 
in addition  we are subject to product liability claims involving our capillary aerosolization and other medical devices and alleged mechanical failures  design defects  or other safety issues that result in an unsafe condition leading to injury or death 
product liability claims alleging inadequate disclosure and warnings in our package inserts and medical device disclosures may also arise 
we presently carry general liability  excess liability  products liability and property insurance coverage in amounts that are customary for companies in our industry of comparable size and level of activity 
however  our insurance policies contain various deductibles  limitations and exclusions from coverage  and in any event might not fully cover any potential claims 
we may need to obtain additional product liability insurance coverage  including withy locally authorized insurers licensed in countries where we conduct our clinical trials  before initiating clinical trials 
we also expect to review and obtain additional product liability insurance coverage  if warranted  before commercializing any of our drug product candidates  however  such insurance is expensive and may not be available when we need it 
in the future  we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance  with acceptable limits and retentions  at an acceptable cost 
any product  general liability or product liability claim  even if such claim is within the limits of our insurance coverage or meritless and or unsuccessful  could adversely affect the availability or cost of insurance generally and our cash available for other purposes  such as research and development 
in addition  such claims could result in uninsured expenses related to defense or payment of substantial monetary awards to claimants  a decrease in demand for our drug product candidates  damage to our reputation  and an inability to complete clinical trial programs or to commercialize our drug product candidates  if approved 
moreover  the existence of a product liability claim could affect the market price of our common stock 
our corporate compliance program cannot ensure that we are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations affecting our activities in the jurisdictions in which we may sell our products  if approved  and a failure to comply with such regulations or prevail in litigation related to noncompliance could harm our business 
many of our activities  including the research  development  manufacture  sale and marketing of our products  are subject to extensive laws and regulation  including without limitation  health care fraud and abuse laws  such as the federal false claims act  the federal anti kickback statute  and other state and federal laws and regulations 
we have developed and implemented a corporate compliance policy and oversight program based upon what we understand to be current industry best practices  but we cannot assure you that this program will protect us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations 
if any such investigations  actions or lawsuits are instituted against us  and if we are not successful in defending or disposing of them without liability  such investigations  actions or lawsuits could result in the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions and could otherwise have a significant impact on our business 
we expect to face uncertainty over reimbursement and healthcare reform 
in both the united states and other countries  sales of our products will depend in part upon the availability of reimbursement from third party payers  which include governmental health administration authorities  managed care providers and private health insurers 
third party payers increasingly challenge the price and examine the cost effectiveness of medical products and services 
moreover  the current political environment in the united states and abroad may result in the passage of significant legislation that could  among other things  restructure the markets in which we operate and restrict pricing strategies of drug development companies 
if  for example  price restrictions were placed on the distribution of our drugs  we may be forced to curtail development of our pipeline products and this could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
even if we succeed in commercializing our drug products  uncertainties regarding health care policy  legislation and regulation  as well as private market practices  could affect our ability to sell our products in quantities or at prices that will enable us to achieve profitability 
to obtain reimbursement from a third party payer  it must determine that our drug product is a covered benefit under its health plan  which is likely to require a determination that our product is safe  effective and medically necessary  appropriate for the specific patient  cost effective  and neither experimental nor investigational 
obtaining a determination that a product is a covered benefit may be a time consuming and costly process that could require us to provide supporting scientific  clinical and cost effectiveness data about our products to each payer 
we may not be able to provide sufficient data to gain coverage 
even when a payer determines that a product is covered  the payer may impose limitations that preclude payment for some uses that are approved by the fda or other regulatory authorities 
cost containment measures  if implemented to affect the coverage or reimbursement of our products could have a material adverse effect on our ability to market our products profitably 
moreover  coverage does not imply that any product will be covered in all cases or that reimbursement will be available at a rate that would permit a health care provider to cover its costs of using our product 
provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation  as amended  our amended and restated by laws  our shareholder rights agreement and delaware law could defer a change of our management and thereby discourage or delay offers to acquire us 
provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation  as amended  our amended and restated by laws  our shareholder rights agreement and delaware law may make it more difficult for someone to acquire control of us or for our stockholders to remove existing management  and might discourage a third party from offering to acquire us  even if a change in control or in management would be beneficial to our stockholders 
for example  our restated certificate of incorporation  as amended  allows us to issue shares of preferred stock without any vote or further action by our stockholders 
our board of directors has the authority to fix and determine the relative rights and preferences of preferred stock 
our board of directors also has the authority to issue preferred stock without further stockholder approval 
as a result  our board of directors could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that would grant to holders the preferred right to our assets upon liquidation  the right to receive dividend payments before dividends are distributed to the holders of common stock and the right to the redemption of the shares  together with a premium  before the redemption of our common stock 
in addition  our board of directors  without further stockholder approval  could issue large blocks of preferred stock 
we have adopted a shareholder rights agreement  which under certain circumstances would significantly impair the ability of third parties to acquire control of us without prior approval of our board of directors thereby discouraging unsolicited takeover proposals 
the rights issued under the shareholder rights agreement would cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms not approved in advance by our board of directors 
the failure to prevail in litigation or the costs of litigation  including securities class action and patent claims  could harm our financial performance and business operations 
we are potentially susceptible to litigation 
for example  as a public company  we may be subject to claims asserting violations of securities laws 
even if such actions are found to be without merit  the potential impact of such actions  which generally seek unquantified damages and attorneys fees and expenses  is uncertain 
there can be no assurance that an adverse result in any future proceeding would not have a potentially material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we have from time to time been involved in disputes and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business  including in connection with the conduct of clinical trials 
such claims  with or without merit  if not resolved  could be time consuming and result in costly litigation 
although we believe such claims are unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations  it is impossible to predict with certainty the eventual outcome of such claims and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in any proceeding to which we may be a party 
in addition  as the uspto keeps united states patent applications confidential in certain cases while the applications are pending  we cannot ensure that our products or methods do not infringe upon the patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties 
as the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are applied for and issued  the risk increases that our patents or patent applications for our kl surfactant product candidates may give rise to a declaration of interference by the uspto  or to administrative proceedings in foreign patent offices  or that our activities lead to claims of patent infringement by other companies  institutions or individuals 
these entities or persons could bring legal proceedings against us seeking to invalidate our patents  obtain substantial damages or enjoin us from conducting research and development activities

we do not own any real property 
we also maintain at our principal executive office an analytical and development laboratory that is predominantly involved in release and stability testing of raw materials as well as commercial and clinical drug product supply 
we also perform at this location development work with respect to our aerosolized kl surfactant and novel formulations of our product candidates 
in february  we completed construction of a new medical device development laboratory within our warrington  pennsylvania executive offices that support the further development of our capillary aerosolization systems 
the facility includes a controlled environment with two class  hoods for activities requiring clean room procedures 
we also use this laboratory for component parts and finished assembly inspection and storage 
we lease approximately  square feet of space for our manufacturing operations in totowa  new jersey  at an annual rent of  this space is specifically designed for the manufacture and filling of sterile pharmaceuticals in compliance with cgmp and is our only manufacturing facility

overview discovery laboratories  inc referred to as we  us  or the company is a biotechnology company developing our novel kl proprietary technology  which produces a synthetic  peptide containing surfactant kl surfactant that is structurally similar to pulmonary surfactant  a substance produced naturally in the lung and essential for survival and normal respiratory function 
in addition  our proprietary capillary aerosol generating technology capillary aerosolization technology produces a dense aerosol with a defined particle size  to potentially deliver our aerosolized kl surfactant to the lung 
as many respiratory disorders are associated with surfactant deficiency or surfactant degradation  we believe that our proprietary technology platform makes it possible  for the first time  to develop a significant pipeline of surfactant products targeted to treat a wide range of respiratory problems 
we are developing our lead products  surfaxin lucinactant  surfaxin ls and aerosurf  to address the most significant respiratory conditions affecting neonatal populations 
our research and development efforts are currently focused on the management of respiratory distress syndrome rds in premature infants 
we believe that the rds market represents a significant opportunity from both a medical and a business perspective 
we further believe that surfaxin  surfaxin ls and aerosurf  have the potential to greatly improve the management of rds and  collectively  represent the opportunity  over time  to significantly expand the current rds worldwide annual market 
we have filed a new drug application nda for surfaxin for the prevention of rds in premature infants  and received a complete response letter from the us food and drug administration fda in the safety and efficacy of surfaxin for the prevention of rds in premature infants has previously been demonstrated in a large  multinational phase clinical program and we believe that a key remaining step to potentially gain us marketing approval is to satisfy the fda as to the final validation of an important quality control release and stability test for surfaxin  the fetal rabbit biological activity test bat 
we have been conducting a comprehensive preclinical program intended to satisfy the fda s requirements with respect to the bat 
if successful  we believe that we could file a complete response in the third quarter of  which after an anticipated six month fda review cycle  could lead to approval of surfaxin for the prevention of rds in premature infants in the first quarter of if approved  surfaxin would be the first synthetic  peptide containing surfactant for use in neonatal medicine 
we are developing surfaxin ls and aerosurf for the prevention and or treatment of rds in premature infants for both the united states and all other major markets throughout the world 
in addition to our lead products  we plan over time to develop our kl surfactant technology into a broad product pipeline that potentially will address a variety of debilitating respiratory conditions for which there currently are no or few approved therapies  in patient populations ranging from premature infants to adults 
we are conducting research and preclinical development with our kl surfactant potentially to address acute lung injury ali  and  potentially in the future  cystic fibrosis  asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd 
we have conducted and are planning additional exploratory preclinical studies to assess the feasibility of using our kl surfactant in combination with small and large molecule therapeutics to efficiently and effectively deliver therapies to the lung to treat a range of pulmonary conditions and disease 
an important priority is to secure strategic and financial resources to potentially maximize the inherent value of our kl surfactant technology 
we continue to assess an array of potential strategic alliances and financing opportunities to potentially accomplish our development and commercialization objectives 
although we are actively engaged in discussions with potential strategic and or financial partners  there can be no assurance that any strategic alliance or other financing transaction will be successfully concluded 
until such time as we secure sufficient strategic and financial resources to support the continuing development of our kl surfactant technology and support our operations  we will continue to focus on our rds programs  primarily surfaxin  and conserve our resources  predominantly by curtailing and pacing investments in our other pipeline programs 
the reader is referred to  and encouraged to read in its entirety item business of this annual report on form k  which contains a discussion of our business and business strategy  as well as information concerning our proprietary technologies and our current and planned kl pipeline programs

however  we agreed in connection with our february offering that we would not issue or sell with certain limited exceptions securities for a period of days ending in may during  we raised aggregate gross proceeds of million  including million million net and million million net from public offerings in february and june  respectively  million million net and million from offerings to pharmabio in april and october  respectively  and million from draw downs on our ceff 
on february   we completed a public offering resulting in gross proceeds of million million net 
see  liquidity and capital resources financings pursuant to common stock offerings 
our future capital requirements depend upon many factors  including the success of our efforts to secure one or more strategic alliances or other collaboration arrangements to support our product development activities and  if approved  commercialization plans 
we are currently focused on developing our lead kl surfactant products  surfaxin  surfaxin ls and aerosurf  to address the most significant respiratory conditions affecting neonatal populations 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to secure strategic partners or collaborators to support and advise our activities  that our research and development projects will be successful  that products developed will obtain necessary regulatory approval  that any approved product will be commercially viable  that any ceff will be available for future financings  or that we will be able to obtain additional capital when needed on acceptable terms  if at all 
in addition to multiple strategic alternatives  we continue to consider potential additional financings and other similar opportunities to meet our capital requirements and continue our operations 
even if we succeed in securing strategic alliances  raising additional capital and developing and subsequently commercializing product candidates  we may never achieve sufficient sales revenue to achieve or maintain profitability 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements  in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical for an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations 
for further discussion of our accounting policies  see note summary of significant accounting policies and recent accounting pronouncements in the notes to consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   in part iv to this annual report on form k 
research and development expenses research and development costs consist primarily of expenses associated with our personnel  facilities  manufacturing operations  formulation development  research  clinical  regulatory  other preclinical and clinical activities and medical affairs 
research and development costs are charged to operations as incurred 
warrant accounting we account for common stock warrants in accordance with applicable accounting guidance provided in accounting standards codification asc asc as either derivative liabilities or as equity instruments depending on the specific terms of the warrant agreement 
under asc  registered common stock warrants that require the issuance of registered shares upon exercise and do not expressly preclude an implied right to cash settlement are accounted for as derivative liabilities 
we classify these derivative warrant liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as a current liability  which is revalued at each balance sheet date subsequent to the initial issuance 
we use the black scholes pricing model to value the derivative warrant liability 
changes in the fair market value of the warrants are reflected in the consolidated statement of operations as change in the fair value of common stock warrant liability 
results of operations the net loss for the years ended december   and was million or per share and million or per share  respectively 
included in the net loss were stock based compensation expenses of million or per share  and million or per share for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in addition  the net loss includes million and million of income from the change in fair value of common stock warrant liability for the years ended december  and  respectively 
revenue we did not record any revenues in or research and development expenses our research and development expenses are charged to operations as incurred and we track such costs by category rather than by project 
as many of our research and development activities form a foundation for the development of our kl surfactant technology platform  they benefit more than a single project 
for that reason  we cannot reasonably estimate the costs or our research and development activities on a project by project basis 
we believe that tracking our expenses by category is a more accurate method of accounting for these activities 
our research and development costs consist primarily of expenses associated with a manufacturing development  b development operations  and c direct pre clinical and clinical programs 
we also track our research and development expenses by the following categories i salaries and benefits  ii contracted services  iii rents and utilities  iv depreciation  v raw materials and supplies  vi contract manufacturing  vii stock based compensation and viii other 
research and development expenses for the years ended december  and were million  and million  respectively 
these costs are charged to operations as incurred and are tracked by category  as follows dollars in thousands year ended december  research and development expenses manufacturing development development operations direct pre clinical and clinical programs total research and development expenses included in research and development expenses are charges associated with stock based employee compensation in accordance with the provisions of asc topic for years ended december   and  these charges were million and million  respectively 
for a description of the clinical programs included in research and development  see  item business surfactant replacement therapy for respiratory medicine in this annual report on form k 
manufacturing development manufacturing development includes the cost of our manufacturing operations  quality assurance and analytical chemistry capabilities to assure adequate production of clinical and potential commercial drug supply for our kl surfactant products  in conformance with current good manufacturing practices cgmp 
these costs include employee expense  facility related costs  depreciation  costs of drug substances including raw materials  supplies  quality control and assurance activities and analytical services  etc 
the million increase in manufacturing development expenses in as compared to is primarily due to costs incurred in relating to a technology transfer of our surfaxin ls lyophilized manufacturing process to a cgmp compliant  third party contract manufacturing organization cmo with expertise in lyophilized drug product formulation 
manufacturing development expenses included charges of million  and million associated with stock based employee compensation for the years ended december  and  respectively 
development operations development operations includes i medical  scientific  clinical  regulatory  data management and biostatistics activities in support of our kl surfactant development programs  ii medical affairs activities to provide scientific and medical education support in connection with our kl surfactant technology pipeline programs  iii design and development for the manufacture of our novel capillary aerosolization systems including an aerosol generating device and disposable dose delivery packets and our novel patient interface system necessary to administer our kl aerosolized surfactant for anticipated clinical development  including our planned phase clinical trials  and  if approved  commercial use and  iv pharmaceutical development activities 
these costs include personnel  expert consultants  outside services to support regulatory  data management and device development activities  key neonatal medical meetings  facilities related costs  and other costs for the management of clinical trials 
the million decrease in development operations expenses in as compared to is primarily due to our ongoing efforts to conserve financial resources and limit investment in our kl surfactant pipeline programs following receipt of the complete response letter 
development operations expenses included charges of million and million associated with stock based employee compensation for the years ended december  and  respectively 
direct pre clinical and clinical programs direct pre clinical and clinical programs include i pre clinical activities  including toxicology studies and other pre clinical studies to obtain data to support potential investigational new drug ind and nda filings for our product candidates  ii activities associated with conducting human clinical trials  including patient enrollment costs  external site costs  clinical drug supply and related external costs such as contract research consultant fees and expenses and iii activities related to addressing the items identified in the complete response letter 
direct pre clinical and clinical program expenses in and include i costs associated with activities to address the items identified in the complete response letter  ii pre clinical and preparatory activities for anticipated clinical trials for surfaxin ls and aerosurf for rds in premature infants  and iii activities associated with the phase clinical trial evaluating the use of surfaxin in children up to two years of age suffering with arf 
the million decrease in direct pre clinical and clinical program expenses in as compared to is primarily due to the completion of the phase clinical trial for arf in the first half of this decrease was partially offset by increased costs incurred in associated with activities to address the items identified in the complete response letter 
in an effort to conserve our financial resources  we plan to continue to focus on our rds programs  primarily surfaxin  and limit investment in our other programs until we have secured appropriate strategic alliances and or necessary capital 
we also plan to meet with us and european regulatory authorities to discuss the requirements for our regulatory packages  including potential trial design requirements  to prepare for our planned clinical trials 
research and development expenses by category we also track our research and development expenses in major categories as shown in the following table salaries benefits contracted services rents utilities depreciation raw materials supplies contract manufacturing stock based compensation all other total year to year changes in salaries  benefits and stock based compensation generally reflect changes in the size and mix of our employee base over time 
following receipt of the complete response letter  we reduced our workforce and restructured certain functions in research and development  primarily medical affairs 
see  results of operations general and administrative expenses 
contracted services include the cost of pre clinical studies  clinical trial activities  certain components of our manufacturing operations  quality control and analytical testing of our drug product  biological activity testing  consulting services  aerosol device design and engineering services  etc 
contracted services decreased over the two year period primarily due to our efforts to conserve our financial resources and limit our investment in our kl surfactant pipeline programs following receipt of the complete response letter 
rents and utilities are associated with our leased manufacturing  laboratory and related facilities  including our manufacturing operations in totowa  new jersey 
depreciation is primarily associated with leasehold improvements at our laboratories and headquarters in warrington  pennsylvania as well as manufacturing  and laboratory equipment  and leasehold improvements at our manufacturing operations in totowa  new jersey 
contract manufacturing represents costs related to the technology transfer of the surfaxin ls lyophilized manufacturing process to a cgmp compliant  third party cmo with expertise in lyophilized formulations 
raw materials and supplies consist of purchases of our active pharmaceutical ingredients for the manufacture of our kl surfactant product candidates and supplies to support our manufacturing and laboratory operations  including component parts for the disposable dose delivery packets and patient interface and related componentry necessary to administer aerosurf using our novel capillary aerosolization technology 
the decrease in raw materials and supplies is primarily due to a reduction in raw material purchases in associated with our efforts to conserve our financial resources following receipt of the complete response letter 
all other includes the cost of employee travel  insurances  shipping and taxes 
research and development projects a substantial portion of our cumulative losses to date  including approximately million in the two year period ended december   relate to investments in our research and development activities 
due to the significant risks and uncertainties inherent in the clinical development and regulatory approval processes  the nature  timing and costs of the efforts necessary to complete individual projects in development are not reasonably estimable 
with every phase of a development project  there are significant unknowns that may significantly impact cost projections and timelines 
as a result of the number and nature of these factors  many of which are outside our control  the success  timing of completion and ultimate cost  of development of any of our product candidates is highly uncertain and cannot be estimated with any degree of certainty 
for a discussion of certain risks and uncertainties affecting our ability to estimate projections and timelines  see  item business government regulation  and item a risk factors the regulatory approval process for our products is expensive and time consuming and the outcome is uncertain 
we may not obtain required regulatory approvals for the commercialization of our products  our research and development activities involve significant risks and uncertainties that are inherent in the clinical development and regulatory approval processes  our clinical trials may be delayed  or fail  which will harm our business  manufacturing problems potentially could cause us to delay preclinical or clinical programs  or  if our products are approved  product launch  or cause us to experience shortages of products inventories  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  as well as elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
our lead development projects are initially focused on the management of rds in premature infants and include surfaxin  surfaxin ls and aerosurf 
we believe that these neonatal programs have the potential to greatly improve the management of rds and expand the current rds market worldwide 
all of these potential products are either in regulatory review or clinical or pre clinical development and none are available for commercial sale 
while we anticipate that we will be able to file a complete response with the fda with respect to surfaxin for the prevention of rds in premature infants in the third quarter of  which could lead to potential approval of surfaxin in the first quarter of  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in securing such approval or that  if approved  we will be successful in commercializing surfaxin and realizing a profit in the foreseeable future 
we plan in to seek regulatory and scientific guidance from the fda and ema with respect to our planned clinical programs for surfaxin ls and aerosurf  however  our ability to move forward will depend upon the success of our efforts to secure strategic alliances and or appropriate capital to fund these activities 
accordingly  we are unable to project when we might implement these programs  the pace of such implementation or the overall anticipated expense that we might incur 
the status of our lead projects and our other pipeline candidates  including the potential timing and milestones for each  is discussed in item business surfactant replacement therapy for respiratory medicine 
see also  item business business strategy  and item a risk factors we may not successfully develop and market our products  and even if we do  we may not become profitable  we will require significant additional capital to continue our planned research and development activities and continue to operate as a going concern 
moreover  such additional financing could result in equity dilution 
in addition to our lead products  we plan over time to develop our kl surfactant technology into a broad product pipeline that potentially will address a variety of debilitating respiratory conditions in patient populations ranging from premature infants to adults 
after we have completed phase proof of concept studies for each potential indication  if successful  we plan to assess the potential markets for these products and determine whether to seek strategic alliances or collaboration arrangements  or utilize other financial alternatives to fund their further development 
at the present time  however  we continue to conserve our resources  predominantly by curtailing and pacing investments in these pipeline programs 
see  item business business strategy  and surfactant replacement therapy for respiratory medicine in this annual report on form k 
our ability to generate sufficient capital to support our product development activities and  if approved  commercialization plans  depends upon many factors  including the success of our efforts to secure one or more strategic alliances or other collaboration arrangements 
we believe that our ability to successfully enter into meaningful strategic alliances will likely improve with any advances that we may make in finalizing our development efforts and filing the complete response for surfaxin  and furthering our surfaxin ls and aerosurf programs leading to initiation of clinical trials 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will be able to secure strategic partners or collaborators to support and provide expert advice to guide our activities  that our research and development projects will be successful  or that we will be able to obtain additional capital to support our activities when needed on acceptable terms  if at all 
ultimately  if we do not successfully develop and gain marketing approval for our drug product candidates  in the united states or elsewhere  we will not be able to commercialize  or generate any revenues from the sale of our products and the value of our company and our financial condition and results of operations will be substantially harmed 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of the costs of executive management  business and commercial development  finance and accounting  intellectual property and legal  human resources  information technology  facility and other administrative costs 
general and administrative expenses for the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
general and administrative expenses included charges of million and million associated with stock based employee compensation for the years ended december  and  respectively 
additionally  general and administrative expenses included charges of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  associated with certain contractual cash severance obligations to our former president and chief executive officer 
excluding the charges related to our severance obligation and charges associated with stock based compensation  general and administrative expenses decreased million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in following receipt of the complete response letter  we reassessed our business strategy and curtailed investment in developing our own commercial capabilities 
we plan on continuing to assess strategic alliances and other collaborative arrangements for the development and or commercialization of our kl surfactant product candidates that potentially could provide financial support  development capabilities  and ultimately commercial expertise to advance our kl technology 
we also are assessing various financial alternatives that would provide infusions of capital and other resources needed to advance our kl respiratory pipeline programs 
there can be no assurance that any strategic alliance or other financing alternatives will be successfully concluded 
in addition  following receipt of the complete response letter  to conserve our cash resources  we reduced our workforce and implemented cost containment measures 
the workforce reduction was focused primarily in our commercial and corporate administrative groups 
we incurred a one time charge of million million in general and administrative expenses and million in research and development expenses in related to the workforce reduction 
we believe our existing general and administrative resources  including legal  finance  business development  information technologies  human resources and general management capabilities  are sufficient to support our business operations for the foreseeable future 
we may make additional investments in the future to enhance these capabilities as and when required to meet the needs of our business 
we expect to invest in maintaining our existing patent portfolio  trademarks  trade secrets and regulatory exclusivity designations  including potential orphan drug and new drug product exclusivities  and when appropriate  patent extensions  new patents  new trademarks  and new regulatory exclusivity designations  when available 
see  item business licensing  patents and other proprietary rights and regulatory designations 
change in fair value of common stock warrant liability we account for common stock warrants in accordance with applicable accounting guidance provided in asc derivatives and hedging contracts in entity s own equity asc  as either derivative liabilities or as equity instruments depending on the specific terms of the warrant agreement 
derivative warrant liabilities are valued using the black scholes pricing model at the date of initial issuance and each subsequent balance sheet date 
changes in the fair value of the warrants are reflected in the consolidated statement of operations as change in the fair value of common stock warrant liability 
the warrants that we issued in registered transactions in may and february generally provide that  in the event the related registration statement or an exemption from registration is not available for the issuance or resale of the warrant shares  the holder may exercise the warrant on a cashless basis 
however  the warrant agreements do not expressly state that there is no circumstance that requires us to effect a net cash settlement of the warrant 
therefore  notwithstanding the availability of cashless exercise  generally accepted accounting principles establish that  in the absence of express agreement of the parties to the contrary  registered warrants may be subject to net cash settlement  as it is not within the absolute control of the issuer to provide freely tradable shares in all circumstances 
the applicable accounting principles expressly do not allow for an evaluation of the likelihood that such an event would result in a cash settlement 
based on the terms of the warrant agreements and the applicable accounting guidance  we have classified the may and february warrants as derivative warrant liabilities 
the change in fair value of common stock warrant liability for the years ended december  and resulted in income of million and million  respectively  due primarily to a decrease in our common stock share price during the periods 
other income expense other income expense  net was million and million  for the years ended december  and  respectively  as follows dollars in thousands year ended december  interest income interest expense other income expense other income expense  net interest income consists of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents 
the decrease in interest income in and is due to a decline in our average cash and cash equivalents balance 
interest expense consists of interest accrued on the loan with pharmabio and under our equipment financing facilities 
in addition  interest expense includes million and million  for the years ended december  and  respectively  associated with the amortization of deferred financing costs for a warrant issued to pharmabio in october as consideration for restructuring our loan in these costs were fully amortized as of april the decrease in interest expense in as compared to is primarily due to the maturing of our loan with pharmabio in april and full repayment of the outstanding balance as of september  other income expenses for primarily consist of grant proceeds received under the patient protection and affordable care act of to reimburse costs incurred in to advance our aerosolized kl surfactant program for the prevention of neonatal rds 
liquidity and capital resources we have incurred substantial losses since inception due to investments in research and development  manufacturing and potential commercialization activities and we expect to continue to incur substantial losses over the next several years 
historically  we have funded our business operations through various sources  including public and private securities offerings  draw downs under our ceffs  capital equipment and debt facilities  and strategic alliances 
we expect to continue to fund our business operations through a combination of these sources  and  upon regulatory approval  also through sales revenue from our product candidates  beginning with surfaxin for the prevention of rds  if approved 
on november   we received written notification from nasdaq that our common stock was subject to delisting because we had not regained compliance with the listing rule a minimum bid price rule which requires that we maintain a minimum closing bid price of per share  within the day period grace period previously granted 
we requested a hearing with a nasdaq hearing panel  which stayed the delisting of our stock pending the panel s review 
on december   we implemented a for reverse stock split  after which the closing market price of our stock was above 
on january   following our hearing  the nasdaq hearing panel determined that we had regained compliance with the minimum bid price rule because our common stock had maintained a minimum closing bid price of per share over a period of consecutive trading days 
currently  our common stock continues to comply with all nasdaq listing requirements for the nasdaq capital market 
in addition  effective december   we filed an amendment to our certificate of incorporation to reduce the number of authorized shares of common stock  par value per share  from million to million 
both the reverse split and the reduction in authorized shares were approved by our stockholders at our annual meeting of stockholders on december  our future capital requirements depend upon many factors  including the success of our efforts to secure one or more strategic alliances or other collaboration arrangements  to support our product development activities and  if approved  commercialization plans 
we are also considering other alternatives  including additional financings and other similar opportunities 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will be able to secure strategic partners or collaborators to support and advise our activities  that our research and development projects will be successful  that products developed will obtain necessary regulatory approval  that any approved product will be commercially viable  that any ceff will be available for future financings  or that we will be able to obtain additional capital when needed on acceptable terms  if at all 
even if we succeed in securing strategic alliances  raising additional capital and developing and subsequently commercializing product candidates  we may never achieve sufficient sales revenue to achieve or maintain profitability 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and three committed equity financing facilities ceffs  which could allow us  at our discretion  to raise capital subject to certain conditions  including minimum stock price and volume limitations at a time and in amounts deemed suitable for us to support our business plans 
effective february   the december ceff expired 
based on the closing market price of our common stock on march   the potential availability under our two remaining ceffs is approximately million 
however  we agreed in connection with our february offering that we would not issue or sell with certain limited exceptions securities for a period of days ending in may during  we raised aggregate gross proceeds of million  including million million net and million million net from public offerings in february and june  respectively  million million net and million from offerings to pharmabio in april and october  respectively  and million from draw downs on our ceff 
see  committed equity financing facilities ceffs  and financings pursuant to common stock offerings 
on february   we completed a public offering of  shares of our common stock  five year warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock five year warrants  and fifteen month warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock short term warrants  resulting in gross proceeds of million million net 
see  financings pursuant to common stock offerings 
after taking our february financing into account  we believe that we have sufficient capital to fund our planned research and development activities to the end of the second quarter of our plans include activities to potentially advance surfaxin ls and aerosurf towards planned phase and phase clinical trials  the filing the complete response and the potential approval of surfaxin  which we anticipate could occur in the first quarter to meet our capital requirements  we continue to consider multiple strategic alternatives  including  but not limited to potential business alliances  commercial and development partnerships  additional financings and other similar opportunities  although there can be no assurance that we will take any further specific actions or enter into any transactions 
until such time as we secure the necessary capital  we plan to continue conserving our financial resources  predominantly by limiting investments in our pipeline programs 
see  item a risk factors we will require significant additional capital to continue our planned research and development activities and continue to operate as a going concern 
moreover  such additional financing could result in equity dilution  and future sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase our common stock  including pursuant to our ceffs  stock incentive plans and upon the exercise of outstanding securities exercisable for shares of our common stock  could result in substantial additional dilution of our stockholders  cause our stock price to fall and adversely affect our ability to raise capital 
cash flows as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million compared to million as of december  cash outflows before financings for the year ended december  consisted of million used for ongoing operating activities  a one time payment of million to satisfy our severance obligations to our former president and chief executive officer  and million used for debt service primarily payments of million of principal and accrued interest to pharmabio 
we received net proceeds of million from financings from stock offerings and million from financings under our ceffs during cash flows used in operating activities cash flows used in operating activities were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our cash flows used in operating activities are a result of our net operating losses adjusted for non cash expenses associated with stock based compensation  fair value adjustment of common stock warrants  depreciation and changes in our accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
see  results of operations 
cash flows from used in investing activities cash flows from used in investing activities include capital expenditures of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
capital expenditures were primarily for laboratory and manufacturing equipment to support analytical  quality  manufacturing and development activities cash flows from used in investing activities in also include cash used to purchase short term marketable securities and cash received from the sale and or maturity of short term marketable securities 
when assessing our cash position and managing our liquidity and capital resources  we do not consider cash flows between cash and marketable securities to be meaningful 
cash used to purchase marketable securities is subject to an investment policy that is approved by the board of directors and provides for the purchase of high quality marketable securities  while ensuring preservation of capital and fulfillment of liquidity needs 
as of december  and  we did not have any available for sale marketable securities 
cash flows from financing activities cash flows from financing activities were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  as summarized in the chart below in millions year ended december  financings pursuant to common stock offerings financings under ceffs debt service payments cash flows from financing activities  net the following sections provide a more detailed discussion of our cash flows from financing activities 
committed equity financing facilities ceffs since  we have entered into five committed equity financing facilities ceffs with kingsbridge capital limited kingsbridge  a private investment group  under which kingsbridge is committed to purchase  subject to certain conditions  newly issued shares of our common stock 
the ceffs allow us  at our discretion  to raise capital at the time and in amounts deemed suitable to us  to support our business plans 
we are not obligated to utilize any of the ceffs 
each ceff is available for a period of two to three years and  should we choose to raise funds under a ceff  our ability to access funds at any time is subject to certain conditions  including stock price and volume limitations 
as of december   we had three available ceffs as follows the ceff dated june  ceff  the ceff dated december  december ceff and the ceff dated may  may ceff

kingsbridge may in its sole discretion choose to purchase all or a portion of any supplemental amount that we designate 
if we designate a supplemental amount  we may also designate a separate threshold price for that supplemental amount  provided that the supplemental amount  when aggregated with all other amounts drawn under the ceff  may not exceed the total commitment amount available under the ceff
