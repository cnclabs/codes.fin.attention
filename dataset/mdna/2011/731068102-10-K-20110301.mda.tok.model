overview at the beginning of  we challenged our employees to make growth happen  and felt confident that it could rebound from the recession and deliver moderate year over year improvement in sales and earnings 
throughout the year  each polaris business and function performed extremely well and  as a result  sales and earnings growth surpassed our highest stretch goals 
while our predictions for the overall economy and the powersports industry were relatively accurate  we underestimated the market share gains and corresponding retail sales increase that were the primary sources of the year s performance 
our total north american retail sales to consumers increased percent from  helping to drive total company recorded sales to a record  million  up percent from and million above the previous record set in the dramatic success of our side by side orv business drove a significant portion of our sales growth 
however  it is also important to note how well the victory motorcycle business performed in the face of a weak heavyweight motorcycle industry  and how effectively our european team worked to overcome the difficult economic situation in many of their markets 
for the year ended december   we reported net income of million  or per diluted share  an increase of percent and percent  respectively  compared to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  our strong earnings performance contributed to a record year end cash balance  and we are pleased to be in the position to fund a wide variety of growth initiatives and capital investments in the years ahead

the company sells its products through a network of approximately  dealers in north america united states and canada and subsidiaries and distributors in approximately countries outside of north america 
growth through adjacencies is critical to our diversification efforts and will enable us to accelerate growth in new markets 
the bobcat product sourcing relationship met our sales expectations and continues to grow 
the neighborhood electric vehicle business and the military business fell short of our sales expectations  but both expanded their product offering and distribution opportunities 
during  our international team carefully balanced strong execution of our current business with key strategic investments to position us for growth in china  india and brazil 
international sales to customers outside of north america grew percent to a record million in the new monterrey  mexico manufacturing plant is on target to begin production mid and the global operations team continues to drive waste out of other areas of the business with lean and other operational excellence tools

critical accounting policies the significant accounting policies that management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition  sales promotions and incentives  share based employee compensation  dealer holdback programs  product warranties and product liability 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized at the time of shipment to the dealer  distributor or other customers 
historically  product returns  whether in the normal course of business or resulting from repurchases made under the floorplan financing program  have not been material 
however  we have agreed to repurchase products repossessed by the finance companies up to certain limits 
our financial exposure is limited to the difference between the amount paid to the finance companies and the amount received on the resale of the repossessed product 
no material losses have been incurred under these agreements 
we have not historically recorded any significant sales return allowances because it has not been required to repurchase a significant number of units 
however  an adverse change in retail sales could cause this situation to change 
sales promotions and incentives we generally provide for estimated sales promotion and incentive expenses  which are recognized as a reduction to sales  at the time of sale to the dealer or distributor 
examples of sales promotion and incentive programs include dealer and consumer rebates  volume incentives  retail financing programs and sales associate incentives 
sales promotion and incentive expenses are estimated based on current programs and historical rates for each product line 
we record these amounts as a liability in the consolidated balance sheet until they are ultimately paid 
at december  and  accrued sales promotions and incentives were million and million  respectively  resulting from an increase in the core atv and snowmobile sales promotions and incentives cost environment offset by a reduction in units in dealer inventory during actual results may differ from these estimates if market conditions dictate the need to enhance or reduce sales promotion and incentive programs or if the customer usage rate varies from historical trends 
adjustments to sales promotions and incentives accruals are made from time to time as actual usage becomes known in order to properly estimate the amounts necessary to generate consumer demand based on market conditions as of the balance sheet date 
historically  actual sales promotion and incentive expenses have been within our expectations and differences have not been material 
share based employee compensation we recognize in the financial statements the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based awards at the date of grant requires judgment 
the company utilizes the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of employee stock options 
option pricing models  including the black scholes model  also require the use of input assumptions  including expected volatility  expected life  expected dividend rate  and expected risk free rate of return 
the company utilizes historical 
table of contents volatility as it believes this is reflective of market conditions 
the expected life of the awards is based on historical exercise patterns 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates appropriate for the terms of awards 
the dividend yield assumption is based on our history of dividend payouts 
we develop an estimate of the number of share based awards which will be forfeited due to employee turnover 
changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on reported share based compensation  as the effect of adjusting the rate for all expense amortization is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed 
if the actual forfeiture rate is higher or lower than the estimated forfeiture rate  then an adjustment is made to increase or decrease the estimated forfeiture rate  which will result in a decrease or increase to the expense recognized in the financial statements 
if forfeiture adjustments are made  they would affect our gross margin and operating expenses 
we estimate the likelihood and the rate of achievement for performance sensitive share based awards  specifically long term compensation grants of long term incentive plan ltip and restricted stock 
changes in the estimated rate of achievement can have a significant effect on reported share based compensation expenses as the effect of a change in the estimated achievement level is recognized in the period that the likelihood factor changes 
if adjustments in the estimated rate of achievement are made  they would be reflected in our gross margin and operating expenses 
dealer holdback programs we provide dealer incentive programs whereby at the time of shipment we withhold an amount from the dealer until ultimate retail sale of the product 
we record these amounts as a liability on the consolidated balance sheet until they are ultimately paid 
payments are generally made to dealers twice each year  in the first quarter and the third quarter  subject to previously established criteria 
we recorded accrued liabilities of million and million for dealer holdback programs in the consolidated balance sheets as of december  and  respectively 
product warranties we provide a limited warranty for orvs for a period of six months and for a period of one year for our snowmobiles and motorcycles 
we may provide longer warranties related to certain promotional programs  as well as longer warranties in certain geographical markets as determined by local regulations and market conditions 
our standard warranties require us or our dealers to repair or replace defective products during such warranty periods at no cost to the consumers 
the warranty reserve is established at the time of sale to the dealer or distributor based on management s best estimate using historical rates and trends 
we record these amounts as a liability in the consolidated balance sheet until they are ultimately paid 
at december  and  the accrued warranty liability was million and million  respectively 
adjustments to the warranty reserve are made from time to time based on actual claims experience in order to properly estimate the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
while management believes that the warranty reserve is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate  such amounts estimated to be due and payable could differ materially from what will actually transpire in the future 
product liability we are subject to product liability claims in the normal course of business 
we self insure our product liability claims 
the estimated costs resulting from any losses are charged to operating expenses when it is probable a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably determinable 
we utilize historical trends and actuarial analysis tools to assist in determining the appropriate loss reserve levels 
at december  and  we had accruals of million and million  respectively  for the possible payment of pending claims related to continuing operations 
these accruals are included in other accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheets 
in addition  we had an accrual of million and million at december  and  respectively  for the possible payment of pending claims related to discontinued operations 
while management believes the product liability reserves are adequate  adverse determination of material product liability claims made against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition

we are subject to market risk from fluctuating market prices of certain purchased commodities and raw materials  including steel  aluminum  fuel  natural gas and petroleum based resins 
in addition  we are a purchaser of components and parts containing various commodities  including steel  aluminum  rubber and others which are integrated into our end products 
while such materials are typically available from numerous suppliers  commodity raw materials are subject to price fluctuations 
we generally buy these commodities and components based upon market prices that are established with the vendor as part of the purchase process 
we generally attempt to obtain firm pricing from most of our suppliers for volumes consistent with planned production 
to the extent that commodity prices increase and we do not have firm pricing from our suppliers  or our suppliers are not able to honor such prices  we may experience gross margin declines to the extent we are not able to increase selling prices of our products
