overview of transformational year stillwater mining company the company is a delaware corporation  headquartered in billings  montana and listed on the new york stock exchange under the symbol swc 
the company mines  processes  refines and markets palladium and platinum ores from two underground mines situated within the j m reef  an extensive trend of pgm mineralization located in stillwater and sweet grass counties in south central montana 
ore produced from each of the mines is crushed and concentrated in mills located at each mine site 
the resulting concentrates are then trucked to the company s smelting and refining complex in columbus  montana which processes the mine concentrates along with recycled spent catalyst materials received from third parties 
a portion of the recycling material is purchased for the company s own account and the balance is toll processed for a fee on behalf of others 
the finished product of the company s base metal refinery is a pgm rich filter cake which is shipped to third parties for final refining into finished metal 
the company regards as a transformational year for several reasons increased metal prices 
commodity markets in general received worldwide attention throughout in the case of palladium  the price increased from per ounce at the beginning of to per ounce at year end  a increase 
among the factors contributing to this increase were the robust economy in china  the gradual return of the automotive sector after its steep decline in and  growing acceptance worldwide of palladium as a jewelry metal  the introduction of palladium and platinum exchange traded funds into the us market in early  and speculation that the russian government has nearly depleted its soviet era stockpile of palladium  all of which accounted for strong demand and a limited worldwide supply of the metal 
diversification 
in november  the company acquired the pgm assets of marathon pgm corporation  a canadian exploration company 
the transaction was valued at us million which included million of deferred income tax liability assumed utilizing a combination of cash and newly issued shares of the company s common stock 
the principal property acquired is a large pgm and copper deposit located near the town of marathon  ontario  canada 
while the marathon deposit is currently in the permitting stage and will not be in production for several years  the acquisition represents a significant decision to diversify beyond the company s operations in the j m reef 
the marathon acquisition follows several years of evaluating possible acquisitions in an effort to reduce the company s exposure to a single mining property 
the company expects to devote significant cost and attention to the development of the marathon property and will continue to review other diversification opportunities in the future 
sale by majority owner 
in december  mmc norilsk nickel  the company s majority shareholder  announced that it had completed an underwritten secondary offering of all its holdings of stillwater common stock  thereby eliminating its entire voting interest in the company 
norilsk nickel s two non independent nominees on the board of directors subsequently resigned and the shareholders agreement between the company and norilsk nickel terminated 
norilsk nickel s investment in the company provided valuable liquidity and signaled a commitment to the palladium market when they entered into it in june of with norilsk nickel s exit at the end of  the company believes that it is now well positioned to move forward as an independent entity 
the sale by norilsk nickel had the effect of virtually doubling the public float of the company s common stock  without diluting any existing shareholders 
strong recycling business 
revenues from the company s pgm recycling business more than doubled in and the company expects to continue to grow and expand this business 
the recycling business is highly complementary to the company s basic mining business and has shown that it can be nicely profitable 
the company in recent years has updated its recycling business model  strengthening its controls over this business and reducing its exposure to credit and pricing risk 

table of contents principal factors affecting stillwater mining company the surface expression of the j m reef which the company controls is about miles long and was originally part of a much larger reef structure located several miles deep in the earth 
when the beartooth mountains were formed as part of the rocky mountain uplift about million years ago  this portion of the reef was broken off from the larger structure as it was uplifted in the mountain 
the resource the company is now mining is about a mile in vertical extent  generally about five feet thick  and is typically found tilted up at an angle of about although this angle varies considerably depending on location 
pgm ore grades in the j m reef are some of the highest in the world with comparatively low mining cost per ounce  but they are palladium rich and  because of the uplifted configuration of the reef  complex to mine 
the mines compete primarily with the platinum rich pgm ore reserves within south africa s bushveld complex  which are less steeply dipping but today tend to be deep underground which generally results in comparatively higher mining costs per ounce  and with the nickel mines in the russian federation which produce palladium rich pgms as a major by product and so at a very low marginal cost 
consequently  the company s financial performance relative to its peers depends not only on the level of pgm prices  but also on the differential between the price of platinum and the price of palladium 
in periods of low pgm prices  and in particular when palladium prices also are low relative to platinum prices  the company s palladium rich production may put it at a disadvantage to comparable mines in south africa 
see business  risk factors and properties risk factors the company may be competitively disadvantaged as a primary pgm producer with a preponderance of palladium for further discussion 
the first of the company s two montana mining operations  the stillwater mine  is situated near the town of nye toward the eastern end of the j m reef 
the mine s primary portals are located at  feet above sea level  with access through horizontal adits on both sides of the stillwater valley and via a shaft and hoist from the  foot level down to about the  foot elevation 
stillwater mine first opened in and currently has developed portions of the reef along about six horizontal miles underground on various levels ranging from about  feet at the deepest up to  feet above sea level 
typically  the lower portion of the stillwater mine accessed from the shaft appropriately known as the off shaft area has contained relatively high ore grades  but the ore in this area is found in pods and tends to be inconsistent with respect to continuity  grade and thickness along the reef 
by contrast  the western portion of the mine above the  level the upper west area generally has somewhat lower ore grades but the ore in this area is relatively consistent as to continuity  grade and thickness along the reef 
overall ounce production at the stillwater mine  then  is sensitive not only to the ore tons produced from each of these areas  but also  in view of the grade difference  to the relative proportion of total ore produced from each area 
in  the mine produced  ounces of palladium and platinum off from  ounces in and generated sales revenues of million 
at december   the mine had employees  including miners 
the company s other montana mine  the east boulder mine  is located southeast of big timber and mcleod in the gallatin national forest  on the western portion of the j m reef 
it is accessed by two parallel  foot horizontal rail adits that intersect the reef perpendicularly at the  foot elevation deep within the mountain 
the mine first opened in  and has developed along about horizontal miles of the j m reef underground  with operations on different levels ranging from about  to  feet above sea level 
during  east boulder mine produced  ounces of palladium and platinum compared to  ounces in with sales revenue of million 
at the end of  the mine had employees  including miners 
the company recycles spent catalyst materials through its processing facilities in columbus  montana  recovering palladium  platinum and rhodium from these materials 
the recycling segment has proven to be a profitable ancillary business 
however  the recycling business has also proven to be very sensitive to pgm prices  and volumes of recycling material available in the market have dropped very sharply when pgm prices have declined  as has the profitability of the business 
the company believes it enjoys certain competitive advantages in the recycling business 
the smelting and refining complex in columbus montana already processes mined pgm concentrates  which contain not only pgms  but also significant quantities of nickel and copper as by products 
copper and nickel bind with the pgms from recycling in the smelter and so aid in collecting the pgms 
consequently  the company is able to recycle catalyst material within its system at an incremental cost lower than other processors 
moreover  the company also believes the physical location of its processing facilities provides a logistical advantage over smelters in europe and south africa 
and as described below  the company is incorporating certain technological innovations that may contribute further benefit 

table of contents since the company s recycling activities are substantially dependent on the availability in the smelter of the copper and nickel contained in the mine concentrates  should it become necessary at some point to reduce or suspend operations at the mines  the proportion of operating costs allocated to the recycling segment could increase  making the recycling segment less competitive 
further  in order to operate the smelter and refinery without significant volumes of mine concentrates  modifications to the processing facilities would probably be required 
there is no assurance that the recycling facilities can operate profitably in the absence of significant concentrates from the mines  or that capital would be available under those circumstances to complete any necessary modifications to the processing facilities 
the company has taken steps over the past year or so to reposition itself in the recycling business 
in may  the company commissioned a new electric furnace in the columbus smelter  increasing throughput capacity and creating backup furnace capacity in the event of planned or unforeseen outages 
during the third quarter  the company commissioned a dedicated catalyst processing and sampling plant that allows for the segregation and handling of multiple batches of recycling material simultaneously 
in early  the company will commission a state of the art assay laboratory constructed and equipped in which utilizes an automated x ray facility that will provide accurate results with faster turnaround times than conventional fire assay methods 
new laboratory software will support this automated x ray system  as well as  other laboratory processes 
in acquiring recycled automotive catalysts  the company advances funds to its suppliers ahead of actually receiving material in order to facilitate procurement efforts 
in past years these working capital advances often were very substantial and represented significant financial exposure for the company 
however  following the steep drop in pgm prices during the second half of  which resulted in large inventory losses for many of the company s suppliers and led to the company writing off million of such advances as uncollectible  the company revisited its recycling business model 
in general  the company now only advances funds to suppliers when the associated material for recycling is awaiting transit or is already in transit to the columbus processing facilities 
the new recycling sampling and assay facilities will allow the company to accelerate final settlements with suppliers  thereby reducing the amount of working capital they require and partially offsetting the competitive disadvantage of curtailing advances 
outstanding procurement advances that were not backed up by inventory physically in the company s possession at december  and  totaled million and million  respectively 
performance graph following the collapse in most metal prices during the second half of  platinum and palladium market prices generally trended up during most of and  with both metals closing on or near their highs in london of  and per ounce  respectively  at the end of in new york  the palladium price closed at per ounce 
pgm prices have been closely correlated with the ratio of the us dollar to the euro in recent years  and they declined somewhat during may and june of in response to european economic uncertainty and associated strengthening of the us dollar 
prices then recovered as the european monetary crisis subsided and the dollar weakened in anticipation of further quantitative easing 

table of contents an additional factor supporting pgm prices in was the introduction of pgm exchange traded funds etfs into the us in january of the etfs have proven to be a popular investment vehicle  and it was estimated that by the end of  etfs worldwide held about two million ounces of palladium and a million ounces of platinum 
the company expects that if the world economic recovery continues on track  there will likely be continued strong demand from asia for raw materials  including pgms  and specifically accelerated growth in automotive demand around the world 
on the supply side  it appears there has been a significant reduction in palladium exports from the russian government s stockpiles over the past year and a half  and various commentators inside and outside of russia have suggested recently that those stockpiles are approaching exhaustion 
the diminution of those exports  coupled with very limited ability to ramp up production at existing pgm operations  suggests that markets for these metals may continue to be fairly tight for the foreseeable future 
however  this market view also encompasses certain risks 
pgm trading volumes are relatively thin and their markets have limited liquidity  particularly in comparison to markets for other precious metals and the major industrial metals 
consequently  pgm prices historically have been volatile and difficult to forecast 
pgm prices may be affected favorably or unfavorably by numerous factors  including the level of industrial demand  particularly from the automotive sector  supply factors that include changes in mine production and inventory activity  and by shifts in investor sentiment 
in particular  although exports from the russian government inventories appear to have slowed  the russian federation does not officially disclose its inventory holdings and there is no assurance that those inventories are actually approaching depletion 
recent pgm prices are comparatively high by historical standards  and to some extent these price levels are likely driven by investor sentiment that could shift away from precious metals if other markets become more attractive 
the company attempts to manage this market volatility in several ways  including by entering into long term supply agreements  in some cases through metal hedging  by investing in the developed state of the mines  giving attention to cost controls and by monitoring the company s liquidity closely to provide capacity to bridge periods when pgm prices are low 
automotive demand generally continued to strengthen worldwide during after its steep decline during late and light vehicle sales in north america are estimated at million units during  up from million units in chinese light vehicle sales in are estimated at million units  up from about million units in worldwide mine production of palladium and platinum  which had declined in every year since peaking in  appears to have strengthened slightly during north american palladium s lac des iles mine in canada  which was shut down due to the economic recession and weak metal prices for about months  reopened during the second quarter and is currently reported to be producing palladium and platinum at an annual rate of between  and  ounces 
norilsk nickel  which produces about of the world s annual palladium output as a by product of its nickel operations  had indicated that its production was likely to be equal to or slightly ahead of its production 
and the south african producers collectively  while projecting slight production increases each year  consistently have encountered operational or other issues that have limited their output growth 
overall  the company s assessment is that pgm supplies remain constrained  with little opportunity for significant growth in worldwide output over the next few years 
this is true despite the current strong market prices for pgms that normally would incentivize production growth 
of some concern in the pgm industry is the lack of an adequate level of reinvestment in the business in recent years 
while a few smaller companies  principally in south africa  have invested in developing new mines  the amount of new production they are generating is not sufficient over the longer term to sustain current production levels 
putting in a large new underground mine on the bushveld in south africa requires an investment of a billion dollars or so in a new shaft and takes four or five years to develop 
although current pgm prices seem comparatively robust in us dollars  an adverse exchange rate for the south african rand has limited the benefit of higher metal prices to south african producers 
as a result  they do not see price levels that can justify the kinds of new mining investments that need to be made 
when coupled with other challenges in south africa  including power shortages  rapidly escalating wage structures  political uncertainty on several fronts  and declining availability of experienced professionals  the outlook for adequate future reinvestment there seems fairly bleak 
in response to the steep deterioration in pgm prices during the second half of  the company restructured its operations  focusing its business plans for and on conserving cash and maintaining the company s financial viability 
as a result  the company transferred miners and laid off about of its total employee workforce  terminated most contractors  adjusted the company s mining processes  relocated the company s corporate offices  and severely restricted operating and capital expenditures 
in total  the company reduced its employee workforce by between september and march and by another positions during the remainder of by march of  the miner 
table of contents workforce at the east boulder mine had been reduced to from  while transfers to the stillwater mine had increased the number of miners there to from at the same time  the company eliminated contractor positions  mostly at the stillwater mine 
the company also sharply reduced support staffing at all locations 
several corporate programs  including market development  recruiting  exploration and investor relations  were eliminated or sharply curtailed in and remained restricted during capital spending  which had totaled about million in  was reduced to million in and million in in an effort to conserve cash 
as the fundamentals of the pgm markets strengthened during  the company assembled a special planning team to review and prioritize additional pgm development opportunities within the company s holdings along the j m reef 
these opportunities were grouped into nine different potential projects  each of which was evaluated based on several criteria  including grade potential  likely capital and operating costs  time and complexity to implement  and ease of access 
two of these opportunities emerged as clear favorites the blitz and graham creek projects 
both projects are expected to begin in the blitz project envisions developing two  foot parallel drifts in the footwall on the  and  levels eastward from the existing infrastructure in the stillwater mine and ultimately driving a ventilation shaft to surface from the end of these drifts 
definition drilling from these drifts could provide a wealth of information about the j m reef and perhaps identify attractive future areas for mining 
depending on the project outcome  blitz production could either serve to extend the ultimate life of the stillwater mine or to increase the production rate from the mine 
the blitz development is projected to take about five years to complete at a total cost of about million 
the graham creek project is similar  but would develop westward in the footwall from the existing infrastructure at the east boulder mine  utilizing an existing tunnel boring machine to extend out about  feet from the current western extremity of the mine 
again  the plan would include adding a new ventilation raise to surface at the end of the drift 
this project also is projected to take about five years to complete  but its total cost is estimated at only about million 
the lower cost relative to the blitz project is attributable to the shorter length of the drift  initially developing only a single drift compared to two in the blitz development  and the lower cost of developing with an in place tunnel boring machine 
the benefits of the graham creek project are analogous to those at the blitz  including potential to extend mine life or possibly to increase production rates  and the opportunity to expand the company s knowledge of an undeveloped section of the j m reef 
the recovery of the pgm markets during and also allowed the company to proceed with an attractive canadian acquisition  the pgm assets of marathon pgm corporation in late the principal asset acquired is a pgm development project near the town of marathon  ontario on the north shore of lake superior 
the project will require several years to complete permitting and mine construction  but the company believes it could be in production by or the project feasibility study indicates potential annual production from the completed mine of about  ounces of pgms and million pounds of copper 
at recent metal prices  the marathon development could contribute substantially to the company s future financial performance 
in light of the environmental protection agency s recent determination to regulate carbon dioxide co emissions as hazardous to health  the company has assessed its exposure to likely restrictions on such emissions 
the company s principal sources of co emissions are limited to a comparatively few internal combustion engines in vehicles and mining equipment  and to stationary sources such as process heaters  dryers and converters that consume natural gas 
the company already utilizes buses to transport its workforce to and from the mines and utilizes a blend of biodiesel fuels in its operations which reduces workplace diesel particulate matter emissions and its carbon footprint 
consequently  any taxes or added restrictions on emissions are unlikely to have any direct material effect on the company s operations 
the company s physical exposure to climate change is minimal 
the company s operations are not materially dependent upon weather patterns or seasonal availability of water 
the relatively remote location of the mines presents some exposure to severe weather  particularly winter snowfall that can restrict access to the mine sites  but the company already regularly addresses this issue during the winter months in montana 
similarly  summer wildfires can temporarily restrict access to the mines  but their duration tends to be relatively short 
probably the company s most significant exposure to greenhouse gas regulation is the potential consequence of a substantial longer term movement away from internal combustion engines on the demand for pgms in catalytic converters 
such a major shift in automotive demand could depress pgm prices and impair the company s financial performance 
regulatory constraints on other industries also could affect the price or availability of electricity and other materials  driving up the company s operating costs 

table of contents results and commentary for the full year  the company reported net income of million  or per fully diluted share  a substantial improvement over the loss of million  or per diluted share  reported for and the loss of million  or per diluted share in the results included a property  plant and equipment impairment charge of million and a loss on advances on inventory purchases of million 
steadily strengthening realized prices over the course of for the company s primary products  palladium and platinum  more than offset the effect of lower ounce production relative to the company s average realized price on sales of mined palladium and platinum was per ounce in  substantially higher than the per ounce average realized in had these same sales taken place at market prices  the company s average would have been per ounce and the average per ounce 
the company s combined average realized price for each metal differed from equivalent average market prices as the result of various contractual provisions  which included ceiling prices that applied to a portion of the company s mined platinum  floor prices that during most of benefited the company s mined palladium  small contractual discounts on those volumes not subject to floors or ceilings  and selling prices based on monthly averages which generally have lagged the market price by one month 
the company s mine production of palladium and platinum totaled  ounces in  down compared to  ounces in the lower mine production in was primarily attributable to operational and grade issues in the off shaft area of the stillwater mine 
revenues from mining in totaled million  up from million in  on stronger realized prices in for the company s primary products  palladium and platinum 
stillwater mine s total cash costs averaged per ounce for the full year  higher than originally planned and above the per ounce actually realized in interestingly  looking at tons mined instead of ounces produced  the average cash cost per ore ton mined in at stillwater mine was  less than the per ton reported in this result suggests that the higher cost per ounce in was mostly driven by the lower ore grade at stillwater  rather than by rising costs or lower mining productivity 
a higher than usual proportion of mining stopes in the off shaft area of the mine are currently either early or late in their production life and are somewhat smaller than has been typical in the past both factors that might tend to result in more volatility in realized ore grades 
also  a higher proportion of stillwater mine production came out of the upper west area of the mine in than was originally planned  and ore grades in the upper west tend to be lower than in the off shaft area 
capital expenditures at the stillwater mine totaled million in  exceeding plan and well ahead of the million spent during primary development at the stillwater mine advanced about  feet during  about ahead of plan  but to some extent this was at the expense of secondary development  which at about  feet was behind plan 
diamond drilling footages in at the stillwater mine totaled about  feet  about better than planned 
total cash costs per ounce at the east boulder mine in averaged per ounce  a little higher than plan and substantially higher than the per ounce averaged in in east boulder s case  total cash costs per ore ton mined averaged  exactly on plan but higher than the reported in the year on year difference is mostly attributable to the quality of areas available to mine  an issue recognized and reflected in the original mine plan at east boulder 
capital expenditures at the mine totaled million in compared to million in actual primary development at the east boulder mine advanced about  feet during  lagging the plan  while secondary development advanced  feet in  slightly above plan 
in total  development footage at the east boulder mine was about behind plan  reflecting delays in getting a new development crew in place and operating 
diamond drilling footage totaled about  feet at east boulder in  about behind plan  in part driven by the lower primary development 
the company s sales agreement with ford motor company  which committed of the company s palladium production and of its platinum production from mining  expired at the end of this agreement contained certain guaranteed floor and ceiling prices for metal delivered  as well as a small discount to market 
the company believes it could readily sell all of its mine production on a spot basis into terminal markets with virtually no detrimental effect on market prices 
nevertheless  the company has recently signed a new three year palladium supply agreement with general motors corporation  a one year palladium agreement with basf  a one year platinum supply agreement with tiffany and is engaged in discussions with other potential customers for the remainder of its mined palladium and platinum 
the company expects ultimately to enter into new supply agreements for most of its metal production  but likely without the pricing floors and caps as in past contracts 
the absence of floor prices in any successor contracts will increase the company s financial exposure to low pgm prices  
table of contents while the absence of the ceiling prices in any successor contracts will increase the company s opportunity to realize fully on higher prices 
the company s smelter and base metal refinery in columbus  montana process the pgm ore concentrates from the two mines and also recycles spent pgm catalysts from automotive catalytic converters and from other industrial applications  ultimately recovering palladium  platinum and rhodium from these materials 
during  the company fed about  combined ounces of recycled platinum  palladium and rhodium into the smelter  of which roughly half was from material purchased by the company and the remainder was toll processed on behalf of others for a fee 
total ounces fed were up compared to the  recycling ounces fed in  a year when the auto market was severely depressed and so fewer vehicles were scrapped 
recycling revenues in were million on  combined ounces sold  benefitting from both higher volumes and stronger pgm prices  recycling revenues totaled million on sales of  combined ounces 
in  the company earned million from recycling operations on revenues of million  reflecting a combined average realization including rhodium of  per sold ounce 
by comparison  in the company earned million from recycling operations on revenues of million  with a combined average realization of per sold ounce 
total tons of recycling material processed during  including tolled material  averaged tons per day  up from tons per day in strengthening pgm prices in have created a greater incentive for suppliers to collect recycling material  and during  the company was able to enter into new sourcing arrangements for catalyst material with several suppliers 
the company s total available liquidity  expressed as cash plus short term investments  ended at million  comprised of million of cash and cash equivalents and million of available for sale investments 
in total this represented a small increase over the corresponding year end balance of million  including million of cash and million of liquid investments 
however  also included the expenditure of million of cash as part of the acquisition of marathon pgm corporation  so cash generation in was stronger than the change in the year end balance might indicate 
in fact  cash generated from operations during totaled million  up from million in  driven by the higher pgm prices in at the end of  the company s workforce totaled  employees  down from  in september as the year progressed and pgm prices continued to strengthen  the company concluded to increase its mine development efforts by reactivating the tunnel boring machine at the east boulder mine and by resuming mining on the higher cost east side of the stillwater mine 
this decision entailed hiring additional development crews to accommodate these efforts 
consequently  by the end of  the company s total workforce had been increased to  on december   norimet ltd  a wholly owned subsidiary of mmc norilsk nickel norilsk and the company s majority shareholder  completed a million secondary offering of stillwater shares in the public market and so disposed of its entire equity interest in the company 
prior to completion of the offering it was determined that norimet was unable to locate its original share certificates and the company  the company s transfer agent and affiliates of norilsk  entered into certain indemnification and ancillary arrangements to protect the company and its transfer agent from possible claims relating to the issuance of replacement certificates 
for additional information about these arrangements  see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for a discussion of potential exposure to losses that the company could suffer 
the company s environmental performance continued its excellent track record during environmental compliance is a very high priority in view of the pristine area in which the company operates 
the company has a record of open communication and cooperative  proactive involvement with its neighbors and with local and regional environmental groups 
the company s ground breaking good neighbor agreement with these groups provides a vehicle for facilitating such communication and addressing issues cooperatively 
the company and its neighbors celebrated the tenth anniversary of the agreement during outlook the company s operating guidance for currently includes targeted mine production of about  combined ounces of palladium and platinum at a total consolidated cash cost per ounce of  and capital expenditures of about million 
total cash cost per ounce is a non gaap measure of extraction efficiency please see reconciliation of non gaap measures to costs of revenues for a discussion of how this measure is derived 

table of contents the plan to produce  ounces in takes into account the lower grades realized in the off shaft area of the stillwater mine in and compensates for the shortfall by assuming that some production resumes from the east side of the mine in management s assessment of mining conditions for suggest that ore grades at stillwater are likely to remain a little lower on average than in the past  reflecting the same higher variability in the lower off shaft area as was experienced during these lower realized ore grades centered in the lower off shaft area seem to be mostly the result of having smaller  more variable stopes to mine there than in prior years 
in planning for  the company has taken these lower grades into account and to offset this has planned to resume a limited amount of production on the east side of the mine  which in the past has had higher ore grades but also more difficult mining conditions 
the company s mine plan  taking all this into account  calls for mine production from the combined mining operations of  ounces of palladium and platinum during prominent risks to accomplishing the mine plans include continuing variability of mined ore grades  the pending expiration of the labor agreement with the united steel workers at the end of june  the ability to retain or attract skilled miners as the year progresses  and from a cost perspective  greater than planned cost inflation for key materials 
the targeted combined average total cash cost per ounce of per ounce for the mines compares to the combined average total cash cost per ounce for the year of the increase in reflects a rising cost trend during fourth quarter total cash costs were per ounce plus general inflation for wages and materials  and the effect of higher average sales realizations on royalties and taxes  all partially offset by slightly higher mine production in projected capital expenditures for of million represent an increase of over the million spent during capital spending in and was restricted in order to conserve cash  so the budget includes operational spending of million to compensate for the shortfall in those prior years  spending at a higher rate to replace anticipated production  spending to advance the developed state and significant equipment replacement 
the capital budget also includes developmental spending of million for initial modest capital needs on the newly acquired marathon properties about million and the two long term resource delineation projects along the j m reef  blitz and graham creek  announced during the company s mining permits require that  in conjunction with its mining and processing activities  it must provide adequate financial surety in support of its permit obligations to complete final reclamation and remediation once mining operations cease 
as of december   the company had outstanding approximately million of surety bonds and letters of credit in favor of state and federal agencies to guarantee its final reclamation commitments 
regulatory authorities are currently in the midst of updating an eis  which when finalized will determine whether or not the existing surety amounts are sufficient 
in the interim  however  as the economy weakened late in  the company agreed to increase its surety bonding by an additional million as an interim measure to alleviate concerns aired by the agencies involved and to allow time for the eis to be completed 
upon completion of the eis process  probably during  it is likely that the company will be required to provide additional surety bond coverage 
marathon pgm corporation acquisition on november   the company completed its acquisition of marathon pgm corporation marathon  a canadian exploration company with a number of attractive pgm copper assets 
marathon is a canadian exploration company with promising pgm assets located near the town of marathon at the north end of lake superior in ontario and another pgm exploration position known as bird river in manitoba 
aside from its pgm assets  marathon also held certain prospective gold properties that were spun out into a separate public company just prior to the acquisition 
stillwater has since exercised its option to acquire a equity interest in the new gold company  thereby maintaining a relationship with this talented exploration team 
the marathon pgm assets acquired include two potential resource blocks situated on the larger coldwell complex  a geologic formation that appears to be rich in copper pgm opportunity 
of particular interest to the company is a well defined resource known as the marathon project located near the town of marathon  ontario  canada at the northern extremity of lake superior 
the marathon deposit boasts a completed definitive feasibility study canadian ni compliant that indicates the potential for pgm production of about  ounces per year at a ratio of about to palladium to platinum and annual copper production on the order of million pounds  from an open pit operation 
cost of constructing the mine is currently estimated to be about million to full completion  subject to a final detailed engineering study 
the company intends to fund the project out of internally generated cash flow  possibly with supplemental external financing 
the company is in the process of establishing a project team to focus on development of the marathon pgm reserves 

table of contents the feasibility study anticipates an active mine life of approximately years for this property  although there is resource potential that is expected to extend the mine life 
in conjunction with the acquisition of these properties  certain non pgm exploration properties held by marathon were spun out to the previous marathon shareholders  stillwater has subsequently exercised an option to acquire a equity interest in marathon gold corporation  a non pgm entity 
the marathon project is currently in the permitting stage and if it remains on schedule could reasonably be in production during or capital spending for marathon during is estimated at about million 
along with the marathon project comes another attractive exploration property on the same coldwell complex  known as geordie lake 
the geordie lake property is situated about kilometers to the west of the marathon property and appears to be on a parallel structure within the larger complex 
subsequent to the marathon acquisition  the company announced its intent to acquire properties and exploration rights to additional properties connecting marathon and geordie lake from benton resources corp 
which  in essence  will consolidate ownership of the coldwell complex 
and along with these property acquisitions  the company also retained a competent exploration team with a full understanding of the geology of the coldwell complex to develop the additional resource potential of these properties 
the marathon transaction fits well into the company s long term strategy of expanding and diversifying its mining activities 
the size of this transaction is manageable financially  and the location is politically stable and logistically accessible 
the marathon area is well developed with extensive public infrastructure already established  and there is other active mining in the general vicinity of the project 
the new mine is projected to create a significant number of jobs in an area with relatively high unemployment 
the company s strong focus on environmental stewardship should serve it well in this region 
strategic areas of emphasis for several years now the company s management has focused on three broad areas of strategic emphasis 
while specific initiatives in each area have varied as markets have shifted and the company has progressed  these fundamental strategic directions continue to provide a basic framework for management s efforts to strengthen performance and build value for shareholders 
be a safe  low cost operator the company maintains that companies with safe operations also tend to be well managed and efficient in other important areas 
the company measures safety performance using several criteria  including the frequency and severity of medical reportable incidents and lost time accidents in comparison to the company s own historical performance and relative to other mining operations in the industry 
safety is also assessed in terms of the number and severity of citations issued by msha inspectors during their regular visits to the mine sites 
both measures accident frequency and regulatory compliance are critical elements of the company s safety efforts 
various internal programs support these safety efforts  including annual refresher training and other training programs  pre shift employee inspections of each work area  regular workgroup discussions of current safety issues and incidents  detailed accident investigations to identify core causes  reporting of near misses that had the potential of resulting in injuries  and more rarely so called safety stand downs to re emphasize safety principles as necessary 
the company also responds promptly to correct any safety issues  whether identified internally or by msha inspectors  and to eliminate unsafe work practices 
safety performance at the company s mining operations falls under the regulatory jurisdiction of msha 
msha performs detailed quarterly inspections at each of the company s mine sites and separately investigates any occurrences deemed to pose a significant hazard to employee health and safety 
the company cooperates fully with msha in its compliance responsibilities and maintains its own program of safety training and incident tracking in an effort to ensure that no employee is ever put at risk in carrying out his or her job responsibilities and that all unsafe situations are identified and remediated immediately 
the company s overall safety performance including contractors on site  measured in terms of reportable incidents per  hours worked  averaged a rate of during  a modest improvement over the rate reported for legislation signed into law on july   requires publicly traded mining companies to disclose certain statistics pertaining to their compliance with the mine act 
please see business  risk factors and properties introduction and current operations safety performance for a table containing this required safety reporting 

table of contents the significance of aiming to be a low cost operator deserves some elaboration 
ore grades at the company s operations are some of the best in the world  and consequently total cash costs per ounce for the company s mining operations also rank among the lowest of any primary pgm producer in the industry 
however  because the company s ore contains about times as much palladium as platinum and south african ores typically have about twice as much platinum as palladium  the company s average revenues per ounce are lower and therefore operating margins have tended to be historically tighter than for south african producers 
other significant pgm producers  including norilsk nickel and the canadian nickel operations  produce pgms as by products  and pgms at such operations attract almost no allocated cost 
consequently  the company measures its performance as a low cost operator in competitive terms  both relative to its own historical cost performance and relative to historical market prices for its products 
the importance of low cost operations is amplified now that the palladium floor prices in the company s long term supply agreements have all expired 
in today s market  any new supply agreements that the company may enter into will mostly likely be market based and are unlikely to include pricing floors and ceilings 
without the floor prices  of course  the company will not enjoy the downside price protection such floors have provided in the past when palladium prices have cycled downward 
instead  the company intends to manage through any downward price cycles using several critical operating tactics maintaining sufficient developed state ahead of operations that capital spending could be curtailed during a downturn without any major long term impact  ensuring that the company s operating costs remain competitive and that discretionary commitments can be scaled back when necessary  sustaining the company s balance sheet liquidity and limiting financial leverage to reduce exposure to downturns 
although in theory the company also could hedge its mine production in the financial markets through derivative transactions  the cost of such a strategy would be prohibitively expensive or would require trading away the opportunity for shareholders to benefit fully from an increase in pgm prices 
consequently  the company has no intention of hedging its mine production at this time 
the company does hedge its recycling purchases  locking in a margin on each lot  and also hedges certain critical consumables used in its operations but this has been standard practice for many years 
and  on the other hand without the ceiling prices of the contracts or financial market hedges  our revenues will not be limited as they might otherwise be in the current rising price environment  a position that is expected to benefit the company 
as discussed above  the company estimates that its mine production for will be about  ounces  with a corresponding total cash cost per ounce of  and capital spending on all projects totaling about million for the year 
projected total cash cost per ounce is up about over the average of  but because costs trended up during it is actually lower than the averaged in the fourth quarter 
production in is expected to benefit from the resumption of mining on the east side of the stillwater mine and could also benefit further if ore grades improve in the lower off shaft area of the mine 
the million capital budget for  which as already noted includes some catch up spending on infrastructure to offset lower spending during and  also includes million to refurbish the original electric furnace at the smelter and convert it for slag cleaning  about million for the blitz and graham creek projects  and about million for work at marathon 
expenses for corporate programs are also planned to increase in  as the company moves forward with funding an exploration effort and increases its palladium marketing expenditures 
much of this spending is discretionary and could be scaled back in the event that pgm markets weakened substantially 
management is cautiously optimistic that during a number of the challenges that have limited the company s mining flexibility will largely be resolved 
the first phase installation of the kiruna electric trucks at stillwater mine that will provide more efficient ramp haulage from the deeper portions of the off shaft area a long term project is now nearly complete and should open up more mining alternatives in that part of the mine 
development through a largely barren zone on the west end of the lower off shaft area in the stillwater mine also is nearing completion  allowing access for the first time to the lower west portion of the mine 
the company expects to experience good ore continuity in the lower west  analogous to the upper west area above it  and initial findings in the drifts that have driven through have tended to confirm this expectation 
the lower west is likely to be a primary mining area at stillwater mine over the next decade 
the intent of the higher spending in is to strengthen the developed state of the mines and also  particularly in view of stronger pgm prices  to position the mines in time for a modest expansion of production rates going forward 

table of contents the effect of using up a portion of the developed state at both mines in and means that there are fewer alternatives available for mining if problems develop in a particular area 
this ultimately may be reflected in lower ounce production or in reduced mining efficiency  depending on the circumstances 
the ability to throttle back development in times of economic difficulty  thereby conserving cash  is a significant benefit of advancing the developed state well ahead of mining when pgm prices are strong 
operationally  it is like having money in the bank 
as the economy recovers and strengthens  though  it is important to replace that developed state by increasing investment in mine development 
although manpower on site remains adequate to staff current operations  the company will need to add manpower to support the additional development in and for all of these future operating initiatives 
some staffing increases also will be needed to support the expanded exploration  marketing and development programs 
while it may be a challenge to add all of the new miners needed  the company has resumed recruiting efforts in an effort to meet these increased requirements 
ore production at the stillwater mine averaged  tons of ore per day during  this compares to an average of  ore tons per day produced during the rate of ore production at the east boulder mine averaged  tons per day during  compared to an average of  ore tons per day during during  the company s mining operations produced a total of  ounces of palladium  and  ounces of platinum 
as by products  the mines also produced and sold  ounces of gold   ounces of silver   ounces of rhodium   pounds of copper and  pounds of nickel as nickel sulfate 
by comparison  in the mines produced to  ounces of palladium and  ounces of platinum 
they also produced and sold as by products  ounces of gold   ounces of silver   ounces of rhodium   pounds of copper and  pounds of nickel 
revenues from by product sales totaled million in and million in palladium market development a consortium of south african producers has spent significant sums each year for many decades now marketing platinum 
their efforts have been well rewarded  with platinum positioned as the premier jewelry metal  projecting an image of elegance and high quality 
platinum also is a metal of choice in certain industrial applications where its remarkable catalytic properties are required 
palladium  on the other hand  historically has never enjoyed a comparable level of marketing support and has remained largely an unknown metal to a large swath of consumers 
however  in palladium began to appear as an alternative jewelry metal in china after the price of platinum moved above per ounce in december recognizing this as an opportunity  and identifying the marketing gap  the company stepped forward beginning in  initially putting forward a comparatively modest marketing program that focused on providing technical support to manufacturers and bench jewelers and image advertising at the industry level through the palladium alliance international  a entity organized by the company to facilitate marketing collaborations 
this effort continued on a modest scale until the economic downturn of late and  at which time it was cut back sharply due to economic constraints 
however  in late the company began to resurrect its marketing program  and in will broaden its efforts  with particular emphasis on china 
it also appears that norilsk nickel will launch a major marketing campaign for palladium jewelry in even through the economic downturn  the company maintained marketing representatives in china who continue to provide first hand insight into palladium activity there and maintain contact with key palladium consumers 
the company also sponsors palladium image advertising in chinese media 
china first led the recent trend toward using palladium in jewelry and remains the largest market for it 
according to johnson matthey  consumption of palladium in jewelry declined to just over  ounces in  down from about a million ounces per year prior to the economic downturn  with most of the consumption drop centered in asia 
some of this may be attributable to lower prices for platinum jewelry during the downturn  as the demand for platinum jewelry increased sharply when prices fell in the company s marketing efforts in will refocus on asian consumers 
palladium jewelry is now available in all major markets worldwide  and in january of the uk mandated the hallmarking of all palladium jewelry  formally recognizing it  along with gold  silver and platinum  as a precious jewelry metal 
automotive applications for palladium in catalytic converters are well established for gasoline engines  but diesel engine catalytic technologies generally have been based on platinum 
in recent years  driven mostly by economics  research efforts in the auto industry have focused on how to substitute less expensive palladium for platinum in these applications 
the company has encouraged this research and closely monitored its progress 
reportedly  it is now possible in the laboratory to replace about of the platinum in a diesel system with palladium on nearly a one for one 
table of contents basis  although the average proportion of palladium actually used in production vehicles now is estimated to be closer to 
palladium and platinum also are important players in emerging fuel cell technologies 
other industrial applications for palladium include refinery catalysts  electronics  hydrogen generation and dentistry 
electronic uses that take advantage of palladium s unique characteristics include multi layered ceramic capacitors  high end television screens  and compact discs 
palladium in thin films has a unique ability to pass hydrogen molecules while blocking other impurities  allowing relatively inexpensive production of high purity hydrogen for chemical processes and fuel cells 
palladium alloys used in dental fillings wear well and have an expansion coefficient that closely matches that of the teeth themselves  although other materials tend to be substituted for palladium when its price rises 
growth and diversification the company monitors diversification opportunities in various mineral exploration and development projects  as well as potential merger or acquisition candidates and other business ventures 
it also seeks appropriate opportunities to diversify its existing mining and processing operations  and evaluates potential avenues for vertical integration 
the focus of these diversification efforts is both to establish a broader operating base  reducing the company s sole reliance on the montana properties  and ultimately to build value for the company s shareholders 
recognizing the need to broaden its base  the company over the past several years has successfully expanded its recycling operations into a distinct business segment that has become a meaningful source of income  reducing the company s captive reliance financially on the performance of the mines 
the recycling business has utilized surplus capacity within the company s smelting and refining facilities to generate an additional income stream  requiring relatively little incremental investment in facilities 
as already noted  over the past year or so the company has invested in some new dedicated recycling facilities that are intended to increase the company s capacity to handle recycled material and sharply reduce turnaround times for settlement with suppliers 
the company holds minority investments in two small exploration companies that target pgms and other precious metals 
in the fourth quarter of  the company acquired the pgm assets of marathon pgm corporation  including both a large development property and various exploration holdings 
since then the company also has acquired additional properties adjacent to the marathon project in ontario 
the company also has formed an exploration group aimed at evaluating opportunities related to the marathon holdings and perhaps extending further afield  as well 
the company monitors various later stage mineral development projects  as well as potential merger and acquisition candidates in an effort to diversify the company s financial and operating risk and perhaps add scale 
while the company s primary focus is on properties with potential for pgm production particularly in north america  the pool of opportunities meeting those criteria is limited  and ancillary opportunities outside of pgms that have strategic benefits for the company and are compatible with its existing mining expertise are not ruled out 
thus gold  silver  copper and nickel opportunities or combinations thereof continue to be studied 
management believes that the acquisition of marathon pgm corporation  which has both pgms and copper as described previously  will provide an excellent entry into a development stage project that will utilize the company s resources effectively and establish a strong presence in an attractive north american pgm district

liquidity and capital resources for  net cash provided by operating activities was million compared to million and million for and  respectively 
the company s net cash flow from operating activities is affected by several key factors  including net realized prices for its products  cash costs of production  and the level of pgm production from the mines 
mining productivity rates and ore grades in turn can affect both pgm production and cash costs of production 
net cash flow from operations also includes changes in non cash working capital  including changes to inventories and advances 
at december   the company s available balance of cash and cash equivalents and highly liquid short term investments excluding restricted cash was million and it reported million of debt outstanding 
available cash and cash equivalents at december   was million

the company exchanged million face amount of its outstanding convertible debentures for about million common shares during the fourth quarter of the remaining million of convertible debentures outstanding will reach their date of first call in march  and the company believes most holders are likely to convert their debentures  should the share price be at or above the conversion price  or redeem them at par at that time 
the company  at interest rate levels prevailing at december   will be required to fund approximately million in total interest payments during related to its outstanding debt obligations 
no principal payments against outstanding debt are scheduled to come due in with its current liquidity position  the company has elected not to put in place a revolving credit agreement at this time 
while the lack of a credit agreement may create some vulnerability  the company believes that its liquidity on hand is adequate to cover its needs for the foreseeable future 
during the fourth quarter of  the company filed a million shelf registration statement 
the registration became effective on december   and permits the company to issue any of various public debt or equity 
table of contents instruments for financing purposes so long as the registration statement remains effective 
the company is generating significant cash flow at the current time and will also consider its financing needs as its plans develop and opportunities warrant 
in this connection  the development of the marathon property will require significant capital and the debentures may require cash payments  whether upon maturity or earlier redemption 
management believes that the shelf registration statement may facilitate access to additional liquidity in the future 
however  there is no assurance that debt or equity capital would be available to the company in the public markets in the event the company determines to issue securities under the shelf registration 
in december of  standard and poor s upgraded the company s debt rating from b to b  citing improved market conditions and adequate liquidity 
both moody s investors service and standard and poor s had downgraded the company s corporate credit rating by two notches during as economic conditions deteriorated 
at issue had been the company s strong dependence on its automotive agreements  lack of geographic or product diversity  metal market price volatility  and difficult cost structure 
the company s financial performance is affected by changes in pgm prices 
absent separate hedging arrangements  any change in the price of platinum or palladium generally would flow through almost dollar for dollar to cash flow from operations  subject only to certain costs severance taxes and royalties on mine production which adjust upward or downward with market prices 
at the forecasted mine production level of  combined pgm ounces  a one dollar change in the price of platinum would affect annual cash generated from mining operations by about million  and a corresponding change in the price of palladium would affect annual cash generation from mining operations by about million 
the sensitivity of the recycling business to changes in platinum and palladium prices is more muted and varies according to the provisions in the various recycling agreements 
in the company s recycling activities  upon purchasing recycled material for processing the company simultaneously enters into a fixed forward contract that determines the future selling price of the contained pgms  effectively locking in a sales margin 
changes in the cash costs of production generally flow through dollar for dollar into cash flow from operations 
a reduction due to grade in total mine production of  or about  ounces per year  would reduce cash flow from operations by an estimated million per year at the price and cost levels prevailing at december  during the third quarter of  the company revised its cash management guidelines to extend the available investment maturities on a portion of its cash balances  broaden the suite of permissible investments  and adjust the percentage limits on certain classes of investments

table of contents critical accounting policies mine development expenditures capitalization and amortization mining operations are inherently capital intensive  generally requiring substantial capital investment for the initial and concurrent development and infrastructure of the mine 
many of these expenditures are necessarily incurred well in advance of actual extraction of ore 
underground mining operations such as those conducted by the company require driving adits and sinking shafts that provide access to the underground ore body and construction and development of infrastructure  including electrical and ventilation systems  rail and other forms of transportation  shop facilities  material handling areas and hoisting systems 
ore mining and removal operations require significant underground facilities used to conduct mining operations and to transport the ore out of the mine to processing facilities located above ground 
contemporaneously with mining  additional development is undertaken to provide access to ongoing extensions of the ore body  allowing more ore to be produced 
in addition to the development costs that have been previously incurred  these ongoing development expenditures are necessary to access and support all future mining activities 
mine development expenditures incurred to date to increase existing production  develop new ore bodies or develop mineral property substantially in advance of production are capitalized 
mine development expenditures consist of vertical shafts  multiple surface adits and underground infrastructure development including footwall laterals  ramps  rail and transportation  electrical and ventilation systems  shop facilities  material handling areas  ore handling facilities  dewatering and pumping facilities 
many such facilities are required not only for current operations  but also for all future planned operations 
expenditures incurred to sustain existing production and access specific ore reserve blocks or stopes provide benefit to ore reserve production over limited periods of time secondary development and are charged to operations as incurred 
these costs include ramp and stope access excavations from primary haulage levels footwall laterals  stope material rehandling laydown excavations  stope ore and waste pass excavations and chute installations  stope ventilation raise excavations and stope utility and pipe raise excavations 
the company calculates amortization of capitalized mine development costs by the application of an amortization rate to current production 
the amortization rate for each relevant geological area within a mine is based upon un amortized capitalized mine development costs and the related ore reserves associated with that area 
capital development expenditures are added to the un amortized capitalized mine development costs as the related development assets are placed into service 
in the calculation of the amortization rate  changes in ore reserves are accounted for as a prospective change in estimate 
ore reserves and the further benefit of capitalized mine development costs are based on significant management assumptions 
any changes in these assumptions  such as a change in the mine plan or a change in estimated proven and probable ore reserves could have a material effect on the expected period of benefit resulting in a potentially significant change in the amortization rate and or the valuations of related assets 
the company s proven ore reserves are generally expected to be extracted utilizing its existing mine development infrastructure 
additional capital expenditures will be required to access the company s estimated probable ore reserves 
these anticipated capital expenditures are not included in the current calculation of depletion  depreciation and amortization 
the company s method of accounting for development costs is as follows unamortized costs of the shaft at the stillwater mine and the initial development at the east boulder mine are treated as life of mine infrastructure costs  amortized over total proven and probable reserves at each location  and all ongoing development costs of footwall laterals  ramps and associated facilities are amortized over the ore reserves in the immediate and geologically relevant vicinity of the development 
the calculation of the amortization rate  and therefore the annual amortization charge to operations  could be materially affected to the extent that actual production in the future is different from current forecasts of production based on proven and probable ore reserves 
this would generally occur to the extent that there were significant changes in any of the factors or assumptions used in determining ore reserves 
these factors could include an expansion of proven and probable ore reserves through development activities  differences between estimated and actual costs of mining due to differences in ore grades or metal recovery rates  and differences between actual commodity prices and commodity price assumptions used in the estimation of ore reserves 

table of contents asset impairment the company reviews and evaluates its long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
impairment is considered to exist if total estimated future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying amount of the asset 
the estimation of future cash flows takes into account estimates of recoverable ounces  pgm prices long term sales contract prices and historical pricing trends or third party projections of future prices rather than prices at a point in time as an indicator of longer term future prices  production levels  and capital and reclamation expenditures  all based on life of mine plans and projections 
if the assets are impaired  a determination of fair market value is performed  and if fair market value is lower than the carrying value of the assets  the assets are reduced to their fair market value 
foreign currency transaction with the acquisition during of certain canadian assets  the company now regularly incurs certain capital and operating expenditures in canadian dollars and within canadian entities 
the company has determined that the functional currency for these canadian activities will be the us dollar and therefore reflects all assets  liabilities and expenditures in us dollars for accounting purposes 
the company uses a monthly average exchange rate for converting minor canadian dollar expenditures into us dollars  and uses the actual exchange rate incurred in accounting for larger transactions 
for balance sheet purposes  canadian dollar monetary assets and liabilities are recorded based on the exchange rate at the end of the respective period 
any net accounting difference that results from exchange rate differences is recorded as a foreign exchange gain or loss for the respective period on the consolidated statement of operations 
income taxes with the acquisition during the fourth quarter of of certain canadian assets  the company now is subject to canadian federal and provincial income taxes on its canadian activities as well as to us state and federal income taxes 
income taxes are determined using the asset and liability approach 
this method gives consideration to the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities based on currently enacted tax rates 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
deferred taxes associated with the company s canadian activities are recorded using the assumption that future earning and profits associated with these activities will not be repatriated into the us but will be fully utilized in canada 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
each quarter  management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
a valuation allowance has been provided at december  and  for the portion of the company s net deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not that they will not be realized 
post closure reclamation costs the company recognizes the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset 
the liability is accreted at the end of each period through charges to operating expense 
if the obligation ultimately is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability  the company will recognize a gain or loss at the time of settlement 
accounting for reclamation obligations requires management to make estimates for each mining operation of the future costs the company will incur to complete final reclamation work required to comply with existing laws and regulations 
actual costs incurred in future periods could differ from amounts estimated 
additionally  future changes to environmental laws and regulations could increase the extent of reclamation and remediation work that the company is required to perform 
any such increases in future costs could materially impact the amounts charged to operations for reclamation and remediation 

table of contents the company reviewed its asset retirement assumptions at december  and  and recorded a reduction at december   of million and million for the stillwater mine and the east boulder mine  respectively  due to an increase in the estimated mine lives of both mines 
no corresponding adjustment was required at december  see note asset retirement obligation to the company s audited consolidated financial statements for further information 
derivative instruments the company from time to time enters into derivative financial instruments  including fixed forward sales  cashless put and call option collars and financially settled forward sales to manage the effect of changes in the prices of palladium and platinum on the company s revenue 
derivatives are reported on the balance sheet at fair value and  if the derivative is not designated as a hedging instrument  changes in fair value are recognized in earnings in the period of change 
if the derivative is designated as a hedge and to the extent such hedge is determined to be highly effective  changes in fair value are either a offset by the change in fair value of the hedged asset or liability if applicable or b reported as a component of other comprehensive income in the period of change  and subsequently recognized in the determination of net income in the period the offsetting hedged transaction occurs 
the company primarily uses derivatives to hedge metal prices and to manage interest rate risk 
the company also enters into financially settled forwards related to its recycling segment which are not accounted for as cash flow hedges 
the realized and unrealized gains or losses are recognized in net income in each period 
see note derivative instruments to the company s audited consolidated financial statements for further information 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to market risk  including the effects of adverse changes in metal prices and interest rates as discussed below 
commodity price risk the company produces and sells palladium  platinum and associated by product metals directly to its customers and also through third parties 
as a result  financial performance can be materially affected when prices for these commodities fluctuate 
in order to manage commodity price risk and to reduce the impact of fluctuation in prices  the company has entered into long term agreements with suppliers and customers  from time to time has employed various derivative financial instruments and attempts to maintain adequate liquidity to sustain operations during a downturn in pgm prices 
because the company hedges only with instruments that have a high correlation with the value of the hedged transactions  changes in the fair value of the derivatives are expected to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the value of the hedged transaction 
the company s remaining long term automotive supply agreement with ford motor company expired on december  the floor prices in that agreement applied to of the company s mined platinum ounces and of the company s mined palladium ounces 
replacement supply agreements are not likely to include any comparable floor price protection  and consequently the company s mining revenues going forward will be more fully exposed to prevailing market prices 
without these pricing provisions  the risk increases that the company may not be able to operate profitably during any future downturns in pgm prices 
the company customarily enters into fixed forward sales and from time to time in the past has entered into financially settled forward sales transactions that may or may not be accounted for as cash flow hedges to mitigate the price risk in its pgm recycling and mine production activities 
under these fixed forward transactions  typically metals contained in the spent catalytic materials are sold forward at the time the materials are purchased and then are delivered against the fixed forward contracts when the finished ounces are recovered 
the company believes such transactions qualify for the exception to hedge accounting treatment provided for in the accounting literature and so has elected to account for these transactions as normal purchases and normal sales 
financially settled forward sales provide another mechanism to offset fluctuations in metal prices associated with future production  particularly in circumstances where the company elects to retain control of the final disposition of the metal 
in financially settled forward sales  the parties agree in advance to a net financial settlement in the future based on the difference between the market price of the metal on the settlement date and a forward price set at inception 
consequently  at the settlement date  the company receives the difference between the forward price and the market 
table of contents price if the market price is below the forward price  and the company pays the difference between the forward price and the market price if the market price is above the forward price 
no metal changes hands between the parties in these financially settled transactions 
the company generally has accounted for financially settled forward transactions as cash flow hedges  as they are not eligible for treatment as normal purchases and normal sales 
however  if the company determines not to document them as cash flow hedges  these transactions are marked to market in each accounting period and the realized and unrealized gains or losses are recognized in net income in each period 
as of december  and  the company was not party to any financially settled forward agreements 
periodically  the company also has entered into financially settled forwards related to its recycling segment which are not accounted for as cash flow hedges 
the realized and unrealized gains or losses on such transactions therefore are recognized in net income in each period 
interest rate risk at december   all of the company s outstanding long term debt was subject to fixed rates of interest 
interest income on payments to the company s recycling suppliers is generally linked to short term inter bank rates 
the company s convertible debentures and industrial revenue bonds do not contain financial covenants  other than change in control protection and  in the case of the convertible debentures  investor make whole provisions 
consequently  the company is not subject to conventional financial covenants at this time 
foreign currency risk with the acquisition of certain canadian assets during the fourth quarter of  the company has gained some modest exposure to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the canadian dollar and the us dollar 
while this exposure is currently limited to canadian dollar cash deposits and expenses incurred for the services of a few canadian employees and contractors along with some associated support costs  as the company s commitments there expand in the future  the exposure may become more material 
the company does not hedge this exposure at present  but may consider doing so in the future as the scale of its canadian operations grows
