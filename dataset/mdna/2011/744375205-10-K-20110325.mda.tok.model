critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the financial statements included in item of this form k 
management believes the most critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition the company is in the business of performing drug testing and reporting the results thereof 
the company s drug testing services include training for collection of samples and storage of positive samples for its customers for an agreed upon fee per unit tested of samples 
the revenues are recognized when the predominant deliverable  drug testing  is provided and reported to the customer 
the company recognizes revenue in accordance with accounting standards codification asc  revenue recognition 
in accordance with asc  the company considers testing  training and storage elements as one unit of accounting for revenue recognition purposes  as the training and storage costs are de minimis and do not have stand alone value to the customer 
the company recognizes revenue as the service is performed and reported to the customer  since the predominant deliverable in each arrangement is the testing of the units 
the company also provides expert testimony  when and if necessary  to support the results of the tests  which is generally billed separately and recognized as the services are provided 
deferred revenue represents payments received in advance of the performance of drug testing procedures  generally in relation to the personal drug testing kits pdt deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when the underlying test results are delivered 
with respect to a portion of these transactions  there may be instances where the customer ultimately does not require performance 
revenue is then recognized when the company can reasonably  reliably and objectively determine that it is remote that performance will be required for an estimable portion of transactions 
the company recorded  approximately   and  of revenue in the results of operations for the years ended december    and  respectively  related to test kits that were sold for which the company s obligations to provide servic e were deemed remote 
estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates  including bad debts and income tax valuation  and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management s assessment of the ability to collect amounts owed to it by its customers 
management reviews its accounts receivable aging for doubtful accounts and uses a methodology based on calculating the allowance using a combination of factors including the age of the receivable along with management s judgment to identify accounts that may not be collectible 
the company routinely assesses the financial strength of its customers and  as a consequence  believes that its accounts receivable credit risk exposure is limited 
the company maintains an allowance for potential credit losses but historically has not experienced any significant losses related to individual customers or groups of customers in any particular industry or geographic area 
bad debt expense has b een within management s expectations 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes using the liability method  which requires the company to recognize a current tax liability or asset for current taxes payable or refundable and a deferred tax liability or asset for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities to the extent that they are realizable 
deferred tax expense benefit results from the net change in deferred tax assets and liabilities during the year 
a deferred tax valuation allowance is required if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the company had net deferred tax assets in the amount of  at december   which the company believes are fully realizable based upon expected future taxable income  which the company s believes is reasonably attainable in light of previous operating results during the past three years 
the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and could be subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
these audits may involve complex issues  which may require an extended period of time to resolve 
the company has provided for its estimated taxes payable in the accompanying financial statements 
interest and penalties related to income tax matters are recognized as a general and administrative expense 
the company did not have any unrecognized tax benefits and did not have any interest or penalties accrued as of december  or the company does not expect the unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly over the next twelve months 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of the company s accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result
