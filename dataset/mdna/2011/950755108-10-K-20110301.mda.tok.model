overview we operate in the truckload and logistics sectors of the transportation industry 
in the truckload sector  we focus on transporting consumer nondurable products that generally ship more consistently throughout the year 
in the logistics sector  besides managing transportation requirements for individual customers  we provide additional sources of truck capacity  alternative modes of transportation  a global delivery network and systems analysis to optimize transportation needs 
our success depends on our ability to efficiently and effectively manage our resources in the delivery of truckload transportation and logistics services to our customers 
resource requirements vary with customer demand  which may be subject to seasonal or general economic conditions 
our ability to adapt to changes in customer transportation requirements is essential to efficiently deploy resources and make capital investments in tractors and trailers with respect to our truckload segment or obtain qualified third party capacity at a reasonable price with respect to our vas segment 
although our business volume is not highly concentrated  we may also be affected by our customers financial failures or loss of customer business 
operating revenues reported in our operating statistics table under results of operations are categorized as i trucking revenues  net of fuel surcharge  ii trucking fuel surcharge revenues  iii non trucking revenues  including vas  and iv other operating revenues 
trucking revenues  net of fuel surcharge  and trucking fuel surcharge revenues are generated by the six operating fleets in the truckload segment dedicated  regional  van  expedited  temperature controlled and flatbed 
non trucking revenues  including vas  are generated primarily by the four operating units in our vas segment brokerage  freight management  intermodal and wgl  and a small amount is generated by the truckload segment 
other operating revenues are generated from other business activities such as third party equipment maintenance and equipment leasing 
in  trucking revenues net of fuel surcharge and trucking fuel surcharge revenues accounted for of total operating revenues  and non trucking and other operating revenues accounted for of total operating revenues 
trucking revenues  net of fuel surcharge  are typically generated on a per mile basis and also include revenues such as stop charges  loading unloading charges and equipment detention charges 
because fuel surcharge revenues fluctuate in response to changes in fuel costs  we identify them separately in the operating statistics table and exclude them from the statistical calculations to provide a more meaningful comparison between periods 
the key statistics used to evaluate trucking revenues  net of fuel surcharge  are i average revenues per tractor per week  ii average revenues per mile total and loaded  iii average annual miles per tractor  iv average percentage of empty miles miles without trailer cargo  v average trip length in loaded miles and vi average number of tractors in service 
general economic conditions  seasonal trucking industry freight patterns and industry capacity are important factors that impact these statistics 
our truckload segment also generates a small amount of revenues categorized as non trucking revenues  related to shipments delivered to or from mexico where the truckload segment utilizes a third party capacity provider 
we exclude such revenues from the statistical calculations 
our most significant resource requirements are company drivers  independent contractors  tractors  trailers and equipment operating costs such as fuel and related fuel taxes  driver pay  insurance and supplies and maintenance 
to mitigate our risk to fuel price increases  we recover from our customers additional fuel surcharges that generally recoup a majority of the increased fuel costs  however  we cannot assure that current recovery levels will continue in future periods 
our financial results are also affected by company driver and independent contractor availability and the markets for new and used revenue equipment 
we are self insured for a significant portion of bodily injury  property damage and cargo claims  workers compensation claims  and employee health claims supplemented by premium based insurance coverage above certain dollar levels 
for that reason  our financial results may also be affected by driver safety  medical costs  weather  legal and regulatory environments and insurance coverage costs to protect against catastrophic losses 
the operating ratio is a common industry measure used to evaluate our profitability and that of our truckload segment operating fleets 
the operating ratio consists of operating expenses expressed as a percentage of operating revenues 
the most significant variable expenses that impact the truckload segment are driver salaries and benefits  fuel  fuel taxes included in taxes and licenses expense  payments to independent contractors included in rent and 
table of contents purchased transportation expense  supplies and maintenance and insurance and claims 
these expenses generally vary based on the number of miles generated 
we also evaluate these costs on a per mile basis to adjust for the impact on the percentage of total operating revenues caused by changes in fuel surcharge revenues  per mile rates charged to customers and non trucking revenues 
as discussed further in the comparison of operating results for to  several industry wide issues could cause costs to increase in these issues include shortages of drivers or independent contractors  changing fuel prices  higher new truck and trailer purchase prices  compliance with new or proposed regulations and changes in the used equipment market 
our main fixed costs include depreciation expense for tractors and trailers and equipment licensing fees included in taxes and licenses expense 
the truckload segment requires substantial cash expenditures for tractor and trailer purchases 
we fund these purchases with net cash from operations and financing available under our existing credit facilities  as management deems necessary 
we provide non trucking services primarily through the four operating units within our vas segment 
unlike our truckload segment  the vas segment is less asset intensive and is instead dependent upon qualified employees  information systems and qualified third party capacity providers 
the largest expense item related to the vas segment is the cost of purchased transportation we pay to third party capacity providers 
this expense item is recorded as rent and purchased transportation expense 
other operating expenses consist primarily of salaries  wages and benefits 
we evaluate vas s financial performance by reviewing the gross margin percentage revenues less rent and purchased transportation expenses expressed as a percentage of revenues and the operating income percentage 
the gross margin percentage can be impacted by the rates charged to customers and the costs of securing third party capacity 
we generally do not have contracted long term rates for the cost of third party capacity 
results of operations the following operating statistics table sets forth certain industry data regarding our freight revenues and operations for the periods indicated

net of fuel surcharge revenues 
empty refers to miles without trailer cargo 

table of contents the following table sets forth the revenues  operating expenses and operating income for the truckload segment 
revenues for the truckload segment include non trucking revenues of million in  million in and million in  as described on page truckload transportation services amounts in s revenues operating expenses operating income higher fuel prices and higher fuel surcharge revenues increase our consolidated operating ratio and the truckload segment s operating ratio when fuel surcharges are reported on a gross basis as revenues versus netting against fuel expenses 
eliminating fuel surcharge revenues  which are generally a more volatile source of revenue  provides a more consistent basis for comparing the results of operations from period to period 
the following table calculates the truckload segment s operating ratio as if fuel surcharges are excluded from total revenues and instead reported as a reduction of operating expenses 
truckload transportation services amounts in s revenues less trucking fuel surcharge revenues revenues  net of fuel surcharges operating expenses less trucking fuel surcharge revenues operating expenses  net of fuel surcharges operating income the following table sets forth the vas segment s non trucking revenues  rent and purchased transportation expense  gross margin  other operating expenses and operating income 
other operating expenses for the vas segment primarily consist of salaries  wages and benefits expense 
vas also incurs smaller expense amounts in the supplies and maintenance  depreciation  rent and purchased transportation excluding third party transportation costs  insurance  communications and utilities and other operating expense categories 
value added services amounts in s revenues rent and purchased transportation expense gross margin other operating expenses operating income compared to operating revenues operating revenues increased in compared to trucking revenues  excluding fuel surcharges  increased due primarily to a increase in average revenues per total mile 
a decrease in the average number of tractors in service was substantially offset by a increase in average monthly miles per tractor 
the truckload freight market improved throughout compared to  however  the level of improvement was better in the first half of the year than in the latter half 
the average weekly pre booked percentage of loads to trucks pre books for the one way truckload fleets in were better than those in throughout much of the year 
however  beginning in september  freight volumes softened and average weekly pre books for the remainder of were comparable to freight trends in our one way truckload business were about the same in january as they were in january freight trends have improved in february compared to the same period in severe winter storms during portions of january and early february have negatively impacted the mileage productivity of our trucks 
the average number of tractors in service decreased to  in from  in we currently plan to maintain our total truck count at approximately  trucks until our annual truckload segment operating income percentage is at least 
our primary objectives are to expand our operating income percentage and improve our returns on assets  equity and capital  while providing our expanded portfolio of services for our customers 

table of contents average revenues per loaded mile  excluding fuel surcharge  increased to in from in in comparison  average revenues per total mile increased because our average percentage of empty miles improved 
the improved freight market during  combined with rising contractual pricing and higher spot market rates  resulted in the increased revenue per mile 
weak market conditions in resulted in a high level of customer bid activity in the first half of  which contributed to lower rate levels in and early improving market conditions in  aided by a decreasing supply of truck capacity  enabled us to negotiate rate increases for some of our contractual business which became effective in the latter half of in the first half of  a significant amount of our committed business is available for rate review with customers 
the average percentage of empty miles improved by basis points from in to in on a per trip basis  empty miles declined from miles per trip in to miles per trip in improved freight market conditions and our proactive fleet management decisions enabled us to be more selective with our freight choices  resulting in fewer empty miles 
for freight management and statistical reporting purposes  we classify a mile without cargo in the trailer as an empty mile or deadhead mile  thus  empty miles include those empty miles generated by our dedicated fleets  most of which are billable to our dedicated customers 
average annual miles per tractor increased by from to  as more trips per tractor were offset by a shorter average trip length 
the average trip length in miles loaded decreased by miles  or  in compared to this decrease is the result of having fewer medium to long haul van trucks and more trucks in the shorter haul regional and dedicated fleet operations 
this trend has occurred since when we began to reduce the size of our medium to long haul van fleet 
fuel surcharge revenues represent collections from customers for the higher cost of fuel 
these revenues increased to million in from million in in response to higher average fuel prices in to lessen the effect of fluctuating fuel prices on our margins  we collect fuel surcharge revenues from our customers 
our fuel surcharge programs are designed to i recoup higher fuel costs from customers when fuel prices rise and ii provide customers with the benefit of lower fuel costs when fuel prices decline 
our fuel surcharge standard is a one cent per mile rate increase for every five cent per gallon increase in the doe weekly retail on highway diesel prices 
this standard is used for many fuel surcharge programs 
some customers also have their own standard fuel surcharge program for carriers 
these programs generally enable us to recover a majority  but not all  of the fuel price increases 
the remaining portion is generally not recoverable because it results from empty miles which are not billable to customers  out of route miles and truck idle time 
fuel prices that change rapidly in short time periods also impact our recovery because the surcharge rate in most programs only changes once per week 
in a rapidly rising fuel price market  there is generally a several week delay between the payment of higher fuel prices and surcharge recovery 
in a rapidly declining fuel price market  the opposite generally occurs  and there is a temporary higher surcharge recovery compared to the price paid for fuel 
we continue to diversify our business model 
our goal is to attain a more balanced revenue portfolio comprised of one way truckload which includes regional  medium to long haul van and expedited  specialized which includes dedicated  flatbed and temperature controlled and logistics which includes the vas segment services 

table of contents vas revenues are generated by its four operating units and exclude revenues for vas shipments transferred to the truckload segment  which are recorded as trucking revenues by the truckload segment 
vas revenues increased to million in from million in most of the revenue increase occurred in the brokerage and wgl units 
the gross number of vas freight shipments increased by year over year 
vas shifted about the same number of shipments not committed to third party capacity providers to our truckload segment  thus the net number of vas shipments increased by 
vas gross margin dollars increased to million in from million in however  the vas gross margin percentage decreased from in to in because of the higher cost of third party carrier capacity in an improving freight market 
the following table shows the changes that are described above in shipment volume and average revenue excluding logistics fee revenue per shipment for all vas shipments difference change total vas shipments less non committed shipments to truckload segment net vas shipments average revenue per shipment brokerage revenues increased in compared to due primarily to increased shipment volume 
brokerage gross margin dollars grew at a lower percentage rate  and the gross margin percentage declined by basis points due to the higher cost of third party capacity 
intermodal revenues increased  and its gross margin percentage and operating results improved in compared to wgl revenues grew  while the gross margin percentage and operating results decreased significantly due to a decrease in the number of higher margin shipments related to several international projects that ended during the latter part of second quarter operating expenses our operating ratio operating expenses expressed as a percentage of operating revenues was in compared to in expense items that impacted the overall operating ratio are described on the following pages 
the tables on page show the operating ratios and operating margins for our two reportable segments  truckload and vas 
the following table sets forth the cost per total mile of operating expense items for the truckload segment for the periods indicated 
we evaluate operating costs for this segment on a per mile basis  which is a better measurement for comparing the results of operations from year to year 
increase decrease per mile salaries  wages and benefits fuel supplies and maintenance taxes and licenses insurance and claims depreciation rent and purchased transportation communications and utilities other independent contractor costs are included in rent and purchased transportation expense 
independent contractors supply their own tractors and drivers and are responsible for their operating expenses including driver pay  fuel  supplies and maintenance and fuel taxes 
independent contractor miles as a percentage of total miles were in compared to in this slight increase in independent contractor miles as a percentage of total miles shifted costs from other expense categories to the rent and purchased transportation category 
due to this increase  we estimate that rent and purchased transportation expense for the truckload segment was higher by approximately cents per total mile  and other expense categories had offsetting decreases on a total mile basis as follows i salaries  wages and benefits  cent  ii fuel  cent  and iii depreciation  cent 

table of contents salaries  wages and benefits in the truckload segment increased cents per mile on a total mile basis in compared to higher expense for workers compensation claims and unemployment taxes were the primary factors contributing to the increase in salaries  wages and benefits 
the workers compensation increase resulted primarily from increased negative loss development on existing claims and an increased cost of new claims 
our unemployment tax expense increased by million in from because various states in which we operate significantly raised their required unemployment tax contribution rates in we expect unemployment tax expense to be comparable to smaller increases in driver and non driver wages were offset by lower student pay due to a decrease in the average number of active trainer teams 
the higher cost per mile of salaries  wages and benefits expense for compared to was offset slightly by the shift from this expense category to rent and purchased transportation expense because of the increase in independent contractor miles as a percentage of total miles 
during  we decreased the company matching contribution percentage for our k plan by half  and effective january   we restored it to the previous level 
we expect this change to increase our k contribution expense by about million in compared to non driver salaries  wages and benefits in the non trucking vas segment increased in compared to vas handled more shipments in compared to  including those transferred to the truckload segment  but the net shipments retained by vas increased by 
we renewed our workers compensation insurance coverage for the policy year beginning april  our coverage levels are the same as the prior policy year 
we continue to maintain a self insurance retention of million per claim 
our workers compensation insurance premiums for the policy year beginning april are slightly lower than the previous policy year  due primarily to a lower premium rate per payroll dollar 
the driver recruiting and retention market became more competitive beginning in second quarter which continues into first quarter while historically higher national unemployment rates have aided our driver recruiting and retention efforts  we believe that an improved freight market and related increase in driver demand  extended unemployment benefit payment programs and changing industry safety regulations see regulation on page are tightening driver supply 
during third quarter  we implemented proactive measures that successfully improved our driver recruitment and retention despite the competitive driver market 
while we are not immune to changes in the driver market  we continue to believe our position in the current market is better than that of many competitors because over of our driving jobs are in more attractive  shorter haul regional and dedicated fleet operations that enable these drivers to get home more frequently 
as economic conditions improve  however  competition for qualified drivers has increased  and we expect it will become more challenging in we are unable to predict whether we will experience future driver shortages 
if such a shortage were to occur and driver pay rate increases became necessary to attract and retain drivers  our results of operations would be negatively impacted to the extent that we could not obtain corresponding freight rate increases 
in march  the united states congress passed health care reform legislation known as the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act 
the legislation largely maintains employer based health care systems  employee retirement income security act erisa protections and state regulation under the federal framework of rules for insured businesses 
some key provisions of the legislation became effective in such as expanded dependent coverage and the elimination of pre existing conditions for children  and other provisions become effective in we have been working with our primary health care provider  blue cross blue shield of nebraska  to understand  prepare for and comply with the legislated changes 
many detailed aspects of the legislation are yet to be determined 
at this time  it is difficult to determine the precise impact on us  however  we currently estimate that our health care costs will increase approximately in as a result of this legislation  not considering health care inflation which has been increasing at a rate of per year 
such future cost increases could be more or less as more regulatory provisions are determined and become effective 
fuel increased cents per mile for the truckload segment due to higher average diesel fuel prices 
average diesel fuel prices in were cents per gallon higher than in  a increase 
we continue to employ fuel saving measures such as i limiting truck engine idle time  ii lowering non billable miles  iii utilizing aerodynamic  more fuel efficient trucks in the company truck fleet and iv equipping company trucks with apus or diesel fired heater units 
these measures resulted in a improvement in fuel miles per gallon mpg in compared to we intend to continue these and other environmentally conscious initiatives  including our active participation as an epa smartway transport partner 
the smartway transport partnership is a national voluntary program developed by epa and freight industry representatives to reduce greenhouse gases and air pollution and promote cleaner  more efficient ground freight transportation 
we have historically been successful recouping a majority  but not all  of fuel cost increases through our fuel surcharge program 
when fuel prices rise rapidly  a negative earnings lag occurs because the cost of fuel rises immediately and the market indexes used to determine fuel surcharges increase at a slower pace 
as a result  during rising fuel price periods  the negative impact of fuel on our financial results is more significant 
in a period of declining fuel prices  we generally experience a temporary favorable earnings effect because fuel costs decline at a faster pace than the market indexes used to determine fuel surcharge collections 

table of contents for january and february of  the average diesel fuel price per gallon was approximately cents higher than the average diesel fuel price per gallon in the same period of and approximately cents higher than the average for first quarter crude oil prices began to rise significantly beginning the last full week of february due to geopolitical uncertainty in some oil producing nations 
diesel fuel prices have also begun to rise and would be expected to increase further if crude oil prices remain high or increase further 
as described above  periods of rising fuel prices generally result in a negative effect on our financial results 
shortages of fuel  increases in fuel prices and petroleum product rationing can have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability 
we are unable to predict whether fuel price levels will increase or decrease in the future or the extent to which fuel surcharges will be collected from customers 
as of december   we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations 
supplies and maintenance for the truckload segment increased cents per total mile in compared to the higher maintenance costs resulted primarily from an increase in the average age and odometer mileage of our company truck fleet 
because of the ongoing cost increases for new trucks and the weak used truck market  we extended the replacement cycle for company owned tractors in a longer replacement cycle results in higher maintenance costs  including maintenance that is not covered by warranty  and results in more tires being purchased and expensed as replacement tires  rather than capitalized as part of the equipment cost when new trucks are placed in service 
however  it avoids higher depreciation from the more expensive trucks and offsets a portion of the increased maintenance costs 
we have also begun to incur higher maintenance expenses on apus  which along with the depreciation expense on the units partially offsets the resulting lower fuel expense incurred 
we expect the average age and odometer mileage of our company truck fleet to decrease in based on our anticipated capital expenditures for new trucks 
in recent months  the price of natural rubber has increased as global demand outpaces supply of this raw material  and prices are expected to remain high in coming months 
natural rubber is used for the production of tires  and most large tire producers have raised tire prices in and we have contracted pricing arrangements in place with our large tire vendors  but we may become subject to increased prices upon the expiration of these contracts in additionally  this shortage could affect availability of new tires  and thus  our truck productivity 
taxes and licenses for the truckload segment decreased cents per total mile in compared to due to a decrease in fuel taxes per mile resulting from the improvement in the company truck mpg 
an improved mpg results in fewer gallons of diesel fuel purchased and consequently less fuel taxes paid 
insurance and claims for the truckload segment decreased cents per total mile in compared to the decrease is primarily the result of lower expense related to smaller liability claims due to a significantly lower severity of claims and a lower frequency of claims in compared to  and  to a lesser extent  lower expense related to large liability claims due to improved loss development on older liability claims 
the larger portion of our insurance and claims expense results from our claim experience and claim development under our self insurance program  the smaller portion results from insurance premiums for high dollar claim coverage 
we renewed our liability insurance policies on august  and continue to be responsible for the first million per claim with an annual million aggregate for claims between million and million and an annual aggregate of million for claims in excess of million and less than million 
we maintain liability insurance coverage with insurance carriers substantially in excess of the million per claim 
our liability insurance premiums for the policy year that began august  are slightly higher than the previous policy year  increasing less than cents per total mile 
depreciation expense for the truckload segment decreased cents per total mile in compared to due to a lower ratio of trailers to tractors and more trailers becoming fully depreciated  offset partially by a higher tractor depreciation resulting from the higher cost of new trucks 
depreciation expense was historically affected by two changes to engine emissions standards imposed by the epa that became effective in october and in january  resulting in increased truck purchase costs 
we began to take delivery of trucks with the standard engines in first quarter to replace older trucks in our fleet 
a final set of more rigorous epa mandated emissions standards became effective for all new engines manufactured after january  trucks with standard engines have a higher purchase price approximately  to  more per truck than trucks manufactured to meet the standards but may be more fuel efficient 
in late  we received a small number of engines that meet the standards  and in  we bought a limited number of new trucks with standard engines to replace older trucks we sold or traded 
depreciation expense per mile is expected to increase in due to an increase in prices for new trucks compared to we remain committed to balancing the ongoing investment required to maintain a best in class fleet while focusing on the lowest operating cost model for our customers 
we continue to invest in environmentally friendly equipment solutions such as aerodynamic trucks  idling reduction systems  trailer skirting  wide based tires  and tire inflation systems 

table of contents as of december   of the engines in our fleet of company owned trucks were manufactured by caterpillar 
in september  caterpillar announced it would not produce on highway engines for use in the united states that would comply with the epa engine emissions standards  but caterpillar would continue to sell on highway engines internationally 
in  it was estimated that approximately one million trucks in the us domestic market have caterpillar heavy duty engines  and caterpillar has stated it will fully support these engines going forward 
rent and purchased transportation expense consists mainly of payments to third party capacity providers in the vas segment and other non trucking operations and payments to independent contractors in the truckload segment 
the payments to third party capacity providers generally vary depending on changes in the volume of services generated by the vas segment 
as a percentage of vas revenues  vas rent and purchased transportation expense increased to in compared to in rent and purchased transportation expense for the truckload segment increased cents per total mile in due primarily to increased fuel prices that resulted in higher reimbursements to independent contractors for fuel  as well as a shift to rent and purchased transportation expense from salaries  wages and benefits and several other expense categories because of the increase in independent contractor truck miles as a percentage of total miles 
fuel reimbursements to independent contractors amounted to million in compared to million in our customer fuel surcharge programs do not differentiate between miles generated by company owned and independent contractor trucks 
challenging operating conditions continue to make independent contractor recruitment and retention difficult 
such conditions include inflationary cost increases that are the responsibility of independent contractors and a shortage of financing available to independent contractors for equipment 
we have historically been able to add company owned tractors and recruit additional company drivers to offset any decrease in the number of independent contractors 
if a shortage of independent contractors and company drivers occurs  increases in per mile settlement rates for independent contractors and driver pay rates for company drivers may become necessary to attract and retain these drivers 
this could negatively affect our results of operations to the extent that we would not be able to obtain corresponding freight rate increases 
other operating expenses for the truckload segment decreased cents per mile in gains on sales of assets primarily trucks and trailers are reflected as a reduction of other operating expenses and are reported net of sales related expenses which include costs to prepare the equipment for sale 
gains on sales of assets increased to million in from million in the market for the sale of used trucks and trailers remained fairly stable in the first half of and began to improve in third quarter  and that trend accelerated in fourth quarter during  we realized higher average gains per truck and sold more trailers 
we believe our wholly owned subsidiary and used truck retail network  fleet truck sales  is one of the larger class used truck and equipment retail entities in the united states 
fleet truck sales continues to be our resource for remarketing our used trucks and trailers  in addition to trading used trucks to original equipment manufacturers when purchasing new trucks 
other expense income we recorded interest income of million in compared to million in income taxes our effective income tax rate income taxes expressed as a percentage of income before income taxes decreased to for versus for the lower income tax rate is attributed to higher income before income taxes  which caused non deductible expenses  such as driver per diem  to comprise a smaller percentage of our income before income taxes 
compared to operating revenues operating revenues decreased in compared to excluding fuel surcharge revenues  trucking revenues decreased due primarily to an decrease in the average number of tractors in service as discussed further below  a decrease in average annual miles per tractor and a decrease in average revenues per total mile 
the truckload freight market  as measured by our pre books  were challenging throughout much of weekly pre books were lower than the corresponding percentage in all but a few weeks during the first nine months of pre books improved in mid september and continued to improve through the end of the year  and pre books for such period were also higher than the prior year 
in comparison  pre books declined during fourth quarter freight volumes showed some seasonal improvement as third quarter progressed and continued to improve in fourth quarter a portion of the improved pre booked percentage was due to fewer trucks  and a portion was due to more loads 

table of contents the average number of tractors in service decreased to  in from  in freight demand softness caused by the weak economy and excess truck capacity made for a challenging freight market during much of and as a result  to better match the volume of freight with the number of trucks and improve profitability  we reduced the size of our van fleet during and to approximately trucks at the end of this decrease in the van fleet was partially offset by an increase in the regional fleet 
our van fleet has the most exposure to the spot freight market and faced the most operational and competitive challenges in the difficult market conditions 
the softer freight market during  combined with excess truck capacity in the market and a high level of customer bid activity in the first half of  caused continued pressure on freight rates 
these factors resulted in a decrease in revenue per loaded mile  excluding fuel surcharge  from in to in revenue per total mile decreased only from to  as our average percentage of empty miles improved 
the average percentage of empty miles improved by percentage points from in to in on a per trip basis  empty miles declined from miles per trip in to miles per trip in fuel surcharge revenues decreased to million in from million in in response to lower average fuel prices in vas revenues decreased to million in from million in due to i a reduction in the average revenue per shipment due to lower fuel prices and customer rates and ii shifting more shipments not committed to third party capacity providers to our truckload segment to help cushion the impact of a soft freight market 
these decreases were partially offset by a increase in the number of vas freight shipments 
vas gross margin dollars decreased to million in from million in on the lower revenue because of the reasons noted above 
however  the vas gross margin percentage improved from in to in due to a decline in fuel prices and a lower cost of third party capacity 
the following table shows the changes that are described above in shipment volume and average revenue excluding logistics fee revenue per shipment for all vas shipments difference change total vas shipments less non committed shipments to truckload segment net vas shipments average revenue per shipment brokerage revenues decreased in compared to because of the factors described in the paragraph above  however  the brokerage gross margin percentage improved by basis points due to a decline in fuel prices and a lower cost of third party capacity 
freight management revenues declined due to reduced shipments with existing customers resulting from a decline in certain customers overall shipment levels 
intermodal revenues decreased  and its gross margin percentage decreased by basis points because of a weak and competitive intermodal pricing market in wgl revenues grew  and it also achieved gross margin and operating income improvement  resulting from increased shipment volumes 
operating expenses our operating ratio was in compared to in expense items that impacted the overall operating ratio are described on the following pages 
the tables on page show the operating ratios and operating margins for our two reportable segments  truckload and vas 

table of contents the following table sets forth the cost per total mile of operating expense items for the truckload segment for the periods indicated 
increase decrease per mile salaries  wages and benefits fuel supplies and maintenance taxes and licenses insurance and claims depreciation rent and purchased transportation communications and utilities other independent contractor miles as a percentage of total miles were in compared to in this decrease in independent contractor miles as a percentage of total miles shifted costs from the rent and purchased transportation category to other expense categories 
due to this decrease  we estimate that rent and purchased transportation expense for the truckload segment was lower by approximately cents per total mile  and other expense categories had offsetting increases on a total mile basis as follows i salaries  wages and benefits  cent  ii fuel  cent  and iii depreciation  cent 
we implemented numerous cost saving programs throughout examples of these cost saving measures included improving our ratio of tractors to non driver employees  reducing driver advertising  reducing driver lodging costs  restructuring discretionary driver pay programs  reducing truck sales location costs and decreasing the company matching contribution percentage for our k plan 
salaries  wages and benefits in the truckload segment decreased cent per mile on a total mile basis in compared to this decrease is primarily attributed to lower driver and non driver salaries  partially offset by higher group health insurance costs 
also offsetting these cost reductions was the effect of the lower average miles per tractor on the non driver  student and fringe benefit components of this expense category  as well as the shift from rent and purchased transportation expense to salaries  wages and benefits because of the decrease in independent contractor miles as a percentage of total miles 
although we improved our tractor to non driver ratio for the trucking operation by during  the benefit did not start to be realized until the second quarter of driver salaries decreased as progressed and following changes to some discretionary driver pay programs  resulted in lower expense per mile in the last half of higher group health insurance costs  resulting from an approximate increase in average claims costs per participant  were partially offset by lower workers compensation expense 
non driver salaries  wages and benefits in the non trucking vas segment were essentially flat 
although vas revenues were lower during  the number of shipments handled by vas in including those transferred to the truckload segment was approximately higher 
we renewed our workers compensation insurance coverage for the policy year that began april  our coverage levels were the same as the prior policy year 
we maintained a self insurance retention of million per claim 
our workers compensation insurance premiums for the policy year that began april were slightly lower than the previous policy year  due primarily to lower projected payroll 
the qualified and student driver recruiting and retention markets improved in compared to the weakness in the construction and automotive industries  other trucking company failures and fleet reductions and the higher national unemployment rate continued to improve driver recruiting and retention 
these factors resulted in limited employment options for drivers and consequently made more qualified and student drivers available in the workforce in fuel decreased cents per mile for the truckload segment due primarily to lower average diesel fuel prices and fuel efficiency improvements 
average diesel fuel prices in were per gallon lower than in  a decrease 
average monthly fuel prices in were lower than those in the comparable months of for the first ten months  only exceeding levels late in the year when prices rapidly declined 
during  we continued to improve fuel mpg through several initiatives to improve fuel efficiency 
we improved fuel mpg on a year over year basis for the eleventh consecutive quarter in fourth quarter these initiatives have been ongoing since march and include i reducing truck engine idle time  ii lowering non billable miles  iii increasing the percentage of aerodynamic  more fuel efficient trucks in the company truck fleet 
table of contents and iv installing apus in company trucks 
as of december   we had installed apus in approximately of the company owned truck fleet  compared to about as of december  as a result of these initiatives  we improved our company truck average mpg by in compared to this mpg improvement resulted in the purchase of million fewer gallons of diesel fuel in than in this equates to a reduction of approximately  tons of carbon dioxide emissions 
supplies and maintenance for the truckload segment decreased cents per total mile in compared to through our cost savings programs and improved driver retention  we realized decreases in driver related costs such as driver advertising and referral fees  motels and travel 
these savings were partially offset by a slight increase in the average age of our company truck fleet from years at december  to years at december   which contributes to higher maintenance costs  including maintenance that is not covered by warranty 
taxes and licenses for the truckload segment decreased cents per total mile in compared to due to a decrease in fuel taxes per mile resulting from the improvement in the company truck mpg 
this decrease was partially offset by the effect of lower average miles per tractor on the fixed cost components primarily equipment licensing fees of this operating expense category 
insurance and claims for the truckload segment decreased cent per total mile in compared to for small liability claims  in we experienced net favorable development on claims that occurred in prior years compared to net unfavorable development in  which was partially offset by slightly higher expense on a per mile basis related to claims incurred in the current year period 
for large liability claims  our expense for claims incurred in the current year period was essentially flat from to  and the amount we recorded for net unfavorable development on prior year claims was lower in than in we renewed our liability insurance policies on august  and continue to be responsible for the first million per claim with an annual million aggregate for claims between million and million 
the annual aggregate for claims in excess of million and less than million increased from million to million we maintain liability coverage with insurance carriers substantially in excess of the million per claim 
see item legal proceedings of this form k for information on our bodily injury and property damage coverage levels since august  our liability insurance premiums for the policy year that began august  were slightly lower than the previous policy year but increased about on a per mile basis 
depreciation expense for the truckload segment increased cents per total mile in compared to nearly half of the increase resulted from the effect of the lower average miles per tractor on this fixed cost 
the remainder of the increase was due to depreciation of the apus installed on more company trucks and a higher ratio of trailers to tractors resulting from the tractor fleet reductions 
while we incur depreciation expense on apus  we also incur lower fuel expense because tractors with apus consume much less fuel during periods of truck idling 
as a percentage of vas revenues  vas rent and purchased transportation expense decreased to in compared to in rent and purchased transportation for the truckload segment decreased cents per total mile in due primarily to i decreased fuel prices that resulted in lower reimbursements to independent contractors for fuel during most of compared to and ii the shift from rent and purchased transportation expense to salaries  wages and benefits expense because of the decrease in independent contractor truck miles as a percentage of total miles 
fuel reimbursements to independent contractors amounted to million in compared to million in other operating expenses for the truckload segment increased cents per mile in gains on sales of assets decreased to million in from million in buyer demand for used trucks and trailers was lower in due to the weak freight market and recessionary economy 
during the first half of  we closed eight lower volume fleet truck sales offices and continued to operate in eight locations across the continental united states 
other expense income we recorded interest income of million in compared to million in our average cash and cash equivalents balances were similar in both years  but the average interest rate earned on these funds was considerably lower in due to a decrease in market interest rates 
income taxes our effective income tax rate was for versus for the higher income tax rate can be attributed to higher state taxes 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources during the year ended december   we generated cash flow from operations of million  a increase million  compared to the year ended december  this increase is attributed primarily to i a million increase in cash flows related to insurance and claims accruals both current and long term due primarily to the settlement of some larger claims in  ii higher net income of million  iii an million increase in cash flows related to accounts payable and iv a million increase in cash flows related to accrued payroll 
these increases were partially offset by i a million decrease in cash flows related to increased accounts receivable due to shipment growth at the end of the year and higher fuel surcharge billings at the end of due to higher fuel prices in and ii higher income tax payments of million during cash flow from operations decreased million in from  or 
the decrease in cash flow from operations in compared to was attributed to i a million decrease in cash flows related to insurance and claims accruals both current and long term due primarily to the settlement of some larger claims  ii a million decrease in cash flows related to accounts receivable because of a decrease in fuel surcharge billings at the end of due to lower fuel prices and lower revenues attributed to the smaller fleet size in and iii a million decrease in cash flows related to accrued payroll 
we were able to make net capital expenditures  pay dividends and repurchase common stock because of the cash flow from operations and existing cash balances  supplemented by net borrowings under our existing credit facilities 
net cash used in investing activities increased by million to million in from million in and decreased by million in from net property additions primarily revenue equipment were million for the year ended december  compared to million during the same period of and million during the increase in investing cash flows from to and the decrease from to occurred because we took delivery of substantially fewer new trailers in than in and as of december   we were committed to property and equipment purchases  net of trades  of approximately million 
we currently expect our estimated net capital expenditures primarily revenue equipment to be in the range of million to million in we intend to fund these net capital expenditures through cash flow from operations and financing available under our existing credit facilities  as management deems necessary 
net financing activities used million in  million in and million in the decrease from to resulted from debt repayments net of borrowings of million in we had net borrowings of million in we paid quarterly and special dividends of million in  million in and million in the dividends paid in each of these years included special dividends of per share million total paid in december  per share million total paid in december and per share million total paid in december financing activities also included common stock repurchases of million in  and no such repurchases occurred in or from time to time  the company has repurchased  and may continue to repurchase  shares of the company s common stock 
the timing and amount of such purchases depends on stock market conditions and other factors 
as of december   the company had purchased  shares pursuant to our current board of directors repurchase authorization and had  shares remaining available for repurchase 
management believes our financial position at december  is strong 
as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and million of stockholders equity 
cash is invested primarily in government portfolio money market funds 
we do not hold any investments in auction rate securities 
as of december   we had million of available credit pursuant to two credit facilities  of which we had no borrowings outstanding 
the million of credit available under these facilities is reduced by the million in letters of credit under which we are obligated 
these letters of credit are primarily required as security for insurance policies 
based on our strong financial position  management does not foresee any significant barriers to obtaining sufficient financing  if necessary 

table of contents contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table sets forth our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  payments due by period in millions total less than year years years more than years period unknown contractual obligations unrecognized tax benefits property and equipment purchase commitments total contractual cash obligations other commercial commitments unused lines of credit standby letters of credit total commercial commitments total obligations we have committed credit facilities with two banks totaling million that mature in november million and may million 
borrowings under these credit facilities bear variable interest based on the london interbank offered rate libor 
as of december   we had no borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities with banks 
in january  we borrowed million  which we repaid in february the credit available under these facilities is reduced by the amount of standby letters of credit under which we are obligated 
the standby letters of credit are primarily required for insurance policies 
the unused lines of credit are available to us in the event we need financing for the replacement of our fleet or for other significant capital expenditures 
management believes our financial position is strong  and we therefore expect that we could obtain additional financing  if necessary 
property and equipment purchase commitments relate to committed equipment expenditures  net of trades  primarily for revenue equipment 
as of december   we have recorded a million liability for unrecognized tax benefits 
we expect million to be settled within the next twelve months and are unable to reasonably determine when the million categorized as period unknown will be settled 
off balance sheet arrangements in  we did not have any non cancelable revenue equipment operating leases or other arrangements that meet the definition of an off balance sheet arrangement 
critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the i reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and ii reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the most significant accounting policies and estimates that affect our financial statements include the following selections of estimated useful lives and salvage values for purposes of depreciating tractors and trailers 
depreciable lives of tractors and trailers range from months to years 
during  we changed the estimated useful lives and salvage values used for depreciating our tractors to reflect an extended replacement cycle 
previously  we generally depreciated tractors over an estimated useful life of months  using an estimated salvage value equal to of the cost 
beginning in second quarter  we extended the estimated useful life to months and reduced the estimated salvage value to this change did not affect the monthly depreciation rate and thus had no effect on depreciation expense recorded during the year  but allows depreciation expense to continue beyond months in recognition of the extended replacement cycle for tractors 
estimates of salvage value at the expected 
table of contents date of trade in or sale are based on the expected market values of equipment at the time of disposal 
we continually monitor the adequacy of the lives and salvage values used in calculating depreciation expense and adjust these assumptions appropriately when warranted 
impairment of long lived assets 
we review our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of a long lived asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss would be recognized if the carrying amount of the long lived asset is not recoverable and the carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
for long lived assets classified as held and used  the carrying amount is not recoverable when the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds the sum of the future net cash flows 
we do not separately identify assets by operating segment because tractors and trailers are routinely transferred from one operating fleet to another 
as a result  none of our long lived assets have identifiable cash flows from use that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
thus  the asset group used to assess impairment would include all of our assets 
estimates of accrued liabilities for insurance and claims for liability and physical damage losses and workers compensation 
the insurance and claims accruals current and non current are recorded at the estimated ultimate payment amounts and are based upon individual case estimates including negative development and estimates of incurred but not reported losses using loss development factors based upon past experience 
an actuary reviews our self insurance reserves for bodily injury and property damage claims and workers compensation claims every six months 
policies for revenue recognition 
operating revenues including fuel surcharge revenues and related direct costs are recorded when the shipment is delivered 
for shipments where a third party capacity provider including independent contractors under contract with us is utilized to provide some or all of the service and we i are the primary obligor in regard to the shipment delivery  ii establish customer pricing separately from carrier rate negotiations  iii generally have discretion in carrier selection and or iv have credit risk on the shipment  we record both revenues for the dollar value of services we bill to the customer and rent and purchased transportation expense for transportation costs we pay to the third party provider upon the shipment s delivery 
in the absence of the conditions listed above  we record revenues net of those expenses related to third party providers 
accounting for income taxes 
significant management judgment is required to determine i the provision for income taxes  ii whether deferred income taxes will be realized in full or in part and iii the liability for unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income in the years when those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
when it is more likely that all or some portion of specific deferred income tax assets will not be realized  a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of deferred income tax assets that are determined not to be realizable 
a valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets has not been deemed necessary due to our profitable operations 
accordingly  if facts or financial circumstances change and consequently impact the likelihood of realizing the deferred income tax assets  we would need to apply management s judgment to determine the amount of valuation allowance required in any given period 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is our estimate of the amount of probable credit losses and revenue adjustments in our existing accounts receivable 
we review the financial condition of customers for granting credit and monitor changes in customers financial conditions on an ongoing basis 
we determine the allowance based on analysis of individual customers financial condition  our historical write off experience and national economic conditions 
we have formal policies in place to continually monitor credit extended to customers and to manage our credit risk 
we maintain credit insurance for some customer accounts 
we evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts quarterly and believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate based on information currently available 
management periodically re evaluates these estimates as events and circumstances change 
together with the effects of the matters discussed above  these factors may significantly impact our results of operations from period to period 
inflation inflation may impact our operating costs 
a prolonged inflation period could cause rises in interest rates  fuel  wages and other costs 
these inflationary increases could adversely affect our results of operations unless freight rates could be increased correspondingly 
however  the effect of inflation has been minimal over the past three years 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 

table of contents interest rate risk we had no debt outstanding at december  interest rates on our unused credit facilities are based on the libor 
increases in interest rates could impact our annual interest expense on future borrowings 
as of december   we do not have any derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to interest rate increases 
commodity price risk the price and availability of diesel fuel are subject to fluctuations attributed to changes in the level of global oil production  refining capacity  seasonality  weather and other market factors 
historically  we have recovered a majority  but not all  of fuel price increases from customers in the form of fuel surcharges 
we implemented customer fuel surcharge programs with most of our customers to offset much of the higher fuel cost per gallon 
however  we do not recover all of the fuel cost increase through these surcharge programs 
we cannot predict the extent to which fuel prices will increase or decrease in the future or the extent to which fuel surcharges could be collected 
as of december   we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we conduct business in several foreign countries  including mexico  canada  china and australia 
to date  most foreign revenues are denominated in us dollars  and we receive payment for foreign freight services primarily in us dollars to reduce direct foreign currency risk 
assets and liabilities maintained by a foreign subsidiary company in the local currency are subject to foreign exchange gains or losses 
foreign currency translation gains and losses primarily relate to changes in the value of revenue equipment owned by a subsidiary in mexico  whose functional currency is the peso 
foreign currency translation gains were million in and million for and losses were million for and were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheets 
the exchange rate between the mexican peso and the us dollar was pesos to at december  compared to pesos to at december  and pesos to at december
