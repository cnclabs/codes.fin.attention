background and overview we are an education services holding company that owns strayer university 
strayer university is an institution of higher education which offers undergraduate and graduate degree programs at campuses including three new campuses opened for the winter term and two new campuses opened for the spring term in alabama  arkansas  delaware  florida  georgia  indiana  kentucky  louisiana  maryland  mississippi  new jersey  north carolina  ohio  pennsylvania  south carolina  tennessee  texas  utah  virginia  west virginia  wisconsin  and washington  dc  and worldwide via the internet 
we plan to open a total of eight new campuses in  including the five that have already been opened 
as set forth below  average enrollment  full time tuition rates  revenues  income from operations  net income  and diluted net income per share have all increased in each of the last three years 
year ended december  average enrollment change from prior year full time tuition per course change from prior year revenues in thousands change from prior year income from operations in thousands change from prior year net income in thousands change from prior year diluted net income per share change from prior year strayer university derives approximately of its revenue from tuition collected from its students 
the academic year of the university is divided into four quarters  which approximately coincide with the four quarters of the calendar year 
students make payment arrangements for the tuition for each course prior to the beginning of the quarter 
when students register for courses  tuition is recorded as unearned tuition  and is recognized in the quarter of instruction 
if a student withdraws from a course prior to completion  the university refunds a portion of the tuition depending on when the withdrawal occurs 
tuition revenue is shown net of any refunds  withdrawals  corporate discounts  employee tuition discounts and scholarships 
the university also derives revenue from other sources such as textbook related income  application fees  commencement fees  placement test fees  withdrawal fees  loan administration fees  and other income  which are all recognized when earned 
at the time of registration  unearned tuition a liability is recorded for academic services to be provided and a tuition receivable is recorded for the portion of the tuition not paid up front in cash 
because the university s academic quarters coincide with the calendar quarters  tuition receivable at the end of any calendar quarter largely represents student tuition due for the following academic quarter 
based upon past experience and judgment  the university establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts with respect to accounts receivable not included in unearned tuition 
any uncollected account more than six months past due is charged against the allowance 
our bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues for the years ended december    and was  and  respectively 
strayer university s expenses consist of instruction and educational support expenses  marketing and admissions expenses  and general and administration expenses 
instruction and educational support expenses generally contain items of expense directly attributable to the educational activity of the university 
this expense category includes salaries and benefits of faculty and academic administrators 
instruction and educational support expenses also include costs of educational supplies and facilities  including rent for campus facilities  certain costs of establishing and maintaining computer laboratories and all other physical plant and occupancy costs  with the exception of costs attributable to the corporate offices 
marketing and admissions expenses include salaries and benefits of personnel engaged in admissions  retention  marketing and business development  as well as costs of advertising and production of marketing materials 
general and administration expenses include salaries and benefits of management and employees engaged in student services  accounting  human resources  compliance and other corporate functions  along with the occupancy costs attributable to such functions 
bad debt expense is also included as a general and administration expense 
investment and other income consists primarily of earnings and realized gains or losses on investments 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments related to its allowance for uncollectible accounts  income tax provisions  valuation of deferred tax assets  forfeiture rates for stock based compensation plans and accrued expenses 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments regarding the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes that the following critical accounting policies are its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
tuition revenue is deferred at the time of registration and is recognized as income  net of any refunds or withdrawals  in the respective quarter of instruction 
advance registrations for the next quarter are recorded as unearned tuition 
we record estimates for our allowance for uncollectible accounts for tuition receivable from students 
if the financial condition of our students were to deteriorate  resulting in impairment of their ability to make required payments for tuition payable to us  additional allowances may be required 
we record estimates for our accrued expenses and income tax liabilities 
we periodically review our assumed forfeiture rates for stock based awards and adjust them as necessary 
should actual results differ from our estimates  revisions to our accrued expenses  stock based compensation expense  and income tax liabilities may be required 
new campuses our goal is to serve the demand for post secondary adult education nationwide by opening new campuses every year 
a new campus typically requires up to million in upfront capital costs for leasehold improvements  furniture and fixtures  and computer equipment 
in the first year of operation  assuming a mid year opening  we expect to incur operating losses of approximately million including depreciation related to the upfront capital costs 
a new campus is typically expected to begin generating operating income on a quarterly basis in four to six quarters of operation  which is generally upon reaching an enrollment level of about students 
our new campus notional model assumes an increase of average enrollment by students per year until reaching a level of about  students 
given the potential internal rate of return achieved with each new campus opening new campuses is an important part of our strategy 
we believe we have sufficient capital resources from cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities  cash generated from operating activities and availability on our credit facility discussed below to continue to open new campuses for at least the next months 
we plan to open eight new campuses in including five already opened 
we opened new campuses in and in see new campuses opened table in item for information regarding the locations of these new campuses 
global online operations centers we have two global online operations centers to accommodate the demand among students who neither live nor work near a physical campus location 
one operations center is located in chantilly  virginia and the other is located in salt lake city  utah
