item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a discusses our results of operations and our financial condition 
md a should be read in conjunction with our items business  a risk factors  and properties and our consolidated financial statements in item below 
executive overview net income attributable to amerigas partners for fiscal was million compared with net income attributable to amerigas partners for fiscal of million 
the fiscal results reflect million of loss on extinguishments of debt while fiscal results reflect a million loss associated with the discontinuance of interest rate hedges 
average temperatures in our service territory during fiscal and fiscal were and warmer than normal  respectively 
during fiscal  temperatures in early fall were significantly warmer than normal and we experienced an early end to the heating season weather in our southern regions 
the effects of these weather patterns  customer conservation and the impact on the prior year s volumes of a strong crop drying season resulted in lower year over year retail volume sales 
total margin was slightly higher in fiscal as the effects on margin from the lower volumes sold were more than offset by slightly higher average retail unit margins and greater non propane margin 
operating results for fiscal also reflect higher operating and administrative expenses than in fiscal on october   amerigas partners announced that it had reached a definitive agreement to acquire the retail propane business of energy transfer partners  comprising the third largest retail propane distributor in the united states  for total consideration of approximately billion in cash and amerigas partners common units 
the acquisition of the retail propane business of energy transfer partners is subject to a number of conditions including approval under the hart scott rodino act 
amerigas partners expects to close this acquisition by march  for more information on this transaction  see subsequent event proposed acquisition of the propane operations of energy transfer partners below and note to consolidated financial statements 
looking ahead  our results in fiscal will be influenced by a number of factors including  among others  temperatures in our service territories during the peak heating season  the level and volatility of commodity prices for propane  the strength of the economic recovery and customer conservation 
the impact of the anticipated acquisition of the retail propane business of energy transfer partners acquisition on fiscal results will depend upon when the transaction closes given the size of the acquisition and the seasonality of the business

in view of the omission of interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization from ebitda  management also assesses the profitability of the business by comparing net income attributable to amerigas partners for the relevant years 
management also uses ebitda to assess the partnership s profitability because its parent  ugi corporation  uses the partnership s ebitda to assess the profitability of the partnership

fiscal data has been adjusted to correct a noaa error 
based upon heating degree day data  average temperatures in the partnership s service territories were warmer than normal during fiscal compared with weather that was approximately warmer than normal in fiscal retail propane gallons sold declined principally due to the effects of an early end to the heating season in our southern regions  customer conservation and the impact on our prior year volumes of a strong crop drying season partially offset by volumes acquired through acquisitions 
retail propane revenues increased million during fiscal reflecting higher average retail sales prices million partially offset by lower retail volumes sold million 
wholesale propane revenues increased million principally reflecting higher wholesale selling prices million partially offset by slightly lower wholesale volumes sold million 
average wholesale propane prices at mont belvieu  texas  a major supply location in the us  were approximately higher in fiscal compared with average wholesale propane prices during fiscal revenues from fee income and ancillary sales and services increased million in fiscal total cost of sales increased million  to  million  principally reflecting the higher fiscal wholesale propane product costs 
total margin was million higher in fiscal as higher non propane margin from fee income and certain ancillary sales and services was offset in part by lower retail propane total margin million 
the lower retail propane total margin reflects the effects of the lower retail volumes sold million partially offset by the effects of slightly higher average retail unit margins million 
the million decrease in ebitda during fiscal includes loss on the extinguishments of senior notes million and modestly higher operating and administrative expenses million 
the negative effects of these items on the change in ebitda were partially offset by the absence of a million loss recorded in fiscal resulting from the discontinuance of interest rate hedges  higher other income million  and the previously mentioned greater total margin million 
the higher operating and administrative expenses in fiscal principally include greater compensation and benefits expenses million and vehicle fuel expenses million partially offset by lower self insured liability and casualty expenses million

fiscal data has been adjusted to correct a noaa error 
based upon heating degree day data  average temperatures in our service territories were warmer than normal during fiscal compared with temperatures in the prior year that were warmer than normal 
fiscal retail gallons sold were lower reflecting  among other things  the lingering effects of the economic recession  customer conservation and customer attrition partially offset by volumes acquired through business acquisitions 
retail propane revenues increased million during fiscal reflecting an increase as a result of higher average retail sales prices million partially offset by lower retail volumes sold million 
wholesale propane revenues increased million principally reflecting higher year over year wholesale selling prices million and  to a lesser extent  higher wholesale volumes sold million 
average wholesale propane prices at mont belvieu  texas  were approximately higher during fiscal compared with average wholesale propane prices during fiscal the lower average wholesale propane prices in fiscal principally resulted from a precipitous decline in prices that occurred during the first quarter of fiscal other revenues decreased million in fiscal compared with fiscal total cost of sales increased million  to  million  principally reflecting the higher wholesale propane product costs 
total margin was million lower in fiscal primarily due to lower total retail margin million 
the lower total retail margin reflects the effects of the lower retail volumes sold million partially offset by the effects of slightly higher average retail unit margins million including higher unit margins in our amerigas cylinder exchange program 
the million decrease in ebitda during fiscal reflects the absence of a pre tax gain recorded in fiscal associated with the november sale of the partnership s california lpg storage facility million  the previously mentioned decline in fiscal total margin million  and a loss from the discontinuance of interest rate hedges million 
during the three months ended march   the partnership s management determined that it was likely that it would not issue million of long term debt during the summer of due to the partnership s strong cash flow and anticipated extension of all or a portion of its supplemental credit agreement 
as a result  the partnership discontinued cash flow hedge accounting treatment for interest rate protection agreements associated with this previously anticipated debt issuance and recorded a million loss which is reflected in other income  net on the fiscal consolidated statement of income 
these previously mentioned declines in ebitda were partially offset by a decrease in operating and administrative expenses million largely due to lower self insured liability and casualty expenses million and lower compensation and benefits expense million partially offset by an increase in a litigation accrual recorded during the fourth quarter of fiscal million 
operating income in fiscal decreased million reflecting the previously mentioned decrease in ebitda million and slightly higher depreciation and amortization expense associated with fixed assets acquired during the past year million

amerigas olp s short term borrowing needs are seasonal and are typically greatest during the fall and winter heating season months due to the need to fund higher levels of working capital 
in order to meet its short term cash needs  amerigas olp has a million unsecured credit agreement credit agreement which expires on october  concurrently with entering into the credit agreement on june   amerigas olp terminated its then existing million revolving credit agreement dated as of november   and its million credit agreement dated as of april  supplemental credit agreement

the average daily and peak bank loan borrowings outstanding under the credit agreements during fiscal were million and million  respectively 
at september   the partnership s available borrowing capacity under the credit agreement was million 
based on existing cash balances  cash expected to be generated from operations  and borrowings available under the credit agreement  the partnership s management believes that the partnership will be able to meet its anticipated contractual commitments and projected cash needs during fiscal except for cash needs related to the acquisition of the retail propane business of energy transfer partners  which will be financed separately see subsequent event below 
for a more detailed discussion of the partnership s credit facilities  see note to consolidated financial statements 
partnership distributions the partnership makes distributions to its partners approximately days after the end of each fiscal quarter in a total amount equal to its available cash as defined in the fourth amended and restated agreement of limited partnership the partnership agreement for such quarter 
available cash generally means cash on hand at the end of such quarter  plus all additional cash on hand as of the date of determination resulting from borrowings after the end of such quarter  less the amount of cash reserves established by the general partner in its reasonable discretion 
the general partner may establish reserves for the proper conduct of the partnership s business and for distributions during the next four quarters 
in addition  until march   certain of the partnership s debt agreements required that reserves be established for the payment of debt principal and interest 
distributions of available cash are made to limited partners and to the general partner giving effect to the interest of the general partner in distributions of available cash from amerigas olp to amerigas partners until available cash exceeds the minimum quarterly distribution of and the first target distribution of per common unit or a total of per common unit 
when available cash exceeds per common unit in any quarter  the general partner will receive a greater percentage of the total partnership distribution but only with respect to the amount by which the distribution per common unit to limited partners exceeds 

table of contents quarterly distributions of available cash per limited partner unit paid during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal were as follows fiscal st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  the partnership made quarterly distributions to common unitholders in excess of per limited partner unit 
as a result  the general partner has received a greater percentage of the total partnership distribution than its aggregate general partner interest in amerigas olp and amerigas partners 
the total amount of distributions received by the general partner with respect to its aggregate general partner ownership interests totaled million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal included in these amounts are incentive distributions received by the general partner during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal of million  million and million  respectively 
on july   the general partner s board of directors approved a distribution of per common unit payable on august  to unitholders of record on august  this distribution included the regular quarterly distribution of per common unit and per common unit reflecting a one time distribution of a portion of the proceeds from the partnership s sale of its california storage facility in november cash flows operating activities 
due to the seasonal nature of the partnership s business  cash flows from operating activities are generally strongest during the second and third fiscal quarters when customers pay for propane consumed during the heating season months 
conversely  operating cash flows are generally at their lowest levels during the first and fourth fiscal quarters when the partnership s investment in working capital  principally accounts receivable and inventories  is generally greatest 
the partnership may use its credit agreements to satisfy its seasonal operating cash flow needs 
cash flow from operating activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal cash flow from operating activities before changes in operating working capital was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal cash provided used to fund changes in operating working capital totaled million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal cash flow from changes in operating working capital primarily reflects the impact of changes in propane product costs on cash receipts from customers and cash paid for propane as reflected in changes in accounts receivable  inventories and accounts payable 
the higher cash needed to fund changes in working capital in fiscal and fiscal generally resulted from year over year increases in wholesale propane product prices 
the greater cash provided by changes in operating working capital in fiscal reflects a significant decline in wholesale propane product costs 
cash flow from changes in operating working capital in fiscal also reflects reimbursements of million of counterparty collateral deposits paid in fiscal 
table of contents investing activities 
investing activity cash flow is principally affected by expenditures for property  plant and equipment  cash paid for acquisitions of businesses and proceeds from sales of assets 
cash flow used in investing activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal we spent million for property  plant and equipment comprising million of maintenance capital expenditures and million of growth capital expenditures in fiscal  million for property  plant and equipment comprising million of maintenance capital expenditures and million of growth capital expenditures in fiscal  and million for property  plant and equipment comprising million of maintenance capital expenditures and million of growth capital expenditures in fiscal in november  the partnership sold its california  barrel lpg storage facility for net cash proceeds of million 
financing activities 
changes in cash flow from financing activities are primarily due to distributions on amerigas partners common units  issuances and repayments of long term debt  borrowings under credit agreements  and issuances of amerigas partners common units 
cash flow used by financing activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal as previously mentioned  during fiscal  amerigas partners redeemed million principal amount of its senior notes due and million principal amount of its senior notes due with proceeds from the issuance of million principal amount of senior notes due in addition  amerigas partners redeemed million principal amount of its senior notes due with proceeds from the issuance of million principal amount of senior notes due a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes were also used to reduce bank loan borrowings

during fiscal  amerigas olp repaid million of maturing first mortgage notes using bank loan borrowings and cash from operations 
during fiscal  amerigas olp repaid million of maturing first mortgage notes using cash generated from operations 

table of contents capital expenditures in the following table  we present capital expenditures which exclude acquisitions for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal we also provide amounts we expect to spend in fiscal we expect to finance fiscal capital expenditures principally from cash generated by operations and borrowings under our credit agreement 
year ended september  millions of dollars estimate property  plant and equipment contractual cash obligations and commitments the partnership has certain contractual cash obligations that extend beyond fiscal including scheduled repayments of long term debt  interest on long term fixed rate debt  lease obligations  capital expenditures and propane supply contracts 
the following table presents significant contractual cash obligations as of september  payments due by period fiscal fiscal fiscal and millions of dollars total fiscal thereafter long term debt a interest on long term fixed rate debt b operating leases propane supply contracts other purchase obligations c total a based upon stated maturity dates 
b based upon stated interest rates 
c includes material capital expenditure obligations 
the components of other noncurrent liabilities included in our consolidated balance sheet at september  principally consist of property and casualty liabilities and  to a much lesser extent  liabilities associated with executive compensation plans and employee post employment benefit programs 
these liabilities are not included in the table of contractual cash obligations and commitments because they are estimates of future payments and not contractually fixed as to timing or amount 
certain of our operating lease arrangements  primarily vehicle leases with remaining lease terms of one to ten years  have residual value guarantees 
although such fair values at the end of the leases have historically exceeded the guaranteed amount  at september  the maximum potential amount of future payments under lease guarantees  assuming the leased equipment was deemed worthless at the end of the lease term  was approximately million 
partnership sale of california storage facility on november   amerigas olp sold its  barrel refrigerated  above ground storage facility located on leased property in california 
we recorded a pre tax gain of million associated with this transaction  which increased net income attributable to amerigas partners for the year ended september  by million 

table of contents related party transactions pursuant to the partnership agreement  the general partner is entitled to reimbursement for all direct and indirect expenses incurred or payments it makes on behalf of the partnership 
prior to the october  merger of eagle olp with amerigas olp the merger and pursuant to a management services agreement between amerigas eagle holdings  inc  the general partner of eagle olp prior to the merger  and the general partner  the general partner was also entitled to reimbursement for all direct and indirect expenses it made on eagle olp s behalf 
these costs  which totaled million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal  include employee compensation and benefit expenses of employees of the general partner and general and administrative expenses 
ugi provides certain financial and administrative services to the general partner 
ugi bills the general partner monthly for all direct and indirect corporate expenses incurred in connection with providing these services and the general partner is reimbursed by the partnership for these expenses 
the allocation of indirect ugi corporate expenses to the partnership utilizes a weighted  three component formula based on the relative percentage of the partnership s revenues  operating expenses and net assets employed to the total of such items for all ugi operating subsidiaries for which general and administrative services are provided 
the general partner believes that this allocation method is reasonable and equitable to the partnership 
such corporate expenses totaled million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal in addition  ugi and certain of its subsidiaries provide office space  stop loss medical coverage and automobile liability insurance to the partnership 
the costs related to these items totaled million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal amerigas olp purchases propane from atlantic energy  inc atlantic energy  which  prior to july   was a subsidiary of ugi 
atlantic energy and amerigas olp are parties to a propane sales agreement product sales agreement 
the product sales agreement was amended to extend beyond the initial termination date of april  to april  and to provide for an option to extend beyond that date for an additional five years 
the price to be paid for product purchased under the agreement is determined annually using a contractual formula that takes into account published index prices and the locational value of deliveries at the terminal 
in addition  from time to time  amerigas olp purchases propane on an as needed basis from ugi energy services  inc energy services 
the price of the purchases are generally based on market price at the time of purchase 
purchases of propane by amerigas olp from energy services and atlantic energy through july  totaled million  million and million during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
on october   amerigas olp acquired all of the assets of penn fuel propane  llc now named ugi central penn propane  llc  cpp from cpp  a second tier subsidiary of ugi utilities  inc  for million cash plus estimated working capital of million 
ugi utilities  inc is a wholly owned subsidiary of ugi 
cpp sold propane to customers primarily in eastern pennsylvania 
amerigas olp funded the acquisition of the assets of cpp principally from credit agreement borrowings 
pursuant to the acquisition agreement  in february  amerigas olp reached an agreement with ugi utilities on the working capital adjustment pursuant to which ugi utilities reimbursed amerigas olp million plus interest 
in addition  the partnership sells propane to affiliates of ugi 
such amounts were not material in fiscal  fiscal or fiscal off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are expected to have an effect on the partnership s financial condition  change in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 

table of contents subsequent event proposed acquisition of the propane operations of energy transfer partners on october   amerigas partners announced that it had reached a definitive agreement to acquire the propane operations of energy transfer partners  lp energy transfer for total consideration of approximately billion  including billion in cash  amerigas partners common units valued at approximately billion at the time of the execution of the agreement  and the assumption of million in debt the acquisition 
energy transfer conducts its propane operations in states through its subsidiaries heritage operating  lp and titan energy partners  lp collectively  heritage propane 
according to lp gas magazine rankings  heritage propane is the third largest retail propane distributor in the united states  delivering over million gallons to more than one million retail propane customers 
the acquisition of heritage propane is subject to customary closing conditions  including approval under the hart scott rodino act 
amerigas partners obligation to complete the acquisition is also conditioned on it obtaining debt financing on certain agreed upon terms 
in addition to new debt financing  the partnership expects to increase the size of its credit agreement to at least million upon closing of the acquisition 
the agreement contains termination rights for both parties 
under certain conditions  termination by amerigas partners could result in the payment of a termination fee of up to million 
amerigas partners expects to complete the acquisition by march  market risk disclosures our primary financial market risks include commodity prices for propane and interest rates on borrowings 
although we use derivative financial and commodity instruments to reduce market price risk associated with forecasted transactions  we do not use derivative financial and commodity instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
commodity price risk the risk associated with fluctuations in the prices the partnership pays for propane is principally a result of market forces reflecting changes in supply and demand for propane and other energy commodities 
the partnership s profitability is sensitive to changes in propane supply costs and the partnership generally passes on increases in such costs to customers 
the partnership may not  however  always be able to pass through product cost increases fully or on a timely basis  particularly when product costs rise rapidly 
in order to reduce the volatility of the partnership s propane market price risk  we use contracts for the forward purchase or sale of propane  propane fixed price supply agreements  and over the counter derivative commodity instruments including price swap and option contracts 
over the counter derivative commodity instruments utilized by the partnership to hedge forecasted purchases of propane are generally settled at expiration of the contract 
these derivative financial instruments contain collateral provisions 
the fair value of unsettled commodity price risk sensitive instruments at september  and were losses gains of million and million  respectively 
a hypothetical adverse change in the market price of propane would result in a decrease in fair value of million and million  respectively 
because the partnership s propane derivative instruments generally qualify as hedges under gaap  we expect that changes in the fair value of derivative instruments used to manage propane market price risk would be substantially offset by gains or losses on the associated anticipated transactions 
interest rate risk the partnership has both fixed rate and variable rate debt 
changes in interest rates impact the cash flows of variable rate debt but generally do not impact their fair value 
conversely  changes in interest rates impact the fair value of fixed rate debt but do not impact their cash flows 
our variable rate debt includes borrowings under the credit agreement 
this agreement has interest rates that are generally indexed to short term market interest rates 
at september   there were million of borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement 
based upon the average level of borrowings outstanding under the credit agreements in fiscal  an increase in short term interest rates of basis points would have increased annual interest expense by million 
the remainder of our debt outstanding is subject to fixed rates of interest 
a basis point increase in market interest rates would result in decreases in the fair value of this fixed rate debt of million and million at september  and  respectively 
a basis point decrease in market interest rates would result in increases in the fair market value of this debt of million and million at september  and  respectively 

table of contents our long term debt is typically issued at fixed rates of interest based upon market rates for debt having similar terms and credit ratings 
as these long term debt issues mature  we may refinance such debt with new debt having interest rates reflecting then current market conditions 
this debt may have an interest rate that is more or less than the refinanced debt 
in order to reduce interest rate risk associated with forecasted issuances of fixed rate debt  from time to time we may enter into interest rate protection agreements 
there were no settled or unsettled amounts relating to interest rate protection agreements at september  or as previously mentioned  during the three months ended march   the partnership s management determined that it was likely that it would not issue million of long term debt during the summer of due to the partnership s strong cash flow and anticipated extension of all or a portion of the supplemental credit agreement 
as a result  the partnership discontinued cash flow hedge accounting treatment for interest rate protection agreements associated with this previously anticipated million long term debt issuance and recorded a million loss which is reflected in other income  net  on the fiscal consolidated statements of operations 
derivative financial instruments credit risk the partnership is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to derivative financial and commodity instruments 
our counterparties principally consist of major energy companies and major us financial institutions 
we maintain credit policies with regard to our counterparties that we believe reduce overall credit risk 
these policies include evaluating and monitoring our counterparties financial condition  including their credit ratings  and entering into agreements with counterparties that govern credit limits 
certain of these agreements call for the posting of collateral by the counterparty or by the partnership in the form of letters of credit  parental guarantees or cash 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with gaap requires the selection and application of appropriate accounting principles to the relevant facts and circumstances of the partnership s operations and the use of estimates made by management 
the partnership has identified the following critical accounting policies that are most important to the portrayal of the partnership s financial condition and results of operations 
changes in these policies could have a material effect on the financial statements 
the application of these accounting policies necessarily requires management s most subjective or complex judgments regarding estimates and projected outcomes of future events which could have a material impact on the financial statements 
management has reviewed these critical accounting policies  and the estimates and assumptions associated with them  with its audit committee 
in addition  management has reviewed the following disclosures regarding the application of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee 
litigation accruals and environmental liabilities 
the partnership is involved in litigation regarding pending claims and legal actions that arise in the normal course of its business and may own sites at which hazardous substances may be present 
in accordance with gaap  the partnership establishes reserves for pending claims and legal actions or environmental remediation liabilities when it is probable that a liability exists and the amount or range of amounts can be reasonably estimated 
reasonable estimates involve management judgments based on a broad range of information and prior experience 
these judgments are reviewed quarterly as more information is received and the amounts reserved are updated as necessary 
such estimated reserves may differ materially from the actual liability and such reserves may change materially as more information becomes available and estimated reserves are adjusted 

table of contents depreciation and amortization of long lived assets 
we compute depreciation on property  plant and equipment on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives generally ranging from to years 
we also use amortization methods and determine asset values of intangible assets other than goodwill using reasonable assumptions and projections 
changes in the estimated useful lives of property  plant and equipment and changes in intangible asset amortization methods or values could have a material effect on our results of operations 
as of september   our net property  plant and equipment totaled million and we recorded depreciation expense of million during fiscal as of september   our net intangible assets other than goodwill totaled million and we recorded amortization expense on intangible assets of million during fiscal purchase price allocation 
from time to time  we enter into material business combinations 
in accordance with accounting guidance associated with business combinations  the purchase price is allocated to the various assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair value 
fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based upon available information and may involve us engaging an independent third party to perform an appraisal 
estimating fair values can be complex and subject to significant business judgment 
estimates most commonly impact property  plant and equipment and intangible assets  including those with indefinite lives 
generally  we have  if necessary  up to one year from the acquisition date to finalize the purchase price allocation
