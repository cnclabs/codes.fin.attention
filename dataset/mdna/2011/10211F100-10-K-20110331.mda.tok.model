executive level overview we are a medical device company engaged in the manufacturing and marketing of electrosurgical devices 
our medical products include a wide range of devices including electrosurgical generators and accessories  cauteries  medical lighting  nerve locators and other products 
we internally divide our operations into three product lines 
electrosurgical products  battery operated cauteries and other products 
the electrosurgical line sells electrosurgical products which include desiccators  generators  electrodes  electrosurgical pencils and various ancillary disposable products 
these products are used in surgery for the cutting and coagulation of tissue 
battery operated cauteries are used for precise hemostasis to stop bleeding in ophthalmology and in other fields 
our other revenues are derived from nerve locators  disposable and reusable penlights  medical lighting  license fees  development fees and other miscellaneous income 
most of the company s products currently are marketed through medical distributors  which distribute to more than  hospitals  and to doctors and other health care facilities 
new distributors are contacted through responses to our advertising in international and domestic medical journals and domestic or international trade shows 
international sales represented of total revenues in as compared with in and in the company s products are sold in more than countries through local dealers which are coordinated by sales and marketing personnel at the clearwater  florida facility 
as mentioned previously for the launch of our new surgical suite product lines  we have established the use of a network of approximately commission based independent direct sales contractors to m arket these products 
our business is generally not seasonal in nature 
outlook for the company continues to place great effort and resources into the development of j plasma recently submitting to the fda a new handpiece with retractable cutting features used in both laparoscopic and open procedures 
since the outset of the current fiscal year  surgeons operating in diverse specialties have been engaged in evaluating j plasma and the feedback received is most encouraging 
increased emphasis has been placed on sales and marketing with the hiring of new personnel and the engagement of over independent sales representatives 
we have been pleased with the sales of bovie s resistick ii coated blades and the initial orders of our laparoscopic instruments through this network 
finally  accelerated progress has been achieved in the development of our vessel sealing instrument line since moving its operations from canada to our headquarters in clearwater  fl 
we anticipate resubmitting a k application in the second half of there is much uncertainty in today s economic climate  however  we have made every effort to base our outlook and business strategy on a conservative approach and one based on knowledge and experience 

table of contents in today s economic environment  marked by historic uncertainty  forecasting has become increasingly more difficult 
we have and will always  take a conservative approach 
every effort has been made to provide an outlook based on our experience and knowledge  however  variations beyond our ability to predict or control often impact forecasting which may result in a change in this outlook

scheduled maturities of this indebtedness are     and  for    and  respectively 
we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents at december  we believe our cash on hand  as well as anticipated cash flows from operations  will be sufficient to meet our operating cash commitments for the next year 
should additional funds be required  we have secured additional borrowing capacity with rbc bank usa 
see below 
table of contents we have an million secured revolving line of credit facility with rbc bank usa  which at december  had a zero balance 
advances under the million line of credit are due on demand and bear interest at a rate of libor plus with a minimum floor rate of and are secured by a perfected first security interest in our inventory and accounts receivable 
in addition we have a separate additional credit facility with rbc bank usa for up to million specific to financing new equipment purchases 
this credit facility provides for a year draw up period followed by a year term period and bears interest also at libor plus with a minimum floor of and is secured by a perfected first security interest in the new equipment purchased

our future contractual obligations for agreements with initial terms greater than one year and agreements to purchase materials in the normal course of business are summarized as follows in thousands description years ending december  operating leases employment agreements purchase commitments critical accounting estimates in preparing the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap  we have adopted various accounting policies 
our most significant accounting policies are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
our estimates and assumptions  including those related to inventories  intangible assets  property  plant and equipment  legal proceedings  research and development  warranty obligations  product liability  fair valued liabilities  sales returns and discounts  and income taxes are updated as appropriate  which in most cases is at least quarterly 
we base our estimates on historical experience  or various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and the results form the basis for making judgments about the reported values of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
actual result s may materially differ from these estimates 
estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria the estimate requires assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made  and other materially different estimates could have been reasonably made or material changes in the estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
our critical accounting estimates include the following 
table of contents inventory reserves when necessary we maintain reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell our products at prices in excess of current carrying costs 
the markets in which we operate are highly competitive  with new products and surgical procedures introduced on an ongoing basis 
such marketplace changes may cause our products to become obsolete 
we make estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventories based on historical experience  and expected future trends 
if actual product life cycles  product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required  which would unfavorably affect future operating results 
long lived assets we review long lived assets which are held and used  including property and equipment and intangible assets  for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
such evaluations compare the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset over its expected useful life and are significantly impacted by estimates of future prices and volumes for our products  capital needs  economic trends and other factors that are inherently difficult to forecast 
if the asset is considered to be impaired  we record an impairment charge equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value determined by either a quoted market price  if any  or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow tec hnique 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements liabilities valued at fair value we generally do not use derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow risks or market risks 
however  certain financial instruments  such as warrants  which are indexed to our common stock  are classified as liabilities when either a the holder possesses rights to net cash settlement or b physical or net share settlement is not within our control 
in such instances  net cash settlement is assumed for financial accounting and reporting purposes  even when the terms of the underlying contracts do not provide for net cash settlement 
such financial instruments are initially recorded  and continuously carried  at fair value 
determining the fair value of these instruments involves judgment and the use of certain relevant assumptions including  but not limited to  interest rate risk  historical volatility and stock price  estimated life of the derivative  antidilution provisions  and conversion redemption privileges 
the use of different assumptions or changes in those assumptions could have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts 
share based compensation under our stock option plan  options to purchase common shares of the company may be granted to key employees  officers and directors of the company by the board of directors 
the company accounts for stock options in accordance with sfas statement r with option expense amortized over the vesting period based on the binomial lattice option pricing model fair value on the grant date  which includes a number of estimates that affect the amount of our expense 
income taxes the provision for income taxes includes federal  foreign  state and local income taxes currently payable and those deferred because of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets or liabilities are computed based on the difference between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted marginal tax rates 
valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized 
deferred income tax expenses or credits are based on the changes in the asset or liability from period to period 

table of contents we have net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards available in certain jurisdictions to reduce future taxable income 
future tax benefits for net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards are recognized to the extent that realization of these benefits is considered more likely than not 
this determination is based on the expectation that related operations will be sufficiently profitable or various tax  business and other planning strategies will enable us to utilize the operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
we cannot be assured that we will be able to realize these future tax benefits or that future valuation allowances will not be required 
to the extent that available evidence raises doubt about the realization of a deferred income tax asset  a valuation allowance is established 
it is our policy to provide for uncertain tax positions and the related interest and penalties based upon management s assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities 
to the extent that the probable tax outcome of these uncertain tax positions changes  such changes in estimate will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determination is made 
at december   we believe we have appropriately accounted for any unrecognized tax benefits 
to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability for an unrecognized tax benefit is established or we are required to pay amounts in excess of the liability  our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be affected 
since inception  we have been subject to tax by both federal and state taxing authorities 
until the respective statutes of limitations expire which maybe as much as years while we have unused nol s  we are subject to income tax audits in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
inflation inflation has not materially impacted the operations of our company 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements at this time 
recent accounting pronouncements see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our short term investments consist of cash  cash equivalents and overnight investments 
as such we do not believe we are exposed to significant interest rate risk 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in highly liquid overnight money market investments 
if a change in interest rates were to have occurred on december   this change would not have had a material effect on the fair value of our investment portfolio as of that date
