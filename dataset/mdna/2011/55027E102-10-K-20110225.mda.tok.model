this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
overview we develop  manufacture and sell proprietary biological testing technologies and products with applications throughout the life sciences and diagnostics industries 
these industries depend on a broad range of tests  called bioassays  to perform diagnostic tests and conduct life science research 
our xmap technology  an open architecture  multiplexing technology  allows simultaneous analysis of up to bioassays from a small sample volume  typically a single drop of fluid  by reading biological tests on the surface of microscopic polystyrene beads called microspheres 
xmap technology combines this miniaturized liquid array bioassay capability with small lasers  digital signal processors and proprietary software to create a system offering advantages in speed  precision  flexibility and cost 
our xmap technology is currently being used within various segments of the life sciences industry which includes the fields of drug discovery and development  and for clinical diagnostics  genetic analysis  bio defense  food safety and biomedical research 
our end user customers and partners  which include laboratory professionals performing research  clinical laboratories performing tests on patients as ordered by a physician and other laboratories  have a fundamental need to perform high quality testing as efficiently as possible 
luminex has adopted a business model built  in part  around strategic partnerships 
we have licensed our xmap technology to partner companies  which in turn then develop products that incorporate the xmap technology into products that our partners sell to end users 
we develop and manufacture the proprietary xmap laboratory instrumentation and the proprietary xmap microspheres and sell these products to our partners 
our partners then sell xmap instrumentation and xmap based reagent consumable products  which run on the instrumentation  to the end user laboratory 
as of december   luminex had approximately strategic partners and these partners have purchased from luminex approximately  xmap based multiplexing analyzer systems 
of the strategic partners  have released commercialized reagent based products utilizing our technology 
luminex has several forms of revenue that result from our business model system revenue is generated from the sale of our xmap multiplexing analyzers and peripherals and dry sample preparation laboratory instruments 
consumable revenue is generated from the sale of our dyed polystyrene microspheres and sheath fluid 
our larger commercial and development partners often purchase these consumables in bulk to minimize the number of incoming qualification events and to allow for longer development and production runs 
royalty revenue is generated when a partner sells our proprietary microspheres to an end user  a partner sells a kit incorporating our proprietary microspheres to an end user or when a partner utilizes a kit to provide a testing result to a user 
end users can be facilities such as testing labs  development facilities and research facilities that buy prepared kits and have specific testing needs or testing service companies that provide assay results to pharmaceutical research companies or physicians 
assay revenue is generated from the sale of our kits which are a combination of chemical and biological reagents and our proprietary xmap bead technology used to perform diagnostic and research assays on samples 
service revenue is generated when a partner or other owner of a system purchases a service contract from us after the standard warranty has expired or pays us for our time and materials to service instruments 
service contract revenue is amortized over the life of the contract and the costs associated with those contracts are recognized as incurred 
other revenue consists of items such as training  shipping  parts sales  license revenue  grant revenue  contract research and development fees  milestone revenue and other items that individually amount to less than of total revenue 

table of contents highlights luminex grew total revenue over revenue to million gross margin percentage of  compared to in consumable sales increased and royalty revenue increased over the prior calendar year global launch of magpix  an analytical instrument that is capable of performing up to tests on a single sample and providing nearly  data points in under an hour long term renewal of our year strategic partnership with one lambda  inc  one of our top partners and the leader in the hla typing and antibody screening market system shipments of multiplexing analyzers  resulting in cumulative life to date multiplexing analyzer shipments of  up from a year ago partners reported approximately million of royalty bearing end user sales on xmap technology for the year  a increase over launched the xtag cystic fibrosis kit v  a new fda cleared diagnostic test that can simultaneously screen a single blood sample for up to cystic fibrosis causing genetic mutations in a matter of hours acquisition in may of bsd robotics  an australian based private company with advanced robotics technology for newborn screening and forensics teaming agreement with northrop grumman corporation to collaborate in the creation of next generation bio detectors launched our first pharmacogenetic test  the xtag cypd kit  which recently received k clearance from the us food and drug administration fda 
the new test enables a personalized medicine approach to help physicians manage patients for whom they may prescribe certain drugs that are metabolized by the enzyme cytochrome p d authorized a share repurchase of up to  shares  but not more than million in aggregate purchase price  of luminex s common stock through november consumables sales trends we have experienced significant fluctuations in consumable revenue over the past two years 
overall  the fluctuations manifested themselves through periodic changes in volume from our largest bulk purchasing partners 
from the third quarter of through the fourth quarter of  we had quarterly bulk purchases varying from million to million 
even though we experience variability in consumable revenue  the trend of our long term average of consumable sales  one of our key indicators of performance  suggests a continued growth pattern 
another indicator of the success of our partners commercialization efforts is the rising level of royalties and reported royalty bearing sales during the past several years 
release of valuation allowance during the fourth quarter of  we released a portion of our total valuation allowance on deferred us tax assets based upon an assessment which indicated that luminex was more likely than not to benefit from the deferred tax assets based upon our historical pre tax book income and projected taxable income 
as a result of the release of our valuation allowance on us tax assets  our effective tax rate  which has been relatively low  will be higher than our blended corporate rate 
for  we estimate that our effective tax rate will be in excess of the maximum us corporate tax rate of  however  for the full year  we expect cash taxes paid will be less than of total income tax expense recognized for the full year 
the quarterly effective tax rate for will fluctuate as a result of variability o f the taxable income within the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate the united states  canada  the netherlands  china  japan and australia 

table of contents change in cash position our cash  cash equivalents and investments increased by approximately million for the year ended december  to million from million at december  the increase was primarily attributable to positive operating cash flows offset by capital expenditures of million  and strategic investments  including the acquisition of bsd for million  totaling million 
segment information luminex has two reportable segments the technology and strategic partnerships tsp segment and the assays and related products arp segment 
the tsp segment  which is our base business  consists of system sales to partners and end customers  raw bead sales  royalties  service and support of the technology  and other miscellaneous items 
the arp segment is primarily involved in the development and sale of assays on xmap technology for use on luminex s installed base of systems 
future operations we expect our primary challenges over the next twelve months to be the continued adoption and development of partner products incorporating luminex technology  the effect of the ongoing uncertainty in global finance markets and changes in government funding on planned purchases by end users  commercialization  regulatory acceptance and market adoption of output from the arp segment  and the expansion and enhancement of our installed base and position within our identified target market segments 
we anticipate continued revenue concentration in our higher margin items assays  consumables and royalties contributing to favorable  but variable  gross margin percentages 
additionally  we believe that a sustained investment in research and development is necessary in order to meet the needs of our marketplace and provide a sustainable new product pipeline 
we may experience volatility in research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue on a quarterly basis 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the following is a discussion of our most critical accounting policies use d in the preparation of our financial statements  and the judgments and estimates involved under each 
we also have other significant accounting policies that do not involve critical accounting estimates because they do not generally require us to make estimates and judgments that are difficult or subjective 
these are described in note of our consolidated financial statements provided herein in item estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents revenue recognition 
revenue on sales of our products is recognized when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed and determinable and collectability is probable 
these criteria are generally met at the time our product is shipped 
if the criteria for revenue recognition are not met at the time of shipment  the revenue is deferred until all criteria are met 
royalty revenue is generated when a partner sells products incorporating our technology  provides testing services to third parties using our technology or resells our consumables 
royalty revenue is recognized as it is reported to us by our partners  generally quarterly  therefore  the underlying end user sales may be related to prior periods due to the timing of when the revenue is reported to us by our partners 
we also sell extended service contracts for maintenance and support of our products 
revenue for service contracts is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
revenue from contracts with multiple elements is recognized as each element is earned based on the relative selling price of each element when there are no undelivered elements that are essential to the functionality of the delivered elements and when the amount is not contingent upon delivery of the undelivered elements 
upfront payments from our strategic partners are nonrefundable and will be recognized as revenue as our strategic partners purchase products or applied against royalty payments 
nonrefundable license fees are amortized into revenue over the estimated life of the license agreements 
inventory valuation 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value  with cost determined according to the standard cost method 
inventories have been written down through an allowance for excess and obsolete inventories 
the two major components of the allowance for excess and obsolete inventory are i a specific write down for inventory items that we no longer use in the manufacture of our products or that no longer meet our specifications and ii a write down against slow moving items for potential obsolescence 
inventory is reviewed on a regular basis and adjusted based on management s review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales 
while management believes that adequate write downs for invent ory obsolescence have been made in the consolidated financial statements  scientific and technological advances will continue and we could experience additional inventory write downs in the future 
however  we do not believe this estimate is subject to significant variability 
warranties 
we provide for the estimated cost of initial product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
while management believes that adequate reserve has been made in the consolidated financial statements for product warranties  should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
however  we do not believe this estimate is subject to significant variability 
purchase price allocation  intangibles and goodwill 
the purchase price allocation for acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired  including in process research and development ipr d  and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values 
intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over the assets estimated useful lives using the straight line method 
we periodically review the estimated useful lives of our identifiable intangible assets  taking into consideration any events or circumstances that might result in a dimin ished fair value or revised useful life 
we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets annually or more frequently if there is evidence that certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
in performing the impairment test  we utilize the two step approach prescribed under us gaap 
the first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting unit to the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
if in step one of the annual test  the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then a goodwill impairment test is performed in step two to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
we would recognize an impairment charge for any amount by wh ich the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value 
determining the fair value of goodwill is subjective in nature and often involves the use of estimates and assumptions 
as of december   we have million of goodwill allocated to the arp segment 
our annual test did not result in an impairment charge as the estimated fair value of the arp segment reporting unit continues to exceed the carrying value by a significant enough amount that any reasonably likely change in the assumptions used in the analysis  including terminal growth rates and the discount rate  would not cause the carrying value to exceed the estimated fair value for the reporting unit as determined under step one of the goodwill impairment analysis 

table of contents we utilize the income approach based on a discounted cash flow analysis to determine fair value estimates  and then use market comparisons as a reasonability check to ensure that neither the income approach nor the market comparisons yielded significantly different results 
the income approach is based on a discounted cash flow dcf analysis and calculates the fair value by estimating the after tax cash flows attributable to a reporting unit and then discounting the after tax cash flows to a present value using a risk adjusted discount rate 
as our arp segment and goodwill came into existence in due to our acquisition of tm biosciences  now referred to as lmd  and through our subsequent acquisition of bsd on may   we believe that the dcf method best aligns with how we approached the acquisitions and determined the value of the acquired companies 
this methodology used to determine fair value has been consistently applied since the inception of our goodwill in  however  the assumptions and estimates are updated each year 
our estimates are based on revenue projections by product line  and include judgment based on historical growth and scheduled product approvals by the various governmental authorities 
we believe its assumptions are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the underlying businesses 
the most significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flow methodology are the discount rate  based upon the estimated weighted average cost of capital wacc  and the terminal growth rate  based upon strategic studies we commissioned and our own internal analysis 
we used the following rates in assumptions wacc terminal growth rate to determine our wacc rate  we performed a peer company analysis and considered the weighted average return on debt and equity  the updated risk free interest rate  beta  equity risk premium  and entity specific size risk premium 
we based our terminal growth rates upon market estimates provided in strategic studies previously commissioned by us and our own internal analysis 
our analysis yielded an estimated fair value in excess of the carrying value by over for concurrent with the above analysis  we performed a sensitivity analysis based upon reasonably likely changes to determine if our dcf analysis would result in impairment if the following changes were made to our assumptions i assumed wacc rate was increased by percentage points  ii future revenue was of our projections in the dcf model  or iii the terminal growth rate used was lower 
none of these sensitivity analyses resulted in an estimated fair value less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
accounting for income taxes 
we calculate our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized by identifying the temporary differences arising from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
in determining the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns  judgment is required 
differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future tax consequences could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
the recognition of deferred tax assets is reduced by a valuation allowance if it is mo re likely than not that the tax benefits will not be realized 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical income  projected future income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are considered permanently reinvested and  accordingly  no provision for us federal or state income taxes has been provided thereon 
effective january   we adopted accounting standards codification asc income taxes asc which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions 
these provisions require recognition of the impact of a tax position in our financial statements only if that position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
any interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions will be reflected in income tax expense 
determining the consolidated provision for income taxes involves judgments  estimates and the application of complex tax regulations 
we are required to provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate  including estimated liabilities for uncertain tax positions 
although we believe that we have provided adequate liabilities for uncertain tax positions  the actual liability resulting from examinations by taxing authorities could differ from the recorded income tax liabilities and could result in additional income tax expense 
in accordance with asc  changes of estimates in our income tax liabilities are reflected in our income tax provision in the period in which the factors resulting in the change to our estimate become known to us 
as a result  our effective income tax rate may fluctuate on a quarterly basis 

table of contents we recognize excess tax benefits associated with share based compensation to stockholders equity only when realized 
when assessing whether excess tax benefits relating to share based compensation have been realized  we follow the with and without approach  excluding any indirect effects of the excess tax deductions 
under this approach  excess tax benefits related to share based compensation are not deemed to be realized until after the utilization of all other tax benefits available to us 
stock compensation 
stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period 
the fair value of our stock based awards is estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes valuation calculation requires us to estimate key assumptions such as expected volatility  expected term and risk free rate of return 
calculation of expected volatility is based on historical volatility 
the expected term is calculated using the c ontractual term of the options as well as an analysis of our historical exercises of stock options 
the estimate of risk free rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
we have never paid cash dividends and do not currently intend to pay cash dividends  thus we have assumed a dividend yield 
we are required to estimate potential forfeitures of stock grants and adjust compensation cost recorded accordingly 
the estimate of forfeitures is based on historical forfeiture performance and will be adjusted over the requisite service period to the extent that actual forfeitures differ  or are expected to differ  from such estimates 
if we use different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods or if actual forfeitures differ materially from our estimated forfeitures  the change in our stock based compensation expense could materially affect our operating income  net income  and net income per share

we have funded our operations to date primarily through the issuance of equity securities in conjunction with an initial public offering in  subsequent option exercises  and our follow on public offering in and cash generated from operations 
our cash reserves are held directly or indirectly in a variety of short term  interest bearing instruments  including obligations of the united states government or agencies thereof and united states corporate debt securities

additionally  actions taken as a result of ongoing internal evaluation of our business could result in expenditures not currently contemplated in our estimates for we believe  however  that our existing c ash and cash equivalents are sufficient to fund our operating expenses  capital equipment requirements and other expected liquidity requirements for the coming twelve months 
factors that could affect our capital requirements  in addition to those listed above include i continued collections of accounts receivable consistent with our historical experience  ii our ability to manage our inventory levels consistent with past practices  iii entering partnership agreements which include significant up front license fees  iv the stock repurchase program and v entering strategic investment or acquisition agreements requiring significant cash consideration 
see also the safe harbor cautionary statement and item a risk factors above 
to the extent our capital resources are insufficient to meet future capital requirements we will have to raise additional funds to continue the development and deployment of our technologies 
there can be no assurance that debt or equity 
table of contents funds will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
to the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of those securities could result in dilution to our stockholders 
moreover  incurring debt financing could result in a substantial portion of our operating cash flow being dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on such indebtedness  could render us more vulnerable to competitive pressures and economic downturns and could impose restrictions on our operations 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to curtail operations significantly or to obtain funds through entering into agreements on unattractive terms debt on december   lmd entered into an agreement with the ministry of industry of the government of canada under which the government agreed to invest up to canadian cdn million relating to the development of several genetic tests 
this agreement was amended in march funds were advanced from technology partnerships canada tpc  a special operating program 
the actual payments we received were predicated on eligible expenditures made during the project period which ended july  lmd has received cdn million from tpc which is expected to be repaid along with approximately cdn million of imputed interest for a total of approximately cdn million 
lmd has agreed to repay the tpc funding through a royalty on revenues 
royalty payments commenced in at a rate of of total revenue and at a rate of for and thereafter 
aggregate royalty repayment will continue until total advances plus imputed interest has been repaid or until december   whichever is earlier 
the repayment obligation expires on december  and any unpaid balance will be cancelled and forgiven on that date 
should the term of repayment be shorter than expected due to higher than expected assay revenue  the effective interest rate would increase as repayment is accelerated 
actual future sales generating a repayment obligation will vary from our projections  is subject to adjustment based upon the us and canadian exchange rate and a re subject to the risks and uncertainties described elsewhere in this report  including under item a risk factors and safe harbor cautionary statement 

table of contents contractual obligations as of december   we had approximately million in non cancelable obligations for the next months 
these obligations are included in our estimated cash usage during the following table reflects our total current non cancelable obligations by period as of december  in thousands payment due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years non cancelable rental obligations non cancelable purchase obligations long term debt obligations total purchase obligations include contractual arrangements in the form of purchase orders primarily as a result of normal inventory purchases or minimum payments due resulting when minimum purchase commitments are not met 
lmd has agreed to repay the long term debt obligations through a royalty on revenues 
repayments denominated in us dollars are currently projected to be as shown in the table above 
the amount due within one year  as shown in the table above  is our estimated repayment amount based on the sales for the full year due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with luminex s unrecognized tax benefits at december   luminex is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the timing of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority 
therefore  million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes 
in addition  million of milestone payments under a collaboration agreement have not been included in the table above as it is not possible to estimate when  or even if  we will make these future potential payments 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a direct adverse effect on our operations to date 
however  a substantial increase in product and manufacturing costs and personnel related expenses could have an adverse impact on our results of operations in the event these expenses increase at a faster pace than we can increase our system  consumable and royalty rates 
recently adopted accounting standards in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb amended its guidance related to subsequent event disclosures 
the amendment eliminates the requirement for sec filers to disclose the date through which an entity has evaluated its subsequent events 
the amendment was effective immediately and we have adopted this guidance 

table of contents in january  the fasb updated its guidance related to fair value measurements and disclosures 
this guidance requires some new disclosures and clarifies some existing disclosure requirements about fair value measurement in order to improve these disclosures and  thus  increase the transparency in financial reporting 
specifically  guidance will require a reporting entity to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements and describe the reasons for the transfers and present separately information about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements in the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs 
in addition  the fasb clarified the disclosure requirements related to the use of judgment in determining the appropriate classes of assets and liabilities when reporting fair value measurement for each class and about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements 
the update is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements in the roll forward of activity in level fair value measurements 
those disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
early application is permitted 
the adoption of this update did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial state ments 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb updated its revenue recognition guidance  amending the criteria for separating consideration in multiple deliverable arrangements 
the amendments establish a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable 
the selling price used for each deliverable will be based on vendor specific objective evidence if available  third party evidence if vendor specific objective evidence is not available  or estimated selling price if neither vendor specific objective evidence nor third party evidence is available 
the amendments will eliminate the residual method of allocation and require that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method 
the relative selling price method allocates any discount in the arrangement proportionally to each deliverable on the basis of each deliverable s selling price 
this update will be effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  early adoption is permitted 
we do not anticipate the adoption of this update to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb updated its revenue recognition guidance related to the milestone method of revenue recognition 
this update provided guidance on defining a milestone and determining when it may be appropriate to apply the milestone method of revenue recognition for research and development transactions 
the update is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june  and is effective on a prospective basis for milestones achieved after the adoption date 
we do not anticipate the adoption of this update to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of domestic interest rates  particularly since our investments are in short term and long term instruments available for sale 
a basis point fluctuation from average investment returns at december  would yield a less than variance in overall investment return  which would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
foreign currency risk 
our international business is subject to risks  including  but not limited to foreign exchange rate volatility  differing tax structures  unique economic conditions  other regulations and restrictions  and changes in political climate 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these and other factors 
as of december   as a result of our foreign operations  we have costs  assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies  primarily canadian and australian dollars and to a lesser extent the euro  renminbi  and yen 
for example  some fixed asset purchases  certain expenses  and the tpc debt of our canadian subsidiary are denominated in canadian dollars while sales of products are primarily denominated in us dollars 
all transactions in our netherlands and japanese subsidiaries are denominated in euros and yen  respectively 
all transactions  with the exception of our initial capital investment  in our chinese subsidiary are denominated in renminbi 
sales transactions in our australian subsidiary are primarily denominated in australian or us dollars while fixed asset purchases and expen ses are primarily denominated in australian dollars 
as a consequence  movements in exchange rates could cause our foreign currency denominated expenses to fluctuate as a percentage of net revenue  affecting our profitability and cash flows 
a significant majority of our revenues are denominated in us dollars 
the impact of foreign exchange on foreign denominated balances will vary in relation to changes between the us dollar  canadian dollar  australian dollar  euro  yen  and renminbi exchange rates 
a change in these exchange rates in relation to the us dollar would result in an income statement impact of approximately  on foreign currency denominated asset and liability balances as of december  as a result of our efforts to expand globally  in the future we will be exposed to additional foreign currency risk in multiple currencies  however  at this time  our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is not material 
in addition  the indirect effect of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 
for example  currency exchange rate fluctuations could affect international demand for our products 
in addition  interest rate fluctuations could affect our customers buying patterns 
furthermore  interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations may broadly influence the united states and foreign economies resulting in a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
as a result  we cannot give any assurance as to the effect that future changes in foreign currency rates will have on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
our a ggregate foreign currency transaction loss of  was included in determining our consolidated results for the year ended december
