overview our business sinohub  inc the company is an electronics company based in shenzhen  pr china which services clients worldwide 
the company is currently engaged in two business segments electronics product manufacturing and sales icm  integrated contract manufacturing  and electronic component sales and services ecss which is comprised of electronic component sales known as ecp and electronic component supply chain management services known as scm 
we now report on icm and ecss as separate business segments 
sinohub s business operations are organized to take full advantage of the power of information exchange between its two business segments icm and ecss 
in this sense  sinohub has become a market maker for our ecss mobile phone design house customers by using them as suppliers in our icm business 
in  our business mix was ecss and icm as compared to ecss in the icm business was immaterial in by  we expect the majority of our revenue will come from our icm segment 
for further information on our performance by reportable segment  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
history and basis of reporting sinohub  inc formerly known as liberty alliance  inc 
is a delaware corporation  originally incorporated in utah in  and subsequently merged and reorganized as liberty alliance  inc in delaware in in may  liberty alliance  inc  its wholly owned subsidiary sinohub acquisition corp  sinohub  inc  and steven l 
white  the principal stockholder of liberty alliance  inc  entered into an agreement and plan of merger pursuant to which sinohub acquisition corp 
merged with and into sinohub  inc and sinohub  inc 
became a wholly owned subsidiary of liberty alliance  inc after completion of the merger  the original stockholders of liberty alliance held approximately of the issued and outstanding shares of liberty alliance  inc common stock on a fully diluted basis and the former stockholders of sinohub  inc  including the shares issued to consultants for services rendered in connection with the merger  held approximately of liberty alliance  inc issued and outstanding shares of common stock 
subsequent to the completion of the merger  on july   liberty alliance  inc amended its certificate of incorporation to change its name to sinohub  inc and affect a to reverse stock split of all issued and outstanding shares of its common stock 
for financial reporting purposes  the reverse takeover of the company has been accounted for as a recapitalization of the company with sinohub international as the accounting acquirer whereby the historical financial statements and operations of sinohub international  inc became the historical financial statements of the company  with no adjustment of the carrying value of the assets and liabilities 
when we refer in this form k to business and financial information for periods prior to the consummation of the reverse acquisition  we are referring to the business and financial information of sinohub international  inc on a consolidated basis unless the context suggests otherwise 
business operations sinohub uses its hong kong warehouse as a staging point for ecss procurement fulfillment programs in which the company purchases components associated with a bill of materials 
sinohub also supports customers by providing a sourcing channel for electronic components that are not part of a specific procurement fulfillment program 
in these cases  sinohub utilizes its industry knowledge and relationships with components suppliers to source products at competitive prices and within time constraints 
sinohub responds to these spot orders from customers  sources the product  confirms pricing  and executes delivery as required 
sinohub carries inventory for its icm business 
we also carry electronic components that we are staging for ecss procurement fulfillment projects 
we never buy components in our ecss business without a corresponding order to purchase the components 
consolidated results of operations the company derived revenue and gross profit in from electronics product manufacturing and sales icm  integrated contract manufacturing  and electronic component sales and services ecss  which is comprised of electronic component sales known as ecp and electronic component supply chain management services known as scm 
scm services are generally provided to all customers these services are integrated into the ecp and icm businesses 
the company recognizes revenue from scm services when the services are provided 
revenue from icm and from ecp is based on quoted prices and is recognized at the time of shipment to customers 
sales are recorded net of discounts and allowances 
in all cases  revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the sales price is determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
cost of sales for scm services primarily represents direct costs incurred for providing scm services  including logistics services  import export services  warehouse services and a number of ancillary services such as kitting  insurance  repackaging and re labeling 
cost of sales for ecp primarily represents the cost of components and expenses directly related to component procurement 
cost of sales for icm represents all costs associated with the operation of the topology factory  the cost of designs purchased from design houses  and the cost of components that go into the manufacturing process 
scm pricing is negotiated based on a percentage of the value of the goods handled 
for ecp  the company makes a margin based on the difference between the price at which it buys electronic components and the price at which it sells these parts to the customer 
the price of products and services delivered in the icm business unit is based on negotiation and gross margin varies with each order 
typically the same mobile phone will be ordered by a customer in a number of different purchase orders over a period of three to four months 
because the price of components generally declines through time  the gross margin on a particular phone generally increases with repeat orders 
selling  general and administrative expenses include salaries paid to employees  employee related expenses  professional fees  marketing costs  technology costs  sales commissions  depreciation  rent  and related office and facility expenses 
fiscal year ended december  compared to december  overall results the company reported net income for the year ended december  of million compared to million in  an increase of 
net sales net sales for the year ended december  were million  up from million recorded in the company reports net sales on the basis of two business segments electronic component sales and supply chain management services collectively ecss  and electronics product manufacturing and sales icm 
in the year ended december   net sales of the ecss segment increased to million from million in in the year ended december   net sales of the icm segment were million 
the net sales in this segment were immaterial during the prior year 
the rapid growth of our integrated contract manufacturing business was supported by sales of new equity in the first quarter of gross profit the company recorded gross profit of million in the year of compared with million in the gross profit margin for the year of increased to from in however  the company intends to deemphasize its electronic component sales aspect of its ecss business over time because as volume increases  ecp gross margins tend to decline because larger customers demand lower pricing and the occasional opportunity for us to make a very high margin transaction caused by a large price discrepancy between what the company buys a component for and its sales price will not have as dramatic an effect on the overall gross profit earned for the period 
operating expenses total operating expenses were million or of revenues in  compared to million  or of revenues in selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in  representing approximately of revenues in compared to in the largest factors in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses from to were salaries and fringe benefits due to the large increase in headcount related to creating the infrastructure for our rapidly expanding icm business 
other significant factors in the increase were customs clearance and management fees  logistics fees  staff travel  and office and warehouse rent to support the general growth in sales and expanded operations 
depreciation was million in  compared to  in with the increase due primarily to additional leasehold improvements 
income from operations the company recorded income from operations of million in  as compared with income from operations of million in income taxes the company recorded income tax expense of million in  as compared with million in the company s effective tax rate was in compared to in income tax estimates in interim periods have varied as the company has adjusted provisions and accruals in light of actual tax filings 
foreign currency translation gain and comprehensive net income the company reported foreign currency translation gains of million in  compared with foreign currency translation gains of  in reflecting increasing valuation of rmb against usd during comprehensive net income net income plus foreign currency translation gains was million in compared with million in consolidated financial condition and liquidity liquidity and capital resources sinohub s strategic plan is focused on the growth of our icm business segment 
in the company will focus on mobile phone sales in indonesia and india 
this will require investment in inventory for icm orders  and  depending on our growth  additional investment in our manufacturing and assembling facilities 
as a result of the working capital investments necessary to support these plans  the company will continue to require cash and financing resources to meet and exceed its objectives 
the company s cost of capital from equity sales increased to with the private financings we closed in march due to market conditions and the participation of an investment bank as placement agent 
our cost of capital with china construction bank  industrial bank  hangzhou bank and bank of ningbo was approximately at december  some of the working capital the company intends to raise in the near to medium term is expected to come from chinese banks  which  to date  have not been affected by the global credit crisis nearly as much as the us and european banks although the credit available through banks in china could be affected by chinese monetary policies 
we will also seek to raise additional capital from multinational banks and in public or private equity offerings 
we believe sinohub s new integrated contract manufacturing business can grow rapidly with the expansion of our manufacturing facility and with additional inventory 
additional working capital would enable us to purchase more electronic components from our suppliers  which should lower our costs  and thus enhance our profitability 
we believe increased volume would also likely enable the company to receive payment terms from suppliers we are currently mainly buying from suppliers on a cod basis which would lessen our need for additional financing from third parties 
accordingly  if sinohub is unsuccessful in raising additional working capital and does not obtain payment terms from suppliers  the company s growth may be adversely affected 
we intend to raise additional funds through the sale of additional equity or debt  long term debt financings  and operating cash flows 
due to the risk factors discussed elsewhere in this report  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising the additional funds necessary to carry out management s plans for the future on acceptable terms or at all 
our ability to obtain additional capital will also depend on market conditions  national and global economies and other factors beyond our control 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to implement or capitalize on various financing alternatives 
the terms of any debt or equity funding that we may obtain in the future may be unfavorable to us and to our stockholders 
at december  and december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million and million  respectively 
during  the net amount of cash used in the company s operating activities was  the net amount of cash used in investing activities was million  and the net amount of cash provided by financing activities was million 
the company must generally pay the purchase price of electronic components for procurement fulfillment customers and then recoup the purchase price from the customer after delivery 
we only purchase standard components which are readily saleable 
to date we have not had any collection problems with any procurement fulfillment project funded 
the company s borrowings vary based on the timing of procurement fulfillment projects  large spot component sales  use of our vat import line and use of our export reimbursement line 
cash flows from operating activities the company maintains a significant investment in working capital  primarily accounts receivable and inventories 
accounts receivable at december  were million  an increase of million  or  as compared to accounts receivable of million at december  however  the accounts receivable and inventories represented approximately of total assets at december   as compared to at december  the net amount of cash used in the company s operating activities during the year of was  which primarily included earnings from operations that were offset by investments in accounts receivable and inventory  as well as deposit to suppliers to support the company s business growth 
the net amount of cash used in the company s operating activities during the year of was million  which primarily included earnings from operations that were more than offset by investments in accounts receivable and inventory to support the company s business growth 
cash flows from investing activities the net amount of cash used by investing activities during was million  the result of restricted cash buildup and building out our icm manufacturing infrastructure 
the net amount of cash used by investing activities during the year of was million primarily the result of a restricted cash buildup 
cash flows from financing activities the net amount of cash provided by financing activities during the year of was million  which primarily included proceeds from bank borrowings of million and private placement stock offerings yielding net proceeds of million  offset by payments on bank loans of million 
the net amount of cash provided by financing activities during the year of was million  which included proceeds from bank borrowings of million  private placement stock offerings yielding net proceeds of million  and exercises of warrants to purchase common stock yielding net proceeds of million  offset by payments on bank loans of million 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to our investors 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including but not limited to those related to income taxes and impairment of long lived assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions and factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
based on our ongoing review  we plan to adjust to our judgments and estimates where facts and circumstances dictate 
actual r esults could differ from our estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require our management most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
concentrations and risks substantially all of company assets are located in the prc and hong kong and roughly ninety percent of the company s revenues in were derived from business related to the mobile phone industry 
in addition  financial instruments that potentially subject the company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of accounts receivable 
the company mitigates credit risk through procedures that include determination of credit limits  credit approvals  and related monitoring procedures to ensure delinquent receivables are collected 
cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statements of cash flows  cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and demand deposits with a bank with a maturity of less than three months 
cash amounts held as security for the company s bank loans are reported as restricted cash and are not included with cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet until the security for such funds has been released 
accounts receivable the company extends unsecured credit to its customers in the ordinary course of business but mitigates the associated risks by performing credit checks and actively pursuing past due accounts 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is established and recorded based on managements assessment of customer credit history  overall trends in collections and write offs  and expected exposures based on facts and prior experience 
inventories inventories are stated at lower of cost or market value  cost being determined on a first in first out method 
no allowance is made for excess or obsolete inventories as inventories are held for a short period of time and are substantially related to specific customer order commitments 
inventory consists of electronic components purchased from suppliers and electronics products the company manufactured 
property and equipment property and equipment are stated at cost  less accumulated depreciation 
expenditures for additions  major renewals and betterments are capitalized and expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred 
depreciation is provided on a straight line basis  less estimated residual values over the assets estimated useful lives 
the estimated useful lives are as follows plant and machinery years motor vehicles years furniture  fixtures and equipment to years leasehold improvements over the unexpired lease terms long lived assets held and used by the company are reviewed for impairment whenever changes in circumstances or events indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
for purposes of evaluating the recoverability of long lived assets  the company considers various factors  including future cash flows  to determine whether the carrying amount exceeds fair value  and in that case  the asset is written down to fair value 
financial instruments the company analyzes all financial instruments that may have features of both liabilities and equity under asc topic and asc topic at present  there are no such instruments in the financial statements 
the company also analyzes registration rights agreements associated with any equity instruments issued to determine if penalties triggered for late filing should be accrued under asc topic at present  there are no registration rights as to which late filing penalties may apply 
fair value of financial instruments asc topic requires certain disclosures regarding the fair value of financial instruments 
fair value of financial instruments is made at a specific point in time  based on relevant information about financial markets and specific financial instruments 
as these estimates are subjective in nature  involving uncertainties and matters of significant judgment  they cannot be determined with precision 
changes in assumptions can significantly affect estimated fair values 
asc topic defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
when determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value  the company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and it considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability 
asc topic establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value 
a financial instrument s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
asc topic establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value level level applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level level applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices included within level that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets  quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions less active markets  or model derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from  or corroborated by  observable market data 
level level applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
the carrying value of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable  accrued expenses  bank borrowings  and other liabilities approximate their fair values because of the short term nature of these instruments 
management believes the company is not exposed to significant interest or credit risks arising from these financial instruments 
the company s operations are primarily based in the prc  which may give rise to significant foreign currency risks and opportunities from fluctuations and the degree of volatility of foreign exchange rates between the united states dollar usd and the chinese renminbi rmb 
in july  the prc allowed the rmb to fluctuate within a narrow range ending its decade old valuation peg to the usd 
since this change in  the rmb has experienced positive trends in valuation against the usd  such trends are reflected in part by the foreign currency translation gains reported in the company s financial statements 
derivative instruments the company does not utilize derivative or hedge instruments in its financing activities 
stock based compensation the company adopted asc topic this statement requires a public entity to measure the cost of services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which services are received 
stock compensation for stock granted to non employees has been determined in accordance with asc topic and asc topic  as the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of equity instruments issued  whichever is more reliably measured 
revenue and cost recognition the company reports revenue from electronics product manufacturing and sales icm  integrated contract manufacturing  and electronic component sales and services ecss  which is comprised of electronic component sales known as ecp and electronic component supply chain management services known as scm 
revenues for scm services are earned from both the scm and procurement fulfillment programs and are primarily based on a percentage of inventory value handled for a customer 
the company recognizes revenue from scm services when the services are provided 
revenues from ecp and icm businesses are based on quoted prices and are recognized at the time of shipment to customers 
revenues are recognized on the gross amount billed to customers 
sales are recorded net of discounts and allowances 
in all cases  revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the sales price is determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
cost of goods sold in icm business includes the direct raw material cost  direct labor cost  manufacturing overheads including depreciation of production equipment  rent  shipping and handling costs  and local transportation charges consistent with the revenue earned 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under asc topic under asc topic  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income taxes in the period that included the enactment date

recent accounting pronouncements in december  fasb issued asu business combinations topic disclosure of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations 
the objective of this update is to address diversity in practice about the interpretation of the pro forma revenue and earnings disclosure requirements for business combinations 
the amendments in this update specify that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements  the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination s that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only 
the amendments also expand the supplemental pro forma disclosu res to include a description of the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings 
the amendments in this update are effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  early adoption is permitted 
management is currently evaluating the potential impact of asu on the company s financial statements 
in december  fasb issued asu intangibles goodwill and other topic when to perform step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
the amendments in this update affect all entities that have recognized goodwill and have one or more reporting units whose carrying amount for purposes of performing step of the goodwill impairment test is zero or negative 
the amendments in this update modify step so that for those reporting units  an entity is required to perform step of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
in determining whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists  an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist 
the qualitative factors are consistent with existing guidance  which requires that goodwill of a reporting unit be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
for public entities  the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  early adoption is not permitted 
upon adoption of the amendments  an entity with reporting units that have carrying amounts that are zero or negative is required to assess whether it is more likely than not that the reporting units goodwill is impaired 
if the entity determines that it is more likely than not that the goodwill of one or more of its reporting units is impaired  the entity should perform step of the goodwil l impairment test for those reporting unit s 
any resulting goodwill impairment should be recorded as a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings in the period of adoption 
any goodwill impairments occurring after the initial adoption of the amendments should be included in earnings as required by section the adoption of asu did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
in august  fasb issued asu accounting for various topics technical corrections to sec paragraphs sec update 
this accounting standards update amends various sec paragraphs based on external comments received and the issuance of sab  which amends or rescinds portions of certain sab topics 
the adoption of asu did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
in august  fasb issued asu accounting for technical amendments to various sec rules and schedules 
amendments to sec paragraphs pursuant to release no 
technical amendments to rules  forms  schedules and codification of financial reporting policies 
this accounting standards update amends various sec paragraphs pursuant to the issuance of release no 
technical amendments to rules  forms  schedules and codification of financial reporting policies 
the adoption of asu did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued asu receivable topic disclosure about the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses 
the objective of this guidance is to provide financial statement users with greater transparency about an entity s allowance for credit losses and the credit quality of its financing receivables 
the guidance requires an entity to provide disclosures on a disaggregated basis on two defined levels portfolio segment  and class of financing receivable 
the guidance includes additional disclosure requirements about financing receivables  including credit quality indicators of financing receivables at the end of the reporting period by class of fina ncing receivables  the aging of past due financing receivables at the end of the reporting period by class of financing receivables  and the nature and extent of troubled debt restructurings that occurred during the period by class of financing receivables and their effect on the allowance for credit losses 
in january  fasb issued asu the amendments in this update temporarily delay the effective date of the disclosures about troubled debt restructurings in accounting standards update no 
 receivables topic disclosures about the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses for public entities 
the delay is intended to allow the board time to complete its deliberations on what constitutes a troubled debt restructuring 
the effective date of the new disclosures about troubled debt restructurings for public entities and the guidance for determining what constitutes a troubled debt restruct uring will then be coordinated 
the deferral in this amendment is effective upon issuance 
management is currently evaluating the potential impact of asu and asu on the company s financial statements 
in april  fasb issued asu compensation stock compensation topic effect of denominating the exercise price of a share based payment award in the currency of the market in which the underlying equity security trades 
asu addresses the classification of a share based payment award with an exercise price denominated in the currency of a market in which the underlying equity security trades 
topic is amended to clarify that a share based payment award with an exercise price denominated in the currency of a market in which a substantial portion of the entity s equity securities trades shall not be considered to contain a market  performance  or service condition 
therefore  such an award is not to be classified as a liability if it otherw ise qualifies as equity classification 
the amendments in this update should be effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  the guidance should be applied by recording a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings for all outstanding awards as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which the amendments are initially applied 
management is currently evaluating the potential impact of asu on our financial statements 
in march  fasb issued asu scope exception related to embedded credit derivatives asu 
asu clarifies the type of embedded credit derivative that is exempt from embedded derivative bifurcation requirements 
only one form of embedded credit derivative qualifies for the exemption one that is related only to the subordination of one financial instrument to another 
as a result  entities that have contracts containing an embedded credit derivative feature in a form other than such subordination may need to separately account for the embedded credit derivative feature 
the amendments in this update are effective for each reporting entity at the beginning of its first fiscal quarter beginning after june  ea rly adoption is permitted at the beginning of each entity s first fiscal quarter beginning after issuance of this update 
the company does not expect the adoption of asu to have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations or financial position 
item a
