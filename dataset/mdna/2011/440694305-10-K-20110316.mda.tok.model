table of contents part i item business horsehead holding corp 
is the parent company of horsehead corporation  a leading us producer of specialty zinc and zinc based products and a leading recycler of electric arc furnace dust horsehead  and the international metals reclamation company  inc a leading recycler of nickel bearing wastes and nickel cadmium ni cd batteries in north america inmetco that we acquired on december  we have production and or recycling operations at seven facilities in five states 
we also own and operate on our premises a megawatt coal fired power plant that provides us with a captive source of electricity and allows us to sell approximately one fifth of its capacity 
our products are used in a wide variety of applications  including in the galvanizing of fabricated steel products  as components in rubber tires  alkaline batteries  paint  chemicals and pharmaceuticals and as a remelt alloy in the production of stainless steel 
we believe that we are the largest refiner of zinc oxide and prime western pw zinc metal  a grade of zinc containing a minimum of zinc  in north america 
we believe we are also the largest north american recycler of electric arc furnace eaf dust  a hazardous waste produced by the carbon steel mini mill manufacturing process 
through our inmetco operations  we believe we are also a leading recycler of eaf dust and other nickel bearing waste generated by specialty steel producers and a leading recycler of ni cd batteries in north america 
we  together with our predecessors  have been operating in the zinc industry for more than years and in the nickel bearing waste industry for more than years 
as a result of the acquisition of inmetco  we now operate as two business segments 
while we vary our raw material inputs  or feedstocks  based on cost and availability  we generally produce our zinc products using recycled zinc  including zinc recovered from our four eaf dust recycling operations located in four states 
we believe that our ability to convert recycled zinc into finished products results in lower feed costs than for smelters that rely primarily on zinc concentrates 
our four eaf dust recycling facilities also generate service fee revenue from steel mini mills by providing a convenient and safe means for recycling their eaf dust 
in  we commenced operations at our fourth eaf dust processing facility located in south carolina 
inmetco provides recycling services  some of which are on a tolling basis  from a single production facility in ellwood city  pennsylvania 
during  we sold approximately million pounds of zinc products and million pounds of nickel based products  generally priced at amounts based on premiums to zinc and nickel prices on the london metals exchange lme 
for the year ended december   we generated sales and net income of million and million  respectively 
competitive strengths leading market positions and strategically located recycling facilities we believe that we are the largest refiner of zinc oxide and pw zinc metal in north america  based on capacity  and that as a result of the inmetco acquisition we are a leading recycler of nickel bearing waste material generated by the stainless and specialty steel industry and a leading recycler of nickel bearing batteries 
we also believe that we are the largest north american recycler of eaf dust and that we currently recycle more than half of all eaf dust generated in the united states 
in addition  our four company owned eaf dust recycling facilities are strategically located near major eaf operators  reducing transportation costs and enhancing our ability to compete effectively with other means of eaf dust disposal 
we believe that the location of our facilities  together with our competitive cost position  extensive zinc distribution network and proprietary market knowledge  will enable us to maintain our leading market positions and continue to capture market share in zinc products  zinc recycling and nickel bearing waste recycling 
strong relationships with diverse customer base we believe that our product quality  reputation for on time delivery and competitive pricing enable us to maintain strong relationships with a broad base of customers in each of our end markets 
for example  we believe we are the leading supplier of zinc metal to the after fabrication hot dip segment of the north american galvanizing industry 
we also sell zinc oxide to over producers of tire and rubber products  chemicals  paints  plastics and 
table of contents pharmaceuticals 
we have supplied zinc oxide to nine of our current ten largest zinc oxide customers for over ten years  and we believe that we are the sole or primary supplier of zinc to most of our customers 
in addition  the us environmental protection agency epa has designated our recycling processes as best demonstrated available technology in the area of high temperature metals recovery related to the processing of eaf dust from both carbon steel mini mill and stainless steel producers 
we are the largest recycler of eaf dust in the us  and we now recycle eaf dust for nine of north america s ten largest carbon steel eaf operators and north america s three largest stainless steel producers  based on production volume 
we are working to expand our recycling capacity further in order to better service these and other customers 
in addition  inmetco provides environmental services to over customers that generate nickel containing waste products such as filter cake  spent pickle liquor  grinding swarf and mill scale 
inmetco also collects and recycles batteries from the rechargeable battery recycling corporation  founded in by five major rechargeable battery makers  as well as through its own collection programs 
low cost feedstock sources we believe that we are the only zinc smelter in north america with the proven ability to refine zinc metal and zinc oxide using recycled zinc feedstocks 
our use of large amounts of recycled feedstock reduces our exposure to increases in lme zinc prices and increases our operating margins during periods of high lme zinc prices 
in addition  our eaf dust recycling operations provide us with a reliable  cost effective source of recycled zinc without relying on third party sellers 
proven  proprietary technology with flexible processes since our recycling processes convert eaf dust and other wastes into saleable products  our customers generally face less exposure to environmental liabilities from eaf dust  which the epa classifies as a listed hazardous waste  than if they disposed of their eaf dust in landfills 
in addition  we believe our zinc smelter and refinery in monaca  pennsylvania is unique in its ability to refine zinc using almost any form of zinc bearing feedstock 
this flexibility allows us to modify our feedstock mix based on cost and availability  as well as to use recycled zinc feedstock  whether purchased from third parties at a discount to the lme zinc price or generated by our eaf dust recycling operations 
we believe that inmetco s recycling process is a successful technology for the recycling of a broad range of nickel bearing waste products 
inmetco has successfully licensed this technology in the past 
strong  experienced management team our eight member senior management team collectively has over years of experience in zinc and metal related industries 
james m 
hensler  our chief executive officer  joined us in early and has since established a culture of continuous improvement in safety and operational excellence  which has led to significant cost reductions  productivity improvements and growth 
business strategy continue to focus on production efficiencies and operating cost reductions we have reduced our manufacturing costs by increasing our usage of low cost feedstock  streamlining our organizational structure and implementing six sigma a business process improvement methodology initiatives  and we intend to continue to focus on these and similar initiatives in the future 
as part of our six sigma initiatives  we made a series of operating improvements at certain facilities 
for example  at our calumet plant we have reduced the amount of non zinc materials fed to our smelter  thereby reducing operating costs by approximately million on an annual basis without significant capital expenditures 
two projects  one directed at identifying better materials of construction for sinter machine pallets at our monaca smelter  and the other  aimed at improving calcining process control at our palmerton facility  have reduced our sinter machine pallet repair costs at monaca by approximately million annually 
we also automated key operational parameters for the zinc smelting furnaces at monaca leading to a more consistent operation and steadily improving our yields  which resulted in a cost savings of approximately million in finally  in response to the significant decrease in 
table of contents demand for zinc metals resulting from the economic downturn that began in the third quarter of  we took aggressive steps to reduce our operating costs  including the shutdown of our smallest and highest cost recycling facility in beaumont  texas  reductions in the price paid for purchased feedstock as a percentage of the lme price  a reduction of our salaried and temporary workforce and a cost saving revision to our construction strategy for our recently completed south carolina facility 
in  we idled our bartlesville  oklahoma hydrometallurgical facility and began outsourcing the processing of the lead bearing material at reduced costs 
please see our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a further discussion of the economic downturn and the accompanying decrease in demand 
we recently announced the completion of a preliminary feasibility study to construct a  ton per year zinc plant based on state of the art green technology 
the goals of the proposed plant would be to produce zinc at much lower costs  to significantly reduce air emissions and to provide opportunities for us to serve the broader market for special high grade zinc and the continuous galvanizing market  in addition to our traditional zinc markets 
if our board of directors approves this project and if we secure financing for this project  construction may start before the end of expand eaf dust recycling capacity we estimate that in approximately one third of the carbon steel eaf dust generated per year was deposited in landfills in the united states  including by existing customers 
since then  new eaf steel plant projects have come online  further increasing eaf dust generation in the united states 
due to productivity  capital and operating cost efficiencies relative to integrated steel mills  the mini mill share of the us steel market has doubled in the last ten years and is expected to account for over of us steel produced by  according to the steel manufacturers association 
steel mini mill operators have increasingly relied on recyclers rather than landfills to manage this increased output 
in order to grow our eaf dust recycling business  we placed a new kiln with an annual eaf dust recycling capacity of  tons into production in early at our facility in rockwood  tennessee and placed into production two kilns with a combined annual capacity of  tons at our new facility in barnwell  south carolina in we entered into a long term contract with a major us steel mini mill producer to process all of the eaf dust generated at its facilities located near our new plant 
in  we acquired the eaf dust contracts held by envirosafe services of ohio  inc esoi  a leading landfill disposer of eaf dust 
in addition to generating additional service fees  we expect that our new kilns will provide us with additional low cost recycled zinc that we can use in our own smelting process or that we can sell as feed to other zinc smelters 
we estimate that with the increased recycling capacity  less than of the eaf dust generated is now deposited in landfills 
diversify and expand environmental services business our core strengths relate to our proven ability to manage hazardous and non hazardous wastes generated by industrial processes and our experience and capabilities to recover valuable metals from these waste streams 
we expect to expand our environmental services business into a broader range of metal bearing wastes 
the acquisition of inmetco is an example of this diversification and we believe that inmetco will be a platform for further growth 
we expect to continue to pursue capital investment and acquisition opportunities in this area and believe this will reduce our exposure to changes in zinc prices 
continue to reduce exposure to commodity price fluctuations we sourced approximately of our zinc feedstock in from our eaf dust recycling operations 
this source of feedstock is not significantly impacted by changes in lme zinc prices 
we will continue to evaluate our zinc price hedging alternatives considering the costs and benefits in light of the commodity price environment  hedging transaction costs and the extent to which we are able to increase the percentage of zinc we acquire from our recycling operations 
we hedged approximately of our expected production of zinc in and through the purchase of put options whereby we would receive a minimum price per pound for the quantity hedged 
we paid a total of million for the options and received million in cash as the options settled 
in october  we sold the put options for million  resulting in a million gain 
we replaced the options with similar options having a strike price of per pound for a cost of million 
in  we purchased put options for approximately of our expected production of zinc in having a strike price of per pound 
in  we purchased put options for having a strike price of per pound at a cost of million 
the 
table of contents purchases represent approximately of our expected zinc production in we also sold put options for having a strike price of per pound and received million 
the options we purchased provide that we will receive a minimum of per pound for the quantity hedged and the options we sold provide that the buyer will receive a minimum of per pound for the quantity hedged 
the remainder of our zinc feedstock costs are derived primarily from zinc secondaries which use lme based pricing  and therefore are somewhat naturally hedged against changes in the lme price 
we have also entered into forward contracts for the purchase of coal for a fixed price through the end of we believe that locking in a price for coal  which comprised approximately of our energy costs in  will stabilize our production costs and reduce the risk of coal supply interruptions 
pursue new markets  applications and acquisition opportunities we intend to continue to leverage our technical expertise  culture of innovation and close customer relationships in order to identify and pursue new markets and applications for our products 
for example  we are currently testing new  higher margin applications for iron rich material  a co product of eaf dust recycling  such as its potential uses as a low cost feed for iron and steel production  its use as a passive water treatment medium at coal mining sites that have acidic mine drainage and as a daily cover or base material for municipal landfills to reduce ground water contamination 
we are also evaluating new markets for our zinc powder  and we expect that our expanded eaf dust recycling capacity will allow us to enter new markets for the sale of crude zinc oxide czo to other zinc smelters in the us and internationally 
in addition  we believe inmetco provides new potential platforms for growth  including increasing capacity of the existing facility  growing our share of the battery recycling market  recycling other industrial wastes to recover metals in addition to nickel and enabling us to expand internationally 
we also intend to continue to identify and explore strategic acquisition opportunities 
our history we  together with the previous owners of our assets  have been operating in the zinc industry for more than years 
horsehead industries  inc hii was formed as a result of several purchases of assets and entities that substantially form our existing company 
in  record low zinc prices  production inefficiencies  high operational costs and legacy environmental costs associated with prior owners operators of our facilities caused hii to file for chapter bankruptcy protection 
an affiliate of sun capital partners  inc together with its affiliates  sun capital purchased substantially all of the operating assets and assumed limited liabilities of hii in december pursuant to a sale order under section of the us bankruptcy code 
sun capital assisted us in hiring our current chief executive officer and chief financial officer in  and since that time we have implemented significant operational improvements as well as experienced significantly improved industry conditions 
as a result of certain transactions in  sun capital and its affiliates no longer own any of our outstanding common stock 
on november   we completed the private placement of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
on april   we completed the private placement of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
we used the net proceeds of the offerings primarily to repurchase shares and redeem warrants held by our pre november stockholders including sun capital 
on august   we completed the public offering of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share less discounts and commissions of as part of an underwritten public offering 
we used a portion of the net proceeds to retire substantially all debt and used the remaining net proceeds of the public offering to fund capital expansion and improvements and for general corporate purposes 
on august   the sec declared effective a registration statement that registered for resale up to  shares of our common stock issued in our and private placements 
in june  we acquired the eaf dust collection business of esoi  the largest land filler in our market 
as part of this acquisition  we purchased their eaf dust contracts  one of which was for years with a major midwestern producer 
we did not acquire their landfill or landfill operations 
in september  we completed an underwritten public offering of  shares of common stock at per share 
on december   we acquired inmetco 

table of contents operations our zinc recycling facilities recycle eaf dust into czo and zinc calcine  which we then use as raw material feedstocks in the production of zinc metal and value added zinc products 
our inmetco facility recycles a broad range of nickel bearing wastes into a remelt alloy product used in the production of stainless steel 
our recycling and production operations form a complete recycling loop  as illustrated below  from recycled metals to finished zinc or nickel bearing products 
we believe we are the only primary zinc producer in the us that uses recycled materials for substantially all of its zinc feedstocks 
diagram horsehead operations horsehead operates four hazardous waste recycling facilities for the recovery of zinc from eaf dust 
our recycling process has been designated by the epa as a best demonstrated available technology for the processing of eaf dust 
our recycling facilities are strategically located near sources of eaf dust production 
these facilities recover zinc from eaf dust generated primarily by carbon steel mini mill manufacturers during the melting of steel scrap  as well as from other waste material 
we extract zinc from eaf dust  and recycle the other components of eaf dust into non hazardous materials  using our proprietary waelz kiln process at our palmerton  rockwood and calumet facilities 
our waelz kiln recycling process blends  conditions  adds carbon to and pelletizes eaf dust  and then feeds it into the kiln itself  a refractory lined tube that is approximately feet in length and feet in diameter 
during the passage through the kiln  the material is heated under reducing conditions at temperatures exceeding  degrees celsius  thereby volatilizing the nonferrous metals  including zinc 
the resulting volatized gas stream is oxidized and collected as czo  which has a zinc content of between and 
in addition  we produce iron rich material that we sell for use as an aggregate in asphalt and as an iron source in cement 
the majority of the czo generated is shipped to our palmerton facility  where it is further refined in a process  called calcining  whereby we heat the material to drive off impurities 
through this rotary kiln process  which is fired with natural gas  the zinc content is further increased to approximately to  and the product is collected as zinc calcine in granular form for shipment to our monaca facility or sale to other zinc refineries around the world 
the metal concentrate product from the calcining process is shipped to a third party processor for final metals recovery 
we have added a washing facility to remove chlorine at our smelting facility to allow us to ship an increasing amount of czo directly as a feed to our monaca facility 
in order to expand our eaf dust recycling capacity  we brought an  tons per year kiln online at our rockwood  tennessee facility in january at a cost of approximately million 
this kiln provides approximately  tons of zinc that we either use directly in our own smelting process or sell as feed to other zinc smelters 
in  we brought a new  tons per year kiln facility online in barnwell  south carolina for a total investment of approximately million 

table of contents production our  ton per year capacity electrothermic zinc smelter and refinery in monaca produces zinc metal and value added zinc products eg  zinc oxide using a wide range of feedstocks  including zinc generated by our recycling operations  zinc secondary material from galvanizers and other users of zinc 
this uniquely flexible electrothermic smelter and refinery in monaca provides a substantial competitive advantage both in raw material costs where we are able to use a wide range of zinc bearing feedstocks and in finished products where  together with our refining operations  we can produce a wide range of zinc metal and value added zinc products 
as a result of reduced demand for our zinc products resulting from the economic downturn that began in the third quarter of and extended through  we operated our smelting and refinery facility at less than capacity in  producing  tons of zinc 
our smelting facility returned to operating at full capacity during we produced  tons of zinc in our monaca smelter is the only smelter in north america that is able to use this wide range of feedstocks  including recycled feedstocks  to produce our zinc products 
our unique ability to vary our feedstock blend lowers our overall raw materials costs without corresponding reductions in product quality  as compared to other zinc smelters and refiners  which generally can accept only a narrow slate of specific mined zinc concentrates and only small amounts of recycled materials 
we also own and operate a megawatt coal fired power plant at our monaca facility which provides us with a captive source of electricity and allows us to sell approximately one fifth of its capacity 
the monaca facility operates on a hours per day  days per year basis to maximize efficiency and output 
eaf sourced calcine and other purchased secondary zinc materials are processed through a sintering operation 
the sintering process converts this combined zinc feedstock into a uniform  hard  porous material suitable for the electrothermic furnaces 
monaca s seven electrothermic furnaces are the key to monaca s production flexibility 
sintered feedstock and metallic zinc secondary materials are mixed with metallurgical coke and fed directly into the top of the furnaces 
metallic zinc vapor is drawn from the furnaces into a vacuum condenser  which is then tapped to produce molten zinc metal 
this metal is then either cast as slab zinc metal  or conveyed directly to the zinc refinery in liquid form 
this integrated facility reduces costs by eliminating the need to cast and then remelt the zinc to refinery feed 
at the refinery  the molten zinc is fed directly through distillation columns to produce an ultra high purity zinc vapor that is condensed into thermally refined special special high grade sshg zinc metal or processed through a combustion chamber into zinc oxide 
the condensed metal is either sold or sent for further conversion into zinc powder 
damage caused by an explosion at the refinery in late july  halted production 
production was resumed at a reduced rate in november and was able to meet market demand by the end of the year 
we believe that our thermally produced sshg zinc metal is among the purest and highest quality sshg zinc metal sold in north america 
our zinc oxide is processed and separately refined through our highly automated  zinc oxide screening  coating and packing facility which is the largest in north america  to create one of our grades of zinc oxide with iso certification 
our product development lab  located at our monaca site  is designed for production of specially engineered zinc oxide products for unique high tech applications 
one such product is an extremely fine particle size micronized zinc oxide that may be used in cosmetic and pharmaceutical applications 

table of contents the chart below describes the flow of our operations  beginning with the input of raw materials  continuing through the production processes and identifying finished products and end uses for each such raw material 
flow chart products and services we offer a wide variety of zinc products and services 
in  we sold approximately  tons of zinc products 
the following are our primary zinc products 
zinc metal our primary zinc metal product is pw zinc metal  which we sell to the hot dip galvanizing and brass industries 
we also produce sshg zinc metal  which is used as feed for the manufacture of high purity zinc powder and zinc alloys 
sshg zinc metal is an ultra pure grade of zinc exceeding the american society for testing and materials standard for special high grade zinc 
our zinc metal is recognized within the galvanizing industry for its consistent quality and appearance 
we believe we are the leading supplier of zinc metal to the after fabrication hot dip segment of the north american galvanizing industry  which uses our zinc metal to provide a protective coating to a myriad of fabricated products  from pipe and guard rails to heat exchangers and telecommunications towers 
we also sell pw zinc metal for use in the production of brass  a zinc copper alloy 
we believe that our operational standards and proximity to customers allow us to deliver higher quality metal than many of our competitors 
to accommodate various customer handling needs  our zinc metal is sold in numerous forms  from pound slabs to  pound ingots 
zinc oxide we sell over different grades of zinc oxide with differing particle sizes  shapes  coatings and purity levels 
zinc oxide is an important ingredient in the production of tire and rubber products  chemicals  ceramics  plastics  paints  lubricating oils and pharmaceuticals 
various end uses for zinc oxide include the following 
tire and rubber applications 
zinc oxide aids in the vulcanization process  acts as a strengthening and reinforcing agent  provides uv protection  and enhances thermal and electrical properties 
there is approximately a half pound of zinc oxide in a typical automobile tire 
chemical applications 
in motor oil  zinc oxide is used to reduce oxidation  inhibit corrosion and extend the wear of automotive engines 
in plastics  zinc oxide is an effective uv stabilizer for polypropylene and polyethylene 
ceramics 
ceramics containing zinc oxide are used in electronic components 
for example  in ceramic varistors surge protectors  zinc oxide allows for high temperature stability  resistance to electrical load  current shock and humidity 
other applications 
in paints  zinc oxide provides mold and mildew protection  functions as a white pigment and provides uv protection and chalking resistance 
in pharmaceutical applications  zinc oxide operates as a sunscreen  a vitamin supplement and a medicinal ointment 

table of contents eaf dust recycling we created the market for eaf dust recycling for carbon steel mini mill producers with the development of our recycling technology in the early s  which has since been designated by the epa as the best demonstrated available technology for processing of eaf dust  a hazardous waste generated by steel mini mills 
to date  we have recycled over million tons of eaf dust equivalent to million tons of zinc  representing the dust generated in the production of over million tons of steel 
we believe the recycling and conversion of eaf dust reduces the steel mini mill s exposure to environmental liabilities which may arise when the eaf dust is sent to a landfill 
in  we recycled  tons of eaf dust compared to  tons in the increase in processing from was the result of our acquisition of the eaf dust contracts held by esoi and increased production in the steel industry in  brought about by the gradual strengthening of the economy 
the installation of a new waelz kiln in rockwood in early january increased our recycling capacity by  net tons  or 
we commenced operations at our new kiln facility in south carolina in  adding an additional  tons  or  of eaf dust processing capacity 
in june  we acquired the eaf dust collection business of esoi  the largest land filler in our market 
as part of this acquisition we purchased esoi s eaf dust contracts  one of which was a ten year contract with a major midwestern producer  and obtained a year non compete agreement from esoi 
czo and calcine sales in response to the strong demand for zinc bearing feed materials and attractive pricing  we began selling czo generated in our waelz kilns to other zinc smelters in we plan to continue selling czo from time to time based on market conditions 
zinc powder and copper based powders our zinc powder is sold for use in a variety of chemical  metallurgical and battery applications as well as for use in corrosion resistant coating applications 
zinc powder is manufactured by the atomization of molten zinc 
we manufacture the following three basic lines of powders at our palmerton facility 
special zinc powders 
these are used in general chemical and metallurgical applications  and in friction applications  such as brake linings for automobiles 
battery grade zinc powders 
these are used in most types of alkaline batteries  as well as mercuric oxide  silver oxide and zinc air batteries 
copper based powders 
these include brass  bronze and nickel silver powders 
these products are used in a variety of applications  including brazing and infiltrating and for powdered metallurgical hardware  such as lock bodies  valves and gears 
sales and marketing horsehead s sales and marketing staff consists of a sales and marketing group comprised of sales professionals whose goal is to develop and maintain excellent customer relationships and provide key market analysis  a customer service department responsible for processing zinc orders  scheduling product shipments and answering customer inquiries  and a technical service staff highly trained to assist zinc customers with specification development  new applications  process improvements and on site troubleshooting assistance when needed 
our process engineering group provides additional technical help to our eaf clients with monthly eaf analytical information and assistance with any problems encountered on eaf dust chemistry  transportation and environmental matters 
our quality assurance department provides extensive laboratory services critical to 
table of contents maintaining in plant process control and providing customer support by certifying compliance to hundreds of unique product specifications 
we are iso certified 
our laboratory also offers sales and technical services support by assisting in new product developments and troubleshooting various application and processing issues both in plant and with specific customers 
we also rely on a network of distributors with warehouses throughout north america that assist us with supporting smaller customers 
customers most of the zinc metal we produce is purchased by galvanizers and brass producers 
we believe we are the leading supplier of zinc metal to the after fabrication hot dip segment of the north american galvanizing industry 
we sell zinc metal to a broad group of approximately hot dip galvanizers 
in many cases  these customers are also suppliers of secondary materials  including zinc remnants of steel galvanizing processes  to us 
we sell zinc oxide to over different customers under contract as well as on a spot basis  principally to manufacturers of tire and rubber products  lubricating oils  chemicals  paints  ceramics  plastics and pharmaceuticals 
our sshg zinc metal product is used in the manufacturing of zinc powder for the alkaline battery industry 
we typically enter into multi year service contracts with steel mini mills to recycle their eaf dust 
we provide our eaf dust recycling services to over steel producing facilities 
raw material in  approximately of the raw material used in our monaca facility was sourced through our eaf dust recycling operations 
the remaining of the raw material was comprised of zinc secondaries  which are principally zinc containing remnants of steel galvanizing processes  including top drosses  bottom drosses and skimmings that we purchase primarily from several of our metal customers 
the prices of zinc secondaries vary according to the amount of recoverable zinc contained  and provide us with a diverse portfolio of low cost inputs from which to choose 
in addition to the dross and skims from the galvanizing industry  we purchase other types of zinc bearing residues from the zinc  brass and alloying industries 
many of these materials are acquired from our own customers 
we also buy czo from one of the other us based eaf dust recyclers 
in addition  we also have long standing relationships with zinc brokers in north america  europe and south america 
these brokers in some cases act as an agent for us and are favorably located to supply us with reliable and cost effective zinc feedstock 
power plant and fuels we rely on a combination of purchased and internally generated electricity for our operations 
we generate substantially all of our electricity requirements for monaca at our on site power plant  using powder river basin prb coal as our principal input 
sales of excess power capacity from this power plant have also historically provided a reliable source of revenue 
in addition to the electricity used by our monaca facility  we use a combination of coke and natural gas in our smelting and refining processes 
our recycling facilities use a combination of coke  electricity and natural gas 
in  we purchased the majority of our energy under supply contracts  although we also engage in spot purchases 
we purchase all of our coal requirements pursuant to a supply agreement that carries fixed prices through intellectual property we possess proprietary technical expertise and know how related to eaf dust recycling and zinc production  particularly zinc production using recycled feedstocks 
our proprietary know how includes production methods for zinc oxide and micro fine zinc oxides and widely varying customer specifications 
as a major supplier of zinc metal and other zinc based products to industrial and commercial markets  we emphasize developing intellectual property and protecting our rights in our processes 
however  the scope of protection afforded by intellectual property rights  including ours  is often uncertain and involves complex legal and factual issues 
also  there can be no assurance that intellectual property rights will not be infringed or designed around by others 
in addition  we may not elect to 
table of contents pursue an infringer due to the high costs and uncertainties associated with litigation 
further  there can be no assurance that courts will ultimately hold issued intellectual property rights to be valid and enforceable 
competition we believe that we are a unique business  having no direct competitor that recycles similar secondary materials into zinc products in north america 
our primary competitors in the zinc oxide segment include us zinc corporation us zinc  a wholly owned subsidiary of votorantim metals  ltda  and zochem  a wholly owned subsidiary of hudson bay mining and smelting co 
limited  which is an integrated zinc mining company 
us zinc  located in the middle southern states of the united states  is also a zinc recycler 
us zinc is our primary competitor but lacks our integrated processing and smelting capabilities 
zochem s product is sourced through the canadian operations of hudson bay mining and smelting co 
limited 
approximately of the zinc metal consumed in the united states is imported 
therefore  we enjoy a domestic freight and reliability advantage over foreign competitors with respect to us customers 
xstrata plc  which acquired falconbridge in  teck cominco limited and penoles are the primary zinc metal producers in the north american market 
the vast majority of the metal produced by these companies is used by continuous galvanizers in the coating of steel sheet products 
in addition  these producers have mining and smelting operations while we engage only in smelting 
we produce pw zinc metal primarily for use by hot dip galvanizers 
we compete for eaf dust management contracts primarily with the two other domestic recyclers of eaf dust and to a lesser extent with landfill operators 
the domestic recyclers are steel dust recycling and an eaf dust processing facility built by the heritage group 
steel dust recycling commenced operations during the second quarter of and was subsequently acquired in october by zinc nacional  a mexico based recycler 
the heritage group built an eaf dust processing facility in arkansas and began operations in we expect to see new entrants once again explore opportunities in this area when zinc prices are at or near historical high levels 
our proven reliability  expanded processing capacity and customer service have helped us maintain long standing customer relationships 
many of our eaf dust customers have been under contract with us since our predecessor began recycling eaf dust in the s 
in june of  we acquired the eaf dust collection contracts of esoi 
zincox resources plc acquired big river zinc corporation with the stated intention of producing zinc metal from recycled eaf dust sourced from the united states envirosafe and turkey  with initial estimated smelting output from eaf dust of  tons 
they announced the groundbreaking for their recycling plant in ohio in june   however  construction activity was placed on hold pending the development of other projects 
inmetco recycling operations for nickel bearing waste inmetco operates a high temperature metals recovery facility  which utilizes a combination rotary hearth furnace and electric arc smelting furnace to recover nickel  chromium and iron  along with smaller amounts of other metals  from a variety of metal bearing waste materials  generated primarily by the specialty steel industry 
inmetco s main product is a nickel chromium iron ni cr fe remelt alloy ingot that is used as a feedstock to produce stainless and specialty steels 
inmetco also recycles nickel cadmium batteries  producing a cadmium metal product that is reused in the production of nickel cadmium batteries 
the inmetco process for treating ni cr fe metals waste is comprised of feed preparation  blending and pelletizing  thermal reduction and smelting and casting 
the first portion of the inmetco process consists of material preparation  storage  blending  feeding and pelletizing 
inmetco receives the various wastes and pretreats them when necessary to ensure a uniform size of the raw material 
these materials  as well as flue dust and carbon  are pelletized 
pellets are transferred to the rotary hearth furnace rhf for the reduction of some oxidized metal to its metallic form 
reduced pellets are fed to the eaf for production of ni cr fe remelt alloy 
slag discharged from the eaf is processed and sold primarily as road aggregate 

table of contents cadmium recovery the cadmium recovery process was added to the inmetco facility in  with production commencing in this process is operated under a licensing agreement with saft ab 
this process involves the separation of the metal components of ni cd batteries 
the cadmium recovery process involves a basic thermal operation where cadmium or cadmium oxide is processed into high purity cadmium metal 
the cadmium metal is sold primarily back into the ni cd battery industry 
the chart below describes the inmetco flow of operations  beginning with the input of raw materials  continuing through the production processes and indentifying finished products 
flow chart products and services inmetco provides recycling services to its customers under two types of fee arrangements toll processing arrangements and environmental services arrangements 
tolling services under the tolling arrangement  inmetco charges a processing fee per ton of waste received and returns a remelt alloy product based on the waste s metal content and inmetco s historical metal recovery factors for similar waste products 
inmetco serves almost all of the major austenitic stainless steel manufacturers in the united states in its tolling segment 
we believe inmetco is the only recycler of stainless steel wastes in north america and that inmetco s customers rely on its services to promote sustainable business practices  to avoid potential environmental liabilities associated with disposing of hazardous wastes at landfills and to take advantage of the return of valuable metals from their metal bearing waste products 
most of inmetco s tolling customers have signed long term  exclusive contracts  under which inmetco processes their metal bearing wastes 
inmetco receives four main nickel containing waste materials from the specialty steel industry  which support the tolling segment of the business 
these materials are flue dust  mill scale  grinding swarf and pickling filter cakes from spent pickling solution and are received either in a dry form or a wet form containing oil and or water 
furnace baghouse dust or flue dust is generated during the melting and refining steps in the manufacture of stainless steel 

table of contents environmental services under the environmental service fee arrangement  inmetco acquires waste materials and processes those materials with no obligation to return any product to the customer 
depending on the state of the metals markets  inmetco either charges a fee or pays to acquire environmental services materials 
these materials include batteries and specialty steel industry wastes 
batteries include nickel cadmium  nickel metal hydride  sodium nickel chloride and various other nickel based batteries 
inmetco also processes limited quantities of household alkaline  zinc carbon and lithium batteries 
additionally  lithium ion and lead acid batteries are sent to third party recyclers for processing 
specialty steel industry wastes include flue dust  mill scale  grinding swarf and pickling filter cake along with a wide variety of other nickel bearing wastes 
revenues are derived from these materials through the sale of remelt alloy product and cadmium product  as well as scrap sales and brokerage activities 
remelt alloy inmetco sells its remelt alloy product  produced from waste accepted as an environmental service  back to the stainless steel industry 
because the sale of remelt alloy product is based on metals market prices  inmetco s revenues and profits fluctuate with prevailing metal prices 
in addition to the production of the remelt alloy in pound ingot size  inmetco also produces a larger pound ingot on request 
cadmium inmetco produces its cadmium metal in the form of shot or ingots to a specification of at least purity 
inmetco also produces a portion of its product to a grade 
these products are sold on a global basis under the cadmet trademark 
sales and marketing inmetco s marketing team consists of a sales manager and two inside sales assistants 
the marketing team provides in house inmetco seminars in which current applicable regulations regarding storage and treatment of wastes  manifesting and transporting wastes and the recycling process are discussed 
these seminars conclude with a tour of the inmetco facility 
inmetco has also been active in exhibiting or presenting papers at outside seminars and trade shows to promote the capabilities of the business segment 
the marketing team supplements these activities with advertisements in applicable industry publications  as well as on the internet 
customers while inmetco has over customers in total  approximately of its sales are made to its top three customers 
inmetco has had a long term relationship with each of its major customers 
two of inmetco s top three customers have been customers since inmetco commenced operations in the late s and one has been a customer since that customer s startup in the early s 
intellectual property the inmetco process enables the business to treat and reclaim ni cr fe bearing hazardous and non hazardous materials in a low cost  environmentally safe manner 
the inmetco process is recognized by the epa as the best demonstrated available technology for the treatment of steelmaking dust ie  low zinc ko  ko and f designated hazardous waste 
the inmetco process has also been recognized by the epa as the best demonstrated available technology for the treatment of cadmium containing batteries 
competition we believe that our recycling facilities provide an environmentally favorable alternative for disposing of hazardous waste 
since  inmetco has provided a recycling alternative for a wide variety of hazardous waste products produced by the specialty steel industry  including steelmaking dust  mill scale and grinding swarf 
stainless steel producers are faced with the same dust disposal problems as carbon steel producers 
however  the 
table of contents process requirements and economics of stainless steelmaking dust processing are different  since the cost of treating the dust may be substantially offset by the recovery of valuable metals such as nickel  chromium and iron  which are recycled and returned to the specialty steel industry under toll arrangements 
in the metal processing industry  the most commonly used techniques for managing and disposing of hazardous waste are land disposal facilities and recycling facilities such as inmetco s 
we believe the inmetco process offers three key advantages over landfill it is a preferred solution from an environmental and product stewardship perspective  it offers potential cost advantages through the return of valuable metals and it avoids exposure to long term contingent liabilities associated with sending waste to landfill facilities 
accordingly  we expect the inmetco process to continue to remain the alternative of choice for the specialty steel industry 
we believe inmetco is the largest recycler of nickel bearing hazardous waste in the north america 
governmental regulation and environmental issues our facilities and operations are subject to various federal  state and local governmental laws and regulations with respect to the protection of the environment  including regulations relating to air and water quality and solid and hazardous waste management and disposal 
these laws include the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla or superfund  the resource conservation and recovery act rcra  the clean air act caa  the clean water act  and their state equivalents 
we are also subject to various other laws and regulations  including those administered by the department of labor  the federal energy regulatory commission ferc  the surface transportation board and the department of transportation 
we believe that we are in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations  including environmental laws and regulations governing our ongoing operations  and that we have obtained or applied in a timely manner for all material permits and approvals necessary for the operation of our business 
our process modifications have resulted in operations fully utilizing recycled feedstocks 
the use of recycled zinc feedstocks preserves natural resources  precluding the need for mining and land reclamation and thereby operating in a manner consistent with the principles of sustainable development 
our recycling services avoid the potential environmental impacts that are associated with landfilling hazardous wastes 
eaf dust itself is a listed hazardous waste created from the melting of steel scrap in electric arc furnaces by the steel mini mill industry 
our recycling process has been designated by the epa as best demonstrated available technology for the recycling of eaf dust 
we maintain irrevocable letters of credit to address financial assurance requirements for potential future remediation costs and rcra permit termination for several facilities 
financial assurance is required under rcra permit requirements for the ellwood city  pennsylvania and palmerton  pennsylvania facilities 
financial assurance  through an irrevocable letter of credit  is also required for eventual closure of our residual landfill at the monaca  pennsylvania facility 
in bartlesville  oklahoma  we and our predecessor formerly operated a primary zinc processing facility which was closed in the s and subsequently dismantled 
environmental remediation work at this facility was completed in in connection with closing these former facilities under an agreement with the oklahoma department of environmental quality 
we currently manage this facility in accordance with the agreement for certain activities described as post closure care 
we  along with two other responsible parties  provide financial assurance for future post closure care activities at the bartlesville facility 
a reserve on our balance sheet has been established for our share of future costs associated with this matter 
our palmerton property is part of a cercla site that was added to the national priorities list in when the palmerton assets were purchased out of bankruptcy in december  we acquired only those assets  including real property  needed to support the ongoing recycling and metal powders businesses at that location 
we currently hold approximately acres within an area of the approximately  acres owned by hii 
the successor in interest to previous owners has contractually assumed responsibility for historic site contamination and associated remediation and has indemnified us against any liabilities related to the property  including natural resource damages 
exceptions to this indemnity include our obligations under the consent decree described below and non superfund rcra obligations and environmental liabilities resulting from our ongoing operations 

table of contents we inherited certain of hii s environmental liabilities related to our palmerton operations pursuant to a consent decree between hii  the epa and the pennsylvania department of environmental protection padep 
our obligations pursuant to this consent decree included construction of a storage building for calcine kiln feed materials and the removal of historic accumulations of lead concentrate from three buildings 
these obligations are currently being managed to the satisfaction of the regulatory agencies and are reserved for on our balance sheet 
removal of historic accumulations of lead concentrate was completed in during  our ellwood city facility completed installation of a new baghouse complex to control air emissions from its rhf  which were previously controlled by a wet scrubber system 
the rhf baghouse complex was installed in accordance with a consent order assessment co a entered into with padep prior to our acquisition of inmetco 
compliance certification testing of the rhf baghouse installation was conducted and submitted to the state in the later part of the co a was extinguished in upon final approval of compliance certification testing by the padep 
employees as of december   we employed  persons at the following locations 
union salaried hourly contract location personnel personnel expiration monaca pittsburgh n a bartlesville n a beaumont n a calumet palmerton palmerton chestnut ridge railroad rockwood barnwell n a ellwood city total of the hourly employees are covered by a separate union contract that expires on march  the vast majority of our hourly personnel are unionized 
hourly workers receive medical  dental and prescription drug benefits 
we do not have a defined benefit plan for hourly or salaried employees and no company paid medical plan for retirees 
we have a k plan for both our hourly and salaried employees 
our labor contracts provide for a company contribution  and in most cases a company match  which varies from contract to contract 
we believe we have satisfactory relations with our employees

any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business  operating results  financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which we have made forward looking statements in this annual report on form k 
there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that we do not currently consider to be significant that may adversely affect our business  performance or financial condition in the future 
the metals industry is highly cyclical 
fluctuations in the availability of zinc and nickel and in levels of customer demand have historically been severe  and future changes and or fluctuations could cause us to experience lower sales volumes  which would negatively impact our profit margins 
the metals industry is highly cyclical 
the length and magnitude of industry cycles have varied over time and by product but generally reflect changes in macroeconomic conditions  levels of industry capacity and availability of usable raw materials 
the overall levels of demand for our products containing zinc or nickel reflect fluctuations in levels of end user demand  which depend in large part on general macroeconomic conditions in north america and regional economic conditions in our markets 
for example  many of the principal consumers of zinc metal and zinc related products operate in industries such as transportation  construction or general manufacturing  that themselves are heavily dependent on general economic conditions  including the availability of affordable energy sources  employment levels  interest rates  consumer confidence and housing demand 
these cyclical shifts in our 
table of contents customers industries tend to result in significant fluctuations in demand and pricing for our products and services 
as a result  in periods of recession or low economic growth  such as the one we are currently experiencing  metals companies  including ours  have generally tended to under perform compared to other industries 
we generally have high fixed costs  so changes in industry demand that impact our production volume also can significantly impact our profit margins and our overall financial condition 
economic downturns in the national and international economies and a prolonged recession in our principal industry segments have had a negative impact on our operations and on those of our predecessor both recently and in the past  and a continuation or further deterioration of current economic conditions could have a negative impact on our future financial condition or results of operations 
current or future credit and financial market conditions could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations in several ways 
financial markets in the united states  europe and asia have experienced extreme disruption  including  among other things  extreme volatility in securities prices  severely diminished liquidity and credit availability  rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others 
despite some improvement in credit and financial markets  there can be no assurance that there will not be further deterioration in these markets and confidence in economic conditions 
these economic developments affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways 
tightening of credit in financial markets may delay or prevent our customers from securing funding adequate to honor their existing contracts with us or to enter into new contracts to purchase our products and could result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products 
our customers may also seek to delay deliveries of our products under existing contracts  which may postpone our ability to recognize revenue on contracts in our order backlog 
our business is also adversely affected by decreases in the general level of economic activity  including the levels of purchasing and investment in general 
strengthening of the rate of exchange for the us dollar against certain major currencies may adversely affect our results or may adversely affect our domestic customers ability to export their product 
we may also face increased risk that the counterparty to a hedging transaction that we enter or have entered into may default on its obligation to pay or deliver under the forward contract 
we are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of disruptions in financial markets and sluggish economic conditions in the united states and other countries  and any resulting effects or changes  including those described above  may have a material and adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
changes in the prices of zinc and nickel will have a significant impact on our operating results and financial condition 
we derive most of our revenue from the sale of zinc and nickel based products 
changes in the market price of zinc and nickel impact the selling prices of our products  and therefore our profitability is significantly affected by decreased zinc and nickel prices 
market prices of these metals are dependent upon supply and demand and a variety of factors over which we have little or no control  including us and world economic conditions  availability and relative pricing of metal substitutes  labor costs  energy prices  environmental laws and regulations  weather  and import and export restrictions 
declines in the price of zinc have had a negative impact on our operations in the past  and future declines could have a negative impact on our future financial condition or results of operations 
in  record low zinc prices  together with high operational and legacy environmental costs and inefficiencies  caused our predecessor  hii  to 
table of contents file for chapter bankruptcy protection 
market conditions beyond our control determine the prices for our products  and the price for any one or more of our products may fall below our production costs  requiring us to either incur short term losses and or idle or permanently shut down production capacity 
market prices for zinc and nickel may decrease  and therefore our operating results may be significantly harmed 
some of our products and services are vulnerable to long term declines in demand due to competing technologies  materials or imports  which would significantly reduce our sales 
our zinc and nickel based products compete with other materials in many of their applications 
for example  our zinc is used by steel fabricators in the hot dip galvanizing process  in which steel is coated with zinc in order to protect it from corrosion 
steel fabricators also can use paint  which we do not sell  for corrosion protection 
demand for our zinc as a galvanizing material may shift depending on how customers view the respective merits of hot dip galvanizing and paint 
in addition  some of our customers may reduce or eliminate their usage of pw grade zinc metal because it contains a small amount of lead and may switch to other grades of zinc metal that we do not produce 
our nickel based products are used in the stainless steel industry 
demand for our products and services may decline if demand for stainless steel lessens 
nickel bearing stainless steel faces competition from stainless steels containing a lower level of nickel or no nickel 
domestic production of stainless steel may be negatively impacted by imports 
in addition  in periods of high zinc and nickel prices  consumers of these metals may have additional incentives to invest in the development of technologically viable substitutes for zinc and nickel based products 
similarly  customers may develop ways to manufacture their products by using less zinc and nickel based material than they do currently 
if one or more of our customers successfully identify alternative products that can be substituted for our zinc or nickel based products  or find ways to reduce their zinc or nickel consumption  our sales to those and other customers would likely decline 
demand for our eaf dust or nickel bearing waste recycling operations may decline to the extent that steel mini mill producers identify less expensive or more convenient alternatives for the disposal of their eaf dust or nickel bearing waste or if the epa were to no longer classify eaf dust as a listed hazardous waste 
we may in the future face increased competition from other eaf dust or nickel bearing waste recyclers  including new entrants into those recycling markets  or from landfills implementing more effective disposal techniques 
furthermore  our current recycling customers may seek to capitalize on the value of the eaf dust or nickel bearing waste produced by their operations  or may seek to recycle their material themselves  or reduce the price they pay to us for the material they deliver to us 
any of these developments would have an adverse effect on our financial results 
we may be unable to compete effectively against manufacturers of zinc and nickel products in one or more of our markets  which would limit our market share and or reduce our sales and our operating profit margins 
we face intense competition from regional  national and global companies in each of the markets we serve  where we face also the potential for future entrants and competitors 
we compete on the basis of product quality  on time delivery performance and price  with price representing a more important factor for our larger customers and for sales of standard zinc products than for smaller customers and customers to whom we sell value added zinc based products 
our competitors include other independent zinc producers as well as vertically integrated zinc companies that mine and produce zinc 
some of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do 
in addition  we estimate that our products comprised only approximately of total zinc consumption in the united states in  and several of our competitors have greater market share than we do 
our competitors may also foresee the course of market development more accurately than we do  sell products at a lower price than we can and or adapt more quickly to new technologies or industry and customer requirements 
we operate in a global marketplace  and zinc metal imports now represent approximately of us zinc metal consumption 
in the future  foreign zinc metal producers may develop new ways of packaging and transporting zinc metal that could mitigate the freight cost and other shipping limitations that we believe currently limit their ability to more 
table of contents fully penetrate the us zinc market 
if our customers in any of the end user markets we serve were to shift their production outside the united states and canada  then those customers would likely source zinc overseas  and  as a result  our net sales and results of operations would be adversely affected 
if we cannot compete other than by reducing prices  we may lose market share and suffer reduced profit margins 
if our competitors lower their prices  it could inhibit our ability to compete for customers with higher value added sales and could lead to a reduction in our sales volumes and profit 
if our product mix changed as a result of competitive pricing  it could have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability 
if we fail to implement our business strategy  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
our ability to achieve our business and financial objectives is subject to a variety of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
for example  factors such as increased competition  legal and regulatory developments  general economic conditions or increased operating costs could prevent us from increasing our capacity  implementing further productivity improvements  investing in technology upgrades or continuing to enhance our business and product mix 
an important part of our strategy is to grow our business by expanding our capacity to process eaf dust 
one new kiln was placed into service in at our rockwood  tennessee facility and two new kilns were placed into service in at our new recycling facility in barnwell  south carolina 
we have also initiated a project to invest in a new  lower cost technology to process eaf dust based feedstock and other recycled materials into special high grade zinc and other zinc products 
we may need additional financing to implement our strategy and we may not have access to the funding required for the investments on acceptable terms 
our construction costs may also increase to levels that would make our facilities unprofitable to operate 
our planned projects may also suffer significant delays or cost overruns as a result of a variety of factors  such as shortages of workers or materials  transportation constraints  adverse weather  unforeseen difficulties or labor issues  any of which could prevent us from completing our expansion plans as currently expected 
our project plans may also result in other unanticipated adverse consequences  such as the diversion of management s attention from our existing operations 
in addition  even if we are able to implement our strategy  projected increases in eaf dust recycling may not materialize to the extent we expect  or at all  resulting in unutilized capacity 
any failure to successfully implement our business strategy  including for any of the above reasons  could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we may  in addition  decide to alter or discontinue certain aspects of our business strategy at any time 
our business could be harmed if we do not successfully manage the integration of businesses that we acquire in the future or we may not realize all or any of the anticipated benefits from acquisitions we make in the future 
as part of our business strategy  we have and may continue to acquire other businesses that complement our core capabilities 
the benefits of an acquisition may often take considerable time to develop and may not be realized 
business acquisitions entail a number of inherent risks such as the potential loss of key customers and employees of the acquired business  the in ability to achieve the operating and financial synergies anticipated from an acquisition  disruptions that can arise from the integration of the acquired business  and potential unknown liabilities or other difficulties associated with the acquired businesses 
as a result of the aforementioned and other risks  we may not realize the anticipated benefits from acquisitions  which could adversely affect our business 

table of contents work stoppages and other labor matters could interrupt our production or increase our costs  either of which would negatively impact our operating results 
as of december   we had  employees   or approximately  of whom were covered by union contracts 
six of the seven collective bargaining agreements to which we are a party are scheduled to expire in we may be unable to resolve any of these contract negotiations without work stoppages or significant increases in costs  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  cash flows and operating results 
we may be unable to maintain satisfactory relationships with our employees and their unions  and we may encounter strikes  further unionization efforts or other types of conflicts with labor unions or our employees  which may interfere with our production or increase our costs  either of which would negatively impact our operating results 
equipment or power failures  delays in deliveries or catastrophic loss at any of our facilities  such as experienced in the explosion at our monaca  pennsylvania facility that occurred on july   could prevent us from meeting customer demand  reduce our sales  increase our costs and or negatively impact our results of operations 
an interruption in production or service capabilities at any of our production facilities as a result of equipment or power failure or other reasons could limit our ability to deliver products to our customers  reducing our net sales and net income  increasing our costs and potentially damaging relationships with our customers 
any significant delay in deliveries to our customers could lead to increased returns or cancellations  damage to our reputation and or permanent loss of customers 
any such production stoppage or delay could also require us to make unplanned capital expenditures  which together with reduced sales and increased costs  could adversely affect our results or operations 
for instance  in july  we experienced an explosion at our monaca  pennsylvania facility that resulted in two fatalities and injuries to at least two employees 
it was determined that each of the ten columns used to produce zinc oxide and refined zinc metal needed to be rebuilt before production could be restarted using these columns  and we were unable to commence reconstruction for several weeks pending completion of various regulatory and other investigations 
consequently  during we lost approximately  tons of zinc production  incurred million in increased costs related to the incident and estimate that our profit in was decreased by million excluding the amounts of any insurance recovery 
furthermore  because many of our customers are  to varying degrees  dependent on deliveries from our facilities  customers that have to reschedule their own production due to our missed deliveries could pursue financial claims against us 
our facilities are also subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such as fires  the explosion at our monaca  pennsylvania facility  adverse weather conditions or other events 
we have experienced  and may experience in the future  periods of reduced production as a result of repairs that are necessary to our kiln  smelting and refinery operations 
if any of these events occur in the future  they could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our insurance policies may not cover all of our losses and we could incur uninsured losses and liabilities arising from  among other things  loss of life  physical damage  business interruptions and product liability including losses resulting from the explosion at our monaca  pennsylvania facility 
fluctuations in the cost or availability of electricity  coke  coal and or natural gas would lead to higher manufacturing costs  thereby reducing our margins and limiting our cash flows from operations 
energy is one of our most significant costs  comprising approximately million of our production costs in our processes rely on electricity  coke and natural gas in order to operate  our freight operations depend heavily on the availability of diesel fuel and our monaca power plant uses coal to generate electricity for our operations in that facility 
energy prices  particularly for electricity  natural gas  coal  coke and diesel fuel  have been volatile and have exceed historical averages in recent years 
these fluctuations impact our manufacturing costs and contribute to earnings volatility 
we estimate that a hypothetical increase in electricity  natural gas and coke costs would have reduced our income from operations by approximately million for in addition  in the event of an interruption in the supply of coal to our power plant at our monaca facility  that facility would be 
table of contents required to purchase electricity  which may not be available and would be subject to the same risks related to an increase in electricity costs 
in addition  at most of our facilities we do not maintain sources of secondary power  and therefore any prolonged interruptions in the supply of energy to our facilities could result in lengthy production shutdowns  increased costs associated with restarting production and waste of production in progress 
we have experienced rolling power outages in the past  and any future outages would reduce our production capacity  reducing our net sales and potentially impacting our ability to deliver products to our customers 
if we were to lose order volumes from any of our major customers  our sales could decline significantly and our cash flows may be reduced 
in  our ten largest customers were responsible for of our consolidated sales 
in  three of inmetco s customers provided of its sales 
a loss of order volumes from  or a loss of industry share by  any major customer could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations by lowering sales volumes  increasing costs and lowering profitability 
in addition  several of our customers have become involved in bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings and have defaulted on their obligations to us in recent years 
we may be required to record significant additional reserves for accounts receivable from customers which may have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in addition  approximately by volume of our zinc product shipments in were to customers who do not have long term contractual arrangements with us 
these customers purchase products and services from us on a spot basis and may choose not to continue to purchase our products and services 
the loss of these customers or a significant reduction in their purchase orders could have a negative impact on our sales volume and business 
our operations are subject to numerous federal and state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of our employees  and changes in health and safety regulation could result in significant costs  which would reduce our margins and adversely affect our cash flow from operations 
we are subject to the requirements of the osha  and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers 
in addition  the osha hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees  state and local government authorities and citizens 
we are also subject to federal and state laws regarding operational safety 
costs and liabilities related to worker safety may be incurred and any violation of health and safety laws or regulations could impose substantial costs on us 
possible future developments  including stricter safety laws for workers or others  regulations and enforcement policies and claims for personal injury or property damages resulting from our operations could result in substantial costs and liabilities that could reduce the amount of cash that we would otherwise have to distribute or use to service our indebtedness or further enhance our business 
litigation related to worker safety may result in significant liabilities and limit our profitability 
we may be involved in claims and litigation filed on behalf of persons alleging injuries suffered predominantly because of occupational exposure to substances at our facilities 
it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of these claims and lawsuits due to the unpredictable nature of personal injury litigation 
if these claims and lawsuits  individually or in the aggregate  were finally resolved against us  our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 
we are subject to stringent environmental regulation  which may cause us to incur significant costs and liabilities that could materially harm our operating results 
our business is subject to a variety of environmental regulations and our operations expose us to various potential environmental liabilities 
for example  we recycle eaf dust  which is listed and regulated as a hazardous waste under the epa s solid waste resource conservation and recovery act rcra 
failure to properly process and manage eaf dust could result in significant liability for us  including  among other things  costs for health related claims or for reclamation of hazardous substances in the environment 
in addition  as part of the purchase of assets out of bankruptcy  we inherited responsibility for several environmental issues from our predecessor at our palmerton and bartlesville facilities 
the palmerton issues are cited in a epa and padep consent decree  and 
table of contents the bartlesville issues are covered in a consent agreement with the oklahoma department of environmental quality for rcra cleanup work 
a reserve in the amount of million was established as of december   to cover the cost of construction of a storage building for calcine kiln feed materials at our palmerton facility  and for cleanup costs at our bartlesville  oklahoma facility 
we may also incur costs related to future compliance with air emission regulations including maximum achievable control technology mact rules relating to industrial boilers  future mact regulations relating to the non ferrous secondary metals production category  revised rules related to the national ambient air quality standard naaqs for lead emissions at our monaca facility  the proposed clean air transport rule that focuses on reducing emissions that affect a downwind state s ability to meet naaqs for a variety of pollutants  including nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides  from our monaca power plant and pennsylvania regulations that are more stringent than the federal mact regulations that would apply to mercury emissions from coal combustion at our monaca power plant 
our total cost of environmental compliance at any time depends on a variety of regulatory  technical and factual issues  some of which cannot be anticipated 
additional environmental issues could arise  or laws and regulations could be passed and promulgated  resulting in additional costs  which our reserves may not cover and which could materially harm our operating results 
potential federal climate change legislation or greenhouse gas regulation could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for our products 
over the past two years  congress has considered legislation that would cap and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases ghgs for most industrial sectors  although to date no major climate change bill has been enacted 
in june  the us house of representatives passed the american clean energy security act of  which was introduced by rep 
henry waxman d ca and rep 
edward markey d ma and commonly known as waxman markey 
this bill would have established an economy wide cap and trade system for emissions of ghgs  seeking to reduce them below levels by and below levels by under waxman markey  sources that emit ghgs would have been required to hold an emission allowance or an offset credit for each carbon dioxide equivalent ton of a ghg emitted or produced on site 
broadly  waxman markey and similar regulatory programs would likely have resulted in increased costs associated with the production and combustion of carbon intensive fuels such as coal  oil  refined petroleum products  and gas 
the us senate did not vote on the house passed bill in the last congressional term 
it is possible that similar legislation could be proposed again in the near future 
in addition  the epa has begun regulating ghg emissions under the clean air act in response to the supreme court s decision in massachusetts v 
epa 
in december  epa published its findings that atmospheric concentrations of ghgs endanger public health and welfare pursuant to the clean air act and that ghg emissions from new motor vehicles and new motor vehicle engines are contributing to air pollution endangering public health and welfare pursuant to the clean air act 
although these findings do not by themselves impose any requirements with respect to sources emitting ghgs and contain no specific emission reduction targets  they have resulted in subsequent efforts by epa to regulate ghgs under the clean air act 
following the endangerment finding  the epa conducted several rulemakings that  although currently subject to pending legal challenges  would regulate ghgs from certain stationary sources under the clean air act 
separately  epa has promulgated a series of rulemakings requiring the reporting of ghg emissions 
the adoption and implementation of any regulations imposing reporting obligations on  or limiting emissions of ghgs from  our equipment and operations could require us to incur significant costs to reduce emissions of ghgs associated with our operations 
we believe we are in substantial compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations applicable to our current operations 
however  accidental spills or releases may occur in the course of our operations  and we cannot give any assurance that we will not incur substantial costs and liabilities as a result of such spills or releases  including those relating to claims for damage to property and persons 
moreover  we cannot give any assurance that the passage of more stringent laws or regulations in the future will not have a negative effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents our hedging strategies may fail to protect us from changes in the prices for natural gas  coal and zinc  which could reduce our gross margin and cash flow 
we pursue various hedging strategies  including entering into forward purchase contracts and put options  in order to reduce our exposure to losses from adverse changes in the prices for natural gas  coal and zinc 
our hedging activities vary in scope based upon the level and volatility of natural gas  coal and zinc prices and other changing market conditions 
our hedging activity may fail to protect or could harm our operating results because  among other things hedging can be expensive  particularly during periods of volatile prices  available hedges may not correspond directly with the risks that we are seeking to protect ourselves against  the duration of the hedge may not match the duration of the risk that we are seeking to protect ourselves against  and the counterparty to a hedging transaction may default on its obligation to pay or deliver under the forward contract 
we depend on the service of key individuals  the loss of whom could materially harm our business 
our success will depend  in part  on the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees  none of whom are covered by key person insurance policies 
these individuals possess sales  marketing  engineering  manufacturing  financial and administrative skills that are critical to the operation of our business 
if we lose or suffer an extended interruption in the services of one or more of our executive officers or other key employees  our business  results of operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted 
moreover  the market for qualified individuals may be highly competitive and we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel to succeed members of our management team or other key employees  should the need arise 
we may not be able to protect our intellectual property  particularly our proprietary technology related to the recycling of eaf dust  the smelting of recycled zinc and the processing of nickel bearing materials 
our market share and results of operations could be harmed 
we rely upon proprietary know how and continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position 
our competitors could gain knowledge of our know how or trade secrets  either directly or through one or more of our employees or other third parties 
if one or more of our competitors can use or independently develop such know how or trade secrets  our market share  sales volumes and profit margins could be adversely affected 
we depend on third parties for transportation services  and their failure to deliver raw material to us or finished products to our customers could increase our costs and harm our reputation and operating results 
we rely primarily on third parties for transportation of the products we manufacture  as well as the delivery of eaf dust to our recycling plants and other raw materials  including recycled zinc  to our monaca production facility 
in particular  a substantial portion of the raw materials we use is transported by railroad  which is highly regulated 
if any of our third party transportation providers were to fail to deliver our products in a timely manner  we may be unable to sell those products at full value or at all 
similarly  if any of these providers were to fail to deliver raw materials to us in a timely manner  we may be unable to meet customer demand 
in addition  if any of these third parties were to cease operations or cease doing business with us  we may be unable to replace them at reasonable cost 
any failure of a third party transportation provider to deliver raw materials or finished products in a timely manner could disrupt our operations  harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results

overview our history we are a leading us producer of zinc and nickel based products 
our products are used in a wide variety of applications  including in the galvanizing of fabricated steel products and as components in rubber tires  alkaline batteries  paint  chemicals  pharmaceuticals and as a remelt alloy in the production of stainless steel 
we believe that we are the largest refiner of zinc oxide and pw zinc metal in north america 
we believe we are also the largest north american recycler of eaf dust  a hazardous waste produced by the carbon steel mini mill manufacturing process 
through our inmetco operations  we believe we are also a leading recycler of eaf dust and other nickel bearing waste generated by specialty steel producers and a leading recycler of nickel cadmium ni cd batteries in north america 
we  together with our predecessors  have been operating in the zinc industry for more than years and in the nickel bearing waste industry for more than years 
as a result of the acquisition of inmetco  we now operate as two business segments 
while we vary our raw material inputs  or feedstocks  based on cost and availability  we generally produce our zinc and nickel based products using nearly recycled zinc  including zinc recovered from our eaf dust recycling operations 
we believe that our ability to convert recycled zinc into finished products results in lower feed costs than for smelters that rely primarily on zinc concentrates 
our four eaf dust recycling facilities also generate service fee revenue from steel mini mills by providing a convenient and safe means for recycling their eaf dust in  we began construction of a new eaf dust processing facility located in south carolina 
we placed the first of two kilns into production in april and the second kiln into production in september inmetco provides recycling services  some of which is on a tolling basis  from a single production facility in ellwood city  pennsylvania 
strategic acquisitions and investments in june  we grew our eaf dust collection operations through the purchase of esoi s customer contracts related to its eaf dust collection business 
on december   we purchased all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of inmetco from vale inco americas inc the acquisition of inmetco enhanced our hazardous waste services platform and diversified our range of capabilities and products including the recycling of eaf dust and stainless steel flue dust for the recovery and reuse of a wide range of valuable metals 
it expanded our industrial metals portfolio while leveraging our key strengths in hazardous waste management and high temperature metals recovery 
we recently announced the completion of a preliminary feasibility study to construct a  ton per year zinc plant based on state of the art green technology 
the goals of the proposed plant would be to produce zinc at much lower costs  to significantly reduce air emissions and to provide opportunities for us to serve the broader market for special high grade zinc and the continuous galvanizing market  in addition to our traditional zinc markets 
if our board of directors approves this project and if we secure financing for this project  construction may start before the end of 
table of contents economic conditions and outlook the economy remains relatively weak but continued to slowly improve through our quarterly zinc product shipment levels for continued to improve over the quarterly shipment levels for but continued to lag the quarterly shipment levels for the first three quarters of in march  we started operations of our sixth furnace at our monaca smelter but returned to five furnaces after the explosion that occurred at our zinc oxide refining facility in july of we returned to full capacity at our monaca smelter late in the fourth quarter of and expect to operate our facilities near full capacity during the first quarter of with intermittent outages on some kilns based on inventory levels 
our results  particularly in comparison to  reflect the impact this limited improvement has had on the markets we serve  as well as the impact of the explosion 
factors affecting our operating results market price for zinc and nickel 
since we generate the substantial majority of our net sales from the sale of zinc and nickel based products  our operating results depend heavily on the prevailing market price for zinc and nickel 
our principal raw materials are zinc extracted from recycled eaf dust  for which we receive revenue from the carbon steel mini mill companies  and other zinc bearing secondary materials purchased feedstock or purchased feed that we purchase from third parties 
costs to acquire and recycle eaf dust  which  during  comprised approximately of our raw materials  were not impacted significantly by fluctuations in the market price of zinc on the lme 
however  the cost for the remaining portion of our raw materials is directly impacted by changes in the market price of zinc 
the price of our finished products is impacted directly by changes in the market price of zinc  which can result in rapid and significant changes in our monthly revenues 
zinc prices experienced a period of general decline between and  primarily due to increased exports from china and declines in global zinc consumption 
during  however  zinc prices began to recover  primarily due to increases in global zinc demand  including in china  and to declines in global production due to closed or permanently idled zinc mining and smelting capacity 
zinc prices rose throughout and to a historical high of per pound on december  and fell steadily to per pound on december  for an average of per pound for in  the lme average zinc price fell approximately from the fourth quarter of significantly reduced construction activity and sharply reduced demand for automobiles  particularly in the fourth quarter of  brought on by the global recession caused demand for zinc products to fall faster than production cuts and announced mine closures 
zinc prices strengthened in  reaching a high of per pound on december  for an average of per pound for the increase reflected not only the announced mine closures and production cuts that began in the fourth quarter of and continued into but also increased investor activity in the zinc markets 
monthly average zinc prices in have fluctuated between per pound and per pound  for an average of per pound for the period 
the movement and level of zinc prices reflect the gradual improvement in economic conditions and continued investor activity in the metal markets 
for  lme average nickel prices ranged from per pound to per pound and averaged per pound 
to mitigate the effects of any decrease in the lme average zinc price  we hedged approximately of our expected zinc production in and through the purchase of put options whereby we would receive a minimum price per pound for the quantity hedged 
we paid a total of million for the options and received million in cash as the options settled 
in october  we sold the put options for million resulting in a million gain 
we replaced the options with similar options having a strike price of per pound for a cost of million to mitigate the effects of any further decrease in the lme average zinc price 
in  we purchased put options for having a strike price of per pound at a cost of million 
at the time of the purchase  they represented approximately of our expected sales volume for in  we purchased put options for having a strike price of per pound at a cost of million 
the purchases represent approximately of our expected zinc production for we also sold put options for having a strike price of per pound and received million 
the options we purchased provide that we will receive a minimum of per pound for the quantity hedged and the options we sold provide that the buyer will receive a 
table of contents minimum of per pound for the quantity hedged 
for a further discussion  see results from operating activities in the liquidity and capital resources section 
demand for zinc and nickel based products 
we generate revenue from the sale of zinc metal  zinc oxide  zinc and copper based powders  as well as from the collection and recycling of eaf dust 
for the periods of through mid year  north american consumption of pw zinc metal the grade of zinc metal in which we specialize and zinc oxide the value added zinc based product from which we generate the most net sales on an historical basis had increased 
because of the need to perform additional maintenance on key equipment that was deferred due to our predecessor s financial difficulties  we had not been able to produce at capacity to take full advantage of this consumption increase 
demand for our products and services decreased significantly in the fourth quarter of due to the severe economic slowdown and continued into the first quarter of demand for our products began to increase in the second quarter of and has continued to increase through our production of zinc products for was  tons compared to  tons in and  tons for weekly steel production declined approximately during the fourth quarter of and continued to decline through the first quarter of thereby reducing the amount of eaf dust generated and the demand for our eaf dust recycling services 
steel production began to increase in the second quarter of and continued to increase through the second quarter of but moderated in the third and fourth quarters of despite the increase  steel production remains at reduced levels compared to in response to the sharp decline in  we suspended our recycling operations during the december holiday period and operated them below capacity for a majority of we restarted one of the kilns at our rockwood  tennessee facility in september of as steel production increased and we began processing the additional eaf dust associated with the customer contracts we purchased from esoi in june of we restarted the second kiln at that facility in november of this brought our recycling operations to capacity  excluding our smallest and highest cost facility located in beaumont  texas 
we do not intend to resume recycling operations at that facility and wrote down the assets to net realizable value in the third quarter of we also began operations at the first kiln at our barnwell  south carolina facility in april of and the second kiln in september of the table below illustrates historical sales volumes and revenues for zinc and nickel based products and eaf dust shipments eaf dust receipts revenue ton year ended december  year ended december  tons  in thousands in us dollars product zinc products eaf dust nickel based products cost of sales excluding depreciation and amortization 
our cost of producing zinc products consists principally of purchased feedstock  energy  maintenance and labor costs 
in and  purchased feedstock related costs comprised approximately of our operating costs and are driven by the percentage of purchased feed used in the feed mix  the average lme zinc price and the price we pay for the purchased feed expressed as a percentage of the lme average zinc price 
the remaining of our production costs were conversion related 
a portion of our conversion costs do not change proportionally with changes in production volume 
consequently  as volume changes our conversion cost per ton changes inversely 
the increase in our production volume in caused our conversion cost per ton to decrease accordingly 
other components of cost of sales include transportation costs  as well as other manufacturing expenses 
the main factors that influence our cost of sales as a percentage of net sales are fluctuations in zinc prices  production and shipment volumes  efficiencies  energy costs  our ability to implement cost control measures aimed at improving productivity and our efforts to reduce our conversion costs 
our purchased feedstock is priced at a discount to the lme 

table of contents we value our inventories using the weighted average actual cost method 
under this method  the cost of our purchased feedstock generally takes three to four months to flow through our cost of sales 
in an environment of rapidly declining lme average zinc or nickel prices  our inventory cost can exceed the market value of our finished goods 
a significant lower of cost or market lcm adjustment can result 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded an lcm adjustment of million 
in the first quarter of  we recorded an lcm adjustment of million 
no lcm adjustment was recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses consist of all sales and marketing expenditures  as well as administrative overhead costs  such as salary and benefit costs for sales personnel and administrative staff  expenses related to the use and maintenance of administrative offices  other administrative expenses  including expenses relating to logistics and information systems and legal and accounting expense  and other selling expenses  including travel costs 
salary and benefit costs historically have comprised the largest single component of our selling  general and administrative expenses 
expenses associated with acquisitions are also included 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales historically have been impacted by changes in salary and benefit costs  as well as by changes in sales volumes and selling prices 
explosion at our monaca  pennsylvania facility on july   an explosion occurred at our monaca  pa zinc oxide refining facility which resulted in two fatalities 
the zinc refinery was shut down for repairs and an investigation and assessment of the damage 
teams from osha and the us chemical safety hazard investigation board csb investigated the cause and the circumstances that may have contributed to the occurrence of this incident 
in addition  we and our insurance underwriters conducted our own investigations into the cause and the circumstances that contributed to this incident 
the united steel workers union also participated in the investigations 
each of the ten columns used to produce zinc oxide and refined zinc metal in the refining facility has been redesigned and rebuilt 
production resumed in the fourth quarter 
the smelting facility at the monaca plant was returned to full capacity late in the fourth quarter of although it operated at a reduced rate during the third quarter and much of the fourth quarter  we were able to offset a portion of the lost revenue from zinc oxide with additional zinc metal sales beyond our traditional markets 
we are pursuing recovery of the cost of repairs  lost profit and other losses from our zinc oxide and refined metal  subject to customary deductibles  under our business interruption and property insurance 
we submitted a preliminary claim to our insurer for million 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded insurance income of million consisting of insurance proceeds of million and a receivable in the amount of million based upon preliminary undisputed claims for business interruption  property damage and other expenses associated with the incident 
we are pursuing the amounts in excess of the preliminary undisputed claims and expect to recover all or a portion of it in we also expect to file additional claims in for any loss of zinc oxide business realized during the first half as a result of the incident 
we believe that we will continue to have adequate liquidity to support the business 
trends affecting our business our operating results are and will be influenced by a variety of factors  including lme price of zinc and nickel  changes in cost of energy and fuels  gain and loss of customers  pricing pressures from competitors  including new entrants into the eaf dust or nickel bearing waste recycling markets  increases and decreases in the use of zinc and nickel based products  expansions into new products and expansion of our capacity  which requires us to incur costs prior to generating revenues  
table of contents expenditures required to comply with environmental and other operational regulations  access to credit by customers  and our operational efficiency improvement programs 
we have experienced fluctuations in our sales and operating profits in recent years due to fluctuations in zinc and energy prices 
historically  zinc prices have been extremely volatile  and we expect that volatility to continue 
for example  the lme price of zinc rose from per pound on december  to per pound on december  and fell to as low as per pound on december  in  the lme price of zinc ranged from a low of per pound on february  to a high of per pound on december  the average price was per pound for in  the lme price of zinc ranged from a high of per pound on january  to a low of per pound on june  the average price was per pound for changes in zinc pricing have impacted our sales revenues  since the prices of the products we sell are based primarily on lme zinc prices  and they have impacted our costs of production  since the prices of some of our feedstocks are based on lme zinc prices 
therefore  since a large portion of our sales and a portion of our costs are affected by the lme zinc price  we expect that changing zinc prices will continue to impact our operations and financial results in the future and any significant drop in zinc prices will negatively impact our results of operations 
we employ various hedging instruments in an attempt to reduce the impact of decreases in the selling prices of a portion of our expected production 
energy is one of our most significant costs 
our processes rely on electricity  coke and natural gas in order to operate 
our freight operations depend heavily on the availability of diesel fuel  and our monaca power plant uses coal to generate electricity for our operations in that facility 
energy prices  particularly for electricity  natural gas  coal  coke and diesel fuel  have been volatile in recent years and have exceeded historical averages 
these fluctuations impact our manufacturing costs and contribute to earnings volatility 
the historically high zinc prices from into also made it attractive for new competitors to enter the eaf dust recycling market to compete for dust generated by existing eaf producers as well as anticipated new eaf capacity 
the entry of new competitors could have an adverse impact on our price realization and market share from eaf dust recycling 
for example  steel dust recycling started up its waelz kiln facility located in alabama in and the heritage group built an eaf dust processing facility in arkansas and began operations in our zinc products compete with other materials in many of their applications  and in some cases our customers may shift to new processes or products 
for example  our zinc is used by steel fabricators in the hot dip galvanizing process  in which steel is coated with zinc in order to protect it from corrosion 
demand for our zinc as a galvanizing material may shift depending on how customers view the respective merits of hot dip galvanizing and paint 
our stainless steel customers face competition from producers of material containing lower levels of nickel  which could have an impact on the demand for our nickel based products 
our ability to anticipate shifts in product usage and to produce new products to meet our current and future customers needs will significantly impact our operating results 
we also face intense competition from regional  national and global providers of zinc based products  and the growth of any of those competitors could reduce our market share and negatively impact our operating results 
finally  our business is subject to a wide variety of environmental and other regulations and our operations expose us to a wide variety of potential liabilities 
our total cost of environmental compliance at any time depends on a variety of regulatory  technical and factual issues  some of which cannot be anticipated 
changes in regulations and or our failure to comply with existing regulations can result in significant capital expenditure requirements or penalties 
summary of critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
note b to the audited consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on form k contains a summary of our significant accounting policies 
certain of these accounting polices are described below 

table of contents inventories inventories  which consist primarily of zinc and nickel bearing materials  and supplies and spare parts  are valued at the lower of cost or market using a moving average cost method 
raw materials are purchased  as well as produced from the processing of eaf dust 
supplies and spare parts inventory used in the production process are purchased 
work in process and finished goods inventories are valued based on the costs of raw materials plus applicable conversion costs  including depreciation and overhead costs relating to associated process facilities 
zinc and nickel are traded as commodities on the lme and  accordingly  product inventories are subject to price fluctuations 
when reviewing inventory for the lower of cost or market  we consider the forward prices as quoted on the lme as of the reporting date in determining our estimate of net realizable value to determine if an adjustment is required 
our product revenues are based on the current or prior months lme average price 
the lme average price upon which our product revenue is based has been reasonably correlated with the forward lme prices that we use to make the lower of cost or market adjustments 
financial instruments the following methods are used to estimate the fair value of our financial instruments 
cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  notes payable due within one year  accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their fair value due to the short term nature of these instruments 
our financial swap and financial option instruments are carried at fair value 
we recognize changes in fair value within the consolidated statements of operations as they occur see note s to our audited consolidated financial statements 
we do not purchase  hold or sell derivative financial instruments unless we have an existing asset or obligation or anticipate a future activity that is likely to occur and will expose us to market risk 
we use various strategies to manage our market risk  including the use of derivative instruments to limit  offset or reduce such risk 
derivative financial instruments are used to manage well defined commodity price risks from our primary business activity 
the fair values of derivative instruments are based upon a comparison of our internal valuations to the valuations provided by third party counterparties with whom we have entered into substantially identical derivative contracts 
we also compare their valuations to ensure that there is an acceptable level of consistency among them 
the valuations utilize forward pricing and an implied volatility of the underlying commodity as well as interest rate forwards and are therefore subject to fluctuation based on the movements of the commodity markets 
we are exposed to credit loss in cases where counter parties with which we have entered into derivative transactions are unable to pay us when they owe us funds as a result of agreements with them 
to minimize the risk of such losses  we use highly rated counter parties that meet certain requirements 
we currently do not anticipate that any of our counter parties will default on their obligations to us 
impairment we review the carrying value of our intangible assets and our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
in  we wrote down to net realizable value certain machinery and equipment and supplies inventories by million 
the write down relates primarily to our beaumont  texas recycling facility 
in the third quarter of  we made a decision to proceed with the construction of our barnwell  south carolina kiln project  and we started operations there in the waelz kiln process used at the barnwell facility is a lower cost process than the process that was used at the beaumont facility 
therefore  we do not intend to use the higher cost capacity at the beaumont facility 
we examined our assets at december  and found no events that would suggest any impairment 
we have no goodwill 
in the event we would determine the carrying amounts would not be recovered  an impairment charge would be recorded for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value

consolidated net sales increased million  or  to million for  compared to million for the increase includes a million increase in net sales for horsehead and million in net sales related to inmetco 
net sales relating to horsehead increased million  or  to million for  compared to million for the increase was a result of a million increase in price realization  due primarily to a higher average lme zinc price for versus  a million increase in sales volume reflecting a net increase in shipments and an increase in eaf dust receipts and a million increase in our co product and miscellaneous sales 
our net sales for further exceeded net sales for by million relating to our hedging activity 
we recorded an unfavorable non cash adjustment of million in relating to our hedging activity versus an unfavorable non cash adjustment of million in zinc product shipments were  tons for  or  tons on a zinc contained basis  compared to  tons  or  tons on a zinc contained basis  for the average sales price realization for zinc products on a zinc contained basis  excluding the effects from the non cash mark to market adjustments of our open hedge positions  was per pound for  compared to per pound for the increase reflects the increase in the average lme zinc price for compared to the increase in zinc prices reflects the general economic recovery that began in and continued into  as well as continued investor activity in the metal markets 
net sales of zinc metal increased million  or  to million for  compared to million for the increase was attributable primarily to a million increase in price realization and a million increase in sales volume 
the increase in price realization was attributable to a higher average lme zinc price for versus  partially offset by the effects of a decrease in the average premium to the lme on zinc metal sold for versus the increase in shipment volume reflects the gradual improvement in demand for our products that began in the second quarter of and continued throughout it also reflects our efforts to increase shipments of zinc metal beyond our traditional markets to partially offset the loss of zinc oxide shipments in the third and fourth quarters of resulting from the explosion that occurred in late july at our zinc oxide refining facility in monaca  pennsylvania 
net sales of zinc oxide increased million  or  to million for  compared to million for the increase was attributable to a million increase in price realization partially offset by a million decrease in sales volume 
the increase in price realization reflects the increase of the average lme zinc prices over the past twelve months partially offset by the lag effect of pricing a majority of our zinc oxide shipments on prior months average lme zinc prices 
the discount to the lme on sales of zinc oxide decreased in from the discount realized in the volume decrease reflects the reduced shipment volumes in the third and fourth quarters of as a result of the explosion at our zinc oxide refining facility in monaca  pennsylvania in late july of shipments to our largest tire customers increased in the first two quarters of reflecting the strengthening in the market that began in the second quarter of and continued into however  we were unable to fully capitalize on the improving zinc oxide market in as a result of the explosion 
net sales of zinc and copper based powder increased million  or  to million for  compared to million for the increase was attributable primarily to increases in prices and shipment volumes of our copper based powders 

table of contents revenues from eaf dust recycling increased million  or  to million for  compared to million for increased volumes caused revenues to increase by million 
a decrease in price realization on eaf dust recycling fees for compared to resulted in a decrease in net sales of million 
eaf dust receipts for increased to  tons compared to  tons for  reflecting the increase in volume associated with the purchase of the customer contracts from esoi in june  the startup of our new recycling facility at barnwell  south carolina in and the increase in steel production that began in the second quarter of and continued into according to data from the american iron steel institute  reported steel production for increased from cost of sales excluding depreciation and amortization 
consolidated cost of sales increased million  or  to million for  compared to million for the increase includes a million increase in cost of sales for horsehead and million in cost of sales related to inmetco 
cost of sales for also includes a benefit from business interruption and property damage insurance recoveries totaling million partially offset by additional costs of repairs and clean up totaling million relating to the explosion at our monaca refinery 
as a percentage of consolidated net sales  consolidated cost of sales was for  compared to for cost of sales related to horsehead  excluding the additional costs and insurance recoveries associated with the explosion  increased million  or  to million for  compared to million for as a percentage of net sales related to horsehead excluding the additional insurance and explosion related items  cost of sales was for  compared to for the change in percentage reflects the net effect of changes in the average lme zinc prices on our net sales and cost of sales 
changes in the average lme zinc price are restricted to the purchased feed component of our cost of sales  therefore any changes in the average lme zinc price have a smaller effect on our cost of sales than on our net sales 
the change in percentage also reflects the effect of increased production on our cost per ton 
the cost of zinc material and other products sold increased million  or to million for  compared to million for the increase was primarily the result of a net million increase in shipment volume  a million increase in the cost of products shipped and a million decrease in recycling and other costs 
the increases reflect higher feed costs and higher conversion costs for compared to purchased feed costs increased by million  reflecting both the higher lme average zinc price as well as a slightly increased cost of purchased feeds we pay expressed as a percentage of the lme average zinc price 
the increase in our purchased feed costs also reflects a increase in the number of tons of purchased feed consumed 
the cost of zinc material and other products sold for included property and workers compensation insurance deductibles relating to the explosion at our zinc oxide refining facility in late july our costs for include a million write down of certain machinery and equipment and supplies inventories primarily at our beaumont  texas recycling facility 
our conversion costs were million higher in than in the increase reflects a million increase in energy costs  the majority of which resulted from an increase in the cost of coke  a million increase in labor costs  a million increase in maintenance and supplies costs and the startup of the new recycling facility in barnwell  south carolina 
these increases were driven primarily by higher production levels for as compared to in response to the gradual economic recovery that began late in and continued into the cost of eaf dust services increased million  or  to million for  compared to million for primarily reflecting an increased volume of eaf dust received and an increase in transportation costs 
depreciation and amortization 
consolidated depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or  to million for  compared to million for the increase reflects increased capital expenditures during the twelve months ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million for  compared to million for horsehead related costs decreased million reflecting primarily a decrease in bad debt expense of million and a decrease in legal and professional services of million partially offset by an increase in labor and benefit costs of million 
the 
table of contents decrease in bad debt expense reflects higher bad debt write offs in coupled with bad debt recoveries in the decrease in legal and professional fees reflects legal and professional fees of approximately million included in expenses relating to acquisition activity in selling  general and administrative expenses relating to inmetco were million 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased million to million for  compared to million for the decrease largely reflects a million reduction in expenses related to the credit facility we cancelled in december   partially offset by a million increase in accretion expense associated with the liability we incurred to purchase the esoi eaf dust contracts in june of income tax provision benefit 
our income tax provision was million for  compared to a benefit of million for our effective tax rates for and were and respectively 
net income 
for the reasons stated above  our net income was million for  compared to a net loss of million for year ended december  compared with year ended december  excluding inmetco net sales 
net sales decreased million  or  to million for  compared to million for the decrease was a result of a million decrease in price realization  due primarily to a lower average lme zinc price for versus  a million decrease in sales volume reflecting decreases in shipments across all product lines and a decrease in eaf dust receipts 
our net sales were further decreased by million relating to our hedging activity and by a million decrease in co product and miscellaneous sales 
the million reduction in net sales relating to our hedging positions consisted of an unfavorable adjustment of million for versus a favorable adjustment of million for the favorable adjustment in includes a million gain on the sale of our zinc put options in october the average premium to the lme on zinc products sold for versus declined for both zinc metal and zinc oxide 
zinc product shipments were  tons for  or  tons on a zinc contained basis  compared to  tons  or  tons on a zinc contained basis  for the average sales price realization for zinc products on a zinc contained basis  excluding the effects from the non cash mark to market adjustments of our open hedge positions  was per pound for  compared to per pound for the decrease reflects the sharp decline in the average lme zinc price in from an average high of per pound for march of to an average low of per pound for december of the decline was particularly sharp in the fourth quarter of  where the average lme zinc price declined from per pound for september to the december low of per pound 
the decline was caused by the general economic recession that began in and continued into the average lme zinc price began to recover in to an average high of per pound for december of  however  the average price for was per pound  or below the average lme zinc price for net sales of zinc metal decreased million  or  to million for  compared to million for the decrease was attributable primarily to a million decrease in price realization and a million decrease in sales volume 
the decrease in price realization was attributable to both a lower average lme zinc price for versus and a lower average premium to the lme on zinc products sold for versus the decrease in shipment volume reflects the weakened demand for our products that began in the fourth quarter of and continued throughout net sales of zinc oxide decreased million  or  to million for  compared to million for the decrease was attributable to a million decrease in sales volume and a million decrease in price realization 
the volume decrease was caused primarily by decreased shipments to our largest tire customers reflecting the general slowdown in the market that began in and continued into the decrease in price realization reflects the lower average lme zinc prices for compared to the average lme zinc prices for the average lme zinc prices declined during to an average of per pound for the period 
they began to recover during to an average of per pound for the period 
the movements in the average lme zinc prices are partially offset by the lag effect of pricing a majority of our zinc oxide shipments on prior months average lme zinc prices 
we realized a discount to the lme on sales of zinc 
table of contents oxide in versus a premium in  both reflecting the lag effect and the movements of the average lme zinc prices from the immediately preceding quarters 
net sales of zinc and copper based powder decreased million  or  to million for  compared to million for the decrease was attributable primarily to decreases in prices and shipment volumes of our copper based powders 
revenues from eaf dust recycling decreased million  or  to million for  compared to million for decreased volumes caused revenues to decrease by million 
a decrease in price realization on eaf dust recycling fees for compared to resulted in a decrease in net sales of million 
the decrease reflects  in part  the effects of two temporary items 
the first is an increase in freight allowances to certain customers for freight diversion charges 
these charges were incurred by those customers in shipping their eaf dust greater distances to those of our recycling facilities that had not been temporarily idled during the current economic downturn 
as we resumed operations at our idled facilities  these charges diminished 
the second is related to eaf dust received and processed in april and may of that generated no revenue 
this eaf dust was associated with the purchase of the customer contracts from esoi in june eaf dust receipts for declined to  tons compared to  tons for  reflecting the sharp drop in steel production that began in the fourth quarter of and continued into according to data from the american iron steel institute  reported steel production for declined from cost of sales excluding depreciation 
cost of sales decreased million  or  to million for  compared to million for as a percentage of net sales  cost of sales was for  compared to for the change in percentage reflects the net effect of changes in the average lme zinc prices on our net sales and cost of sales 
changes in the average lme zinc price are restricted to the purchased feed component of our cost of sales  therefore any changes in the average lme zinc price have a smaller effect on our cost of sales than on our net sales 
the change in percentage also reflects the effect of decreased production on our cost per ton 
excluding the effect the hedges had on our net sales  cost of sales would have been and of net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
the cost of zinc material and other products sold decreased million  or  to million for  compared to million for the decrease was primarily the result of a million decrease in shipment volume across all major product lines  a million decrease in the cost of products shipped and an million decrease in recycling and other costs 
the decreases reflect lower feed costs and lower conversion costs for compared to purchased feed costs were reduced by million  reflecting both the lower lme average zinc price as well as the lower price of purchased feeds we pay expressed as a percentage of the lme 
the reduction in our purchased feed costs also reflects a reduction in the number of tons of purchased feed consumed and a reduction in the percentage of purchased feed used in our feed mix 
the cost of zinc material and other products sold for include a million write down of certain machinery and equipment and supplies inventories primarily at our beaumont  texas recycling facility 
our cost of zinc material and other products sold for include a million lcm adjustment relating to a write down of inventory values during the fourth quarter 
our conversion costs were million lower in than in the reduction reflects a million decrease in utility costs  a million reduction in labor costs and a million reduction in maintenance and supplies costs 
these reductions were driven primarily by our cost reduction initiatives along with lower production levels for as compared to in response to the economic slowdown that accelerated in the fourth quarter of and continued into although our conversion costs declined  a portion of them do not change proportionally with changes in volume 
therefore our conversion cost per ton increased as the decline in our production occurred faster than the decline in our conversion costs through the first three quarters of the increase was partially offset in the fourth quarter of as our conversion costs continued to decline compared to those in the fourth quarter of while our production in the fourth quarter of increased relative to the fourth quarter of the cost of eaf dust services increased million  or  to million for  compared to million for primarily reflecting an increase in transportation costs partially offset by a reduced volume of eaf dust received 

table of contents depreciation 
depreciation expense increased million  or  to million for  compared to million for the increase reflects the increased capital expenditures during the twelve months ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million to million for  compared to million for the decrease reflects primarily a reduction in labor and benefit costs of million resulting from a workforce reduction  partially offset by a million increase in legal and professional fees reflecting costs incurred related to acquisition activity in interest expense 
interest expense increased million to million for  compared to million for the increase reflects accretion expense of million associated with the liability we incurred to purchase the esoi eaf dust contracts in june of the increase also reflects higher fees under our credit facility during the second half of the year and the write off of the remaining deferred finance charges associated with our credit facility  which we terminated in december of the facility was originally scheduled to expire in july interest and other income 
interest and other income decreased million for the decrease was attributable primarily to a million decrease in interest earned on excess cash in a lower interest rate environment and a million decrease in scrap sales partially offset by a million decrease in losses related to asset disposals 
income tax benefit provision 
our income tax benefit was million for  compared to a provision for income taxes of million for our effective tax rates were for and for the tax rate for the nine months ended september  was 
the significant increase in rates was primarily the result of recently enacted tax law changes in the fourth quarter of as well as to changes in estimates and corrections to certain deferred tax items 
the changes will allow us to carry back the losses five years versus two years  which reduces the negative impact of losing the domestic production activities deduction benefit in earlier years 
net income loss 
for the reasons stated above  we incurred a net loss of million for  compared to net income of million for liquidity and capital resources we finance our operations  capital expenditures and debt service primarily with funds generated by our operations 
we believe the combination of our cash balance  our cost reduction initiatives  our hedging positions  and our cash generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity and capital requirements for the next twelve months 
our cash is not restricted with the exception of million related to the following three items 
the first is the new markets tax credit nmtc  the second is the financial assurance associated with the esoi customer contracts purchased by us and the third is the collateral for our letters of credit  all of which are described below 
the portion that is unrestricted is available to satisfy our liquidity and capital requirements 
we believe our cash balance is sufficient to satisfy our liquidity and capital requirements for the next twelve months 
we believe we could obtain a new credit facility and reduce our capital requirements  if necessary  to maintain liquidity 
our ability to continue to fund these requirements may be affected by industry factors  including lme zinc prices  and by general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors discussed in this report including the impact on our operating results of the explosion that occurred in july at our monaca  pennsylvania facility 
year ended december  our balance of cash and cash equivalents at december   excluding million of restricted cash  was million  a million increase from the december  balance of million 
cash and cash equivalents are held in three us banks 
in we invested in certificates of deposit and other short term investments 
the funds invested in certificates of deposit on december  matured in january and were invested in a money market demand account and subsequently transferred to our cash account 
we re invested 
table of contents million in a money market demand account in october the funds we had invested in the government money market fund on december  matured in january cash flows from operating activities our operations provided a net million in cash in  reflecting the gradual improvement in the overall economy as well as the generally higher lme average prices of zinc and nickel during the period 
the improving economy and the higher lme average prices for zinc and nickel also contributed to the increase in accounts receivable and inventory during the period 
our investment in working capital was million at december  and million at december  the increase includes million in undisputed claims for business interruption and property damage insurance relating to the explosion at our refinery in monaca  pa 
we received cash payments of million in relating to the claims with the remaining million included in our accounts receivable balance 
the increase in our accounts receivable also reflects higher sales volumes resulting from the strengthening economy and the higher lme average zinc price 
the increase in our inventories primarily reflects cost and volume increases associated with our raw materials  work in process and zinc products finished goods inventories 
the decrease in our prepaid expenses and other current assets reflects the receipt of an million federal tax refund and an unfavorable  non cash fair value adjustment of million on our zinc put options partially offset by an million income tax refund receivable for we entered into put option contracts in and to protect our cash flows from declines in the lme price of zinc 
the options settle monthly 
in  we were entitled to receive the amount  if any  by which the option strike price  set at per pound  exceeded the average lme price of zinc during the preceding month 
during  the average lme zinc price exceeded the strike price  consequently  the options settled with no payment due to us 
the post closing adjustments associated with our purchase of inmetco in december reduced working capital by million during the first quarter of cash flows from investing activities capital expenditures were million for  of which million related to the construction of the two kilns in barnwell  south carolina 
the first kiln commenced operation in mid april of and the second kiln commenced operation in late september of in december  funds totaling million were released from escrow in accordance with the provisions of the nmtc program related to the financing and development of the barnwell site 
the arrangement provided million of nmtc funds to be used for completion of the development of the project site and construction of buildings and other real property 
the funds and the accrued interest thereon are being held in escrow and are being released as the project is completed 
we funded our capital expenditures with cash on hand 
additionally  we made payments totaling million representing the remaining purchase price of inmetco 
cash flows from financing activities cash flows from financing activities include proceeds of million from the exercise of  stock options in the fourth quarter of year ended december  our balance of cash and cash equivalents at december   excluding the million of restricted cash  was million  a million decrease from the december  balance of million 
in december  we purchased million of commercial paper from a major us bank to mitigate the risk associated with the concentration of our cash balance with a single us bank 
in january  we purchased an additional million of commercial paper with a second major us bank 
the commercial paper carried interest rates ranging from to and had various maturity dates through july  a portion was reinvested in new commercial paper with maturity dates through august  with similar interest rates 
the funds were not reinvested in commercial paper as they matured 
the commercial paper was guaranteed by the federal deposit 
table of contents insurance corporation fdic through its temporary liquidity guarantee program tlgp 
the goal of the tlgp is to preserve confidence in the us banking system and to restore liquidity to the credit markets 
the program covered eligible debt issued by financial institutions between october  and june  with the guarantees expiring no later than june  in june  we began purchasing certificates of deposit with maturities ranging from four weeks to thirteen weeks and having interest rates ranging from to 
we purchased them through the certificate of deposit account registration service cdars 
cdars allows a depositor to keep large deposits federally insured by conveniently investing in certificates of deposit in amounts covered by the fdic 
under the program the depositor invests one amount with a financial institution participating in the cdars program 
that financial institution purchases certificates of deposit from other participating financial institutions in amounts covered by the fdic 
as they matured  a portion of the funds were reinvested in certificates of deposit through cdars having similar maturities and interest rates 
the remaining funds were invested in a money market demand account 
as of december   we had million invested in certificates of deposit having four week maturities and an interest rate of and million invested in the money market demand account with an interest rate of 
the certificates of deposit matured in january and the funds were invested in the money market demand account 
in december  we invested million in a liquidity management fund through a us financial institution 
the fund invests in obligations guaranteed by the us treasury only and does not invest in repurchase agreements 
the fund seeks to provide high levels of current income  liquidity and stability of principal 
we expect to continue to invest our cash in secured positions 
in june  we purchased the customer contracts related to the eaf dust collection business of esoi for million 
we expect the cost of the zinc units recovered from the eaf dust under these contracts will be lower than the cost of zinc units we would need to purchase 
as part of the purchase  we obtained a standard agreement from esoi not to compete in the eaf dust collection business for a period of years 
we paid million on the effective date with the balance of the purchase price to be paid in a series of annual fixed and quarterly variable payments through the payments have been discounted using rates of approximately and for the fixed and variable payments  respectively 
at december  the net present value of the payments was approximately million  of which million was recorded as a current liability and million was recorded as a non current liability 
we are required to provide security in the amount of million for the fixed payment stream until december  at which time the amount of the security will be reduced to million 
on july  we placed million into an escrow account to satisfy the requirement 
on june  and again on june   we amended our financing agreement 
the june  amendment enabled us to participate in the nmtc to help us fund our expansion project in barnwell  south carolina 
the june  amendment also increased our borrowing costs and increased the threshold below which we would be required to comply with certain financial covenants under our revolving credit facility the revolver 
the june  amendment primarily reduced the amount of borrowing available to us under the revolver by million  from million to million 
in july  we requested an advance on our revolver which was not honored by the agent  resulting in the lender being in default under our financing agreement 
the default was cured shortly afterward 
on november   the lender voluntarily filed a prepackaged plan of reorganization with the us bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york 
on december  we terminated the financing agreement  which was scheduled to expire on july  we expect the termination to reduce our financing costs in by approximately million in unused line of credit fees and collateral management fees 
we believe that we currently have adequate liquidity based on our expected cash flow and our cash on hand and will be able to obtain a new financing agreement with a revolving credit facility  if necessary 
the letters of credit outstanding under the revolver were cancelled in october and december and replaced with letters of credit in the amount of million 
we issued an additional letter of credit in the amount of million to satisfy the environmental financial assurance requirements we assumed in connection with our purchase of inmetco 
as of december   we had million in letters of credit outstanding that were backed by million in restricted cash 

table of contents on june  we completed a financing arrangement under the nmtc program to help us fund our expansion project in barnwell  south carolina 
the arrangement provides million of nmtc funds in the form of equity and loans to be used for completion of development of the site and construction of buildings and other real property 
the equity portion may be purchased by us at the end of seven years for a nominal amount 
the equity holders are entitled to receive guaranteed annual payments equal to of their investment 
the cash underlying the nmtc equity is currently being held in escrow and will be released upon completion of the project site development  which is anticipated to be in the next twelve months 
the nmtc program is designed to encourage investment in underserved areas and is part of the community renewal tax relief act of cash flows from operating activities our operations used a net million in cash for  reflecting the dramatic economic downturn that began in the fourth quarter of and the overall economic weakness in the lme average price of zinc during was lower than  however it increased during from a low of per pound for december to a high of for december this use of cash by operating activities included the purchase of put options for at a cost of million and the first scheduled annual fixed payment under the esoi acquisition of million 
our investment in working capital at december   excluding the acquisition of inmetco  decreased million  or  from december  the decrease includes decreases in cash and cash equivalents  inventory and deferred income taxes  partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and in prepaid expenses and other current assets 
the decrease in cash and cash equivalents primarily reflects the acquisitions of inmetco and the eaf dust contracts from esoi  capital spending and increases in restricted cash  partially offset by the successful underwritten public offering of our stock in september of the reduction in inventory reflects decreases of and in the cost and volume  respectively  of zinc based purchased feeds inventory and decreases of and in the cost and volume  respectively  of our zinc based work in process inventory 
the cost of our zinc based finished goods inventory declined versus a decline in volume  reflecting lower production and sales volumes for partially offset by the increase in the lme average price of zinc in the increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets consists primarily of a million income tax receivable  partially offset by an unfavorable  non cash fair value adjustment of million on our zinc put options 
we purchased the put options in october of and throughout to protect our cash flows from declines in the lme price of zinc 
the options settle monthly

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of our business  we are exposed to potential losses arising from changes in the prices of zinc  nickel  lead  natural gas and coal 
we have historically used derivative instruments  such as swaps  put options and forward purchase contracts to manage the effect of these changes 
when we use forward contract hedging instruments to reduce our exposure to rising energy prices  we are limited in our ability to take advantage of future reductions in energy prices  because the hedging instruments require us to exercise the hedging instrument at the settlement date regardless of the market price at the time 
we have also used put options to reduce our exposure to future declines in zinc prices 
we have entered into arrangements hedging a portion of our exposure to future changes in the prices of zinc  nickel and lead for   and our risk management policy seeks to meet our overall goal of managing our exposure to market price risk  particularly risks related to changing zinc and nickel prices 
all derivative contracts are held for purposes other than trading and are used primarily to mitigate uncertainty and volatility of expected cash flow and cover underlying exposures 
we are exposed to losses in the event of non performance by the counter parties to the derivative contracts discussed below  as well as any similar contracts we may enter into in future periods 
counter parties are evaluated for creditworthiness and risk assessment both prior to our initiating contract activities and on an ongoing basis

changes in zinc prices will also impact our ability to generate revenue from our eaf recycling operations as well as our ability to procure raw materials 
in addition  we consume substantial amounts of energy in our zinc production and eaf dust recycling operations  and therefore our cost of sales is vulnerable to changes in prevailing energy prices  particularly natural gas  coke and coal
