this discussion includes forward looking statements about the demand for our products and future results 
please refer to the note regarding forward looking statements section of this annual report on form k 
overview the company develops  manufactures and sells marine seismic data acquisition equipment and underwater remotely operated robotic vehicles 
the company s four operating units  each of which is considered to be a separate reportable segment  consist of seismic energy sources  underwater cables and connectors  seismic energy source controllers and underwater robotic vehicles 
refer to note to consolidated financial statements for further information on reportable segments 
the company s products in the three segments dedicated to marine seismic data acquisition equipment seismic energy sources  underwater cables and connectors and seismic energy source controllers share a common economic characteristic sales are generally related to the level of worldwide crude oil and natural gas exploration and development activity  which is based on current and projected crude oil and natural gas prices 
during the last half of calendar year the first six months of the company s fiscal year  the price of crude oil significantly decreased from its record high price levels and worldwide energy demand decreased due to the global economic slowdown 
these factors lowered the demand for marine seismic exploration surveys  and as a result  the demand for the company s marine seismic data acquisition products decreased 
sales of the company s marine seismic data acquisition products decreased in the fiscal year ended june  compared to the fiscal year ended june  and in the fiscal year ended june  compared to the fiscal year ended june  indications of improvement in the marine seismic exploration industry surfaced in the fourth quarter of the company s fiscal year  and the company s sales and net income were its highest quarterly results for fiscal year this improvement continued in the company s fiscal year as aggregate sales and net income for the marine seismic data acquisition segments improved by and  respectively  versus the company s fiscal year  reflecting an increase in the average price of crude oil and a higher level of marine seismic exploration activity 
the fourth quarter results for fiscal year  however  were lower on a quarterly basis than the fourth quarter results for fiscal year  reflecting lower sales of marine seismic data acquisition products 
the company is hopeful that improved sales and earnings for its three marine seismic data acquisition segments in fiscal year will continue in fiscal year this is based on the company s belief that the demand for crude oil and natural gas will increase in the developed countries if those economies generally improve 
the company also anticipates a higher demand for crude oil and natural gas in the emerging countries if those economies continue at their higher growth rates 
therefore  the necessity to discover offshore hydrocarbon reservoirs will increase as reserves in existing fields are depleted 
such increased global energy requirements are anticipated to result in higher levels of marine seismic exploration activity using seismic exploration data acquisition products including the company s products seismic energy sources  underwater cables and connectors and seismic energy source controllers 
there can be no assurance  however  that improved sales and earnings will continue  due to the marine seismic exploration industry s dependency on crude oil price and global economic and political uncertainty 
in addition  any long term impact of the deepwater horizon incident in the gulf of mexico on the marine seismic exploration industry cannot be predicted 
effective january   the company acquired seabotix inc  a developer  manufacturer and seller of underwater remotely operated robotic vehicles 
bolt acquired sbx because it believes that  within its market category  its products have superior qualities and usefulness to customers  including those in the oil and gas industry 
bolt also acquired sbx on the strength of developed technology that  it believes  could result in incremental shareholder value 
sbx generated sales of  and a net loss of  for the six month period ended june  sbx has expended considerable effort and incurred substantial costs in the development of new products  which are now being introduced in the marketplace 
during the six month period ended june   sbx received several orders for these products  some of which were shipped during the fourth quarter of fiscal year and the remainder are currently scheduled for shipment in the first half of fiscal year sbx has significant sales to the defense industry  federal  state and local 
table of contents governmental units  fire and rescue organizations and educational institutions 
budgetary constraints being experienced by these customer groups negatively impacted sbx s performance during fiscal year and are likely to continue to have a negative impact in fiscal year refer to notes and to consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning sbx 
the company s balance sheet remained strong at june  cash and cash equivalents  and working capital were  and  respectively  despite the company s investing and financing activities during the fiscal year ended june  in connection with its acquisition of sbx and its stock repurchase program

the company remained debt free at june  the company follows accounting standards set by the financial accounting standards board fasb  which are referred to as generally accepted accounting principles or gaap  as contained in the fasb accounting standards codification 
liquidity and capital resources as of june   the company believes that current cash and cash equivalent balances and cash flow from operations will be adequate to meet foreseeable operating needs for fiscal year in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company s board of directors authorized and approved a program to repurchase up to  of its common stock through open market and privately negotiated transactions 
pursuant to the terms of the repurchase program  management will determine the timing and amount of any stock repurchase transactions depending on market conditions  share prices  capital availability and other factors 
the company is not obligated to purchase any shares under the repurchase program 
the repurchase program does not have an expiration date and repurchases may be commenced or suspended at any time or from time to time without prior notice 
the repurchase program is structured to conform to the safe harbor provisions of sec rule b as of june   the company had repurchased  of its shares under the repurchase program at an aggregate cost of  the sec declared the company s shelf registration statement on form s  relating to the sale of up to  of equity  debt or other types of securities described in the shelf registration statement  effective on january  the proceeds of the sale of such securities may be used for acquisitions  capital expenditures  repayment of debt the company may incur in the future  working capital and other general corporate purposes 
the specifics of any potential future offering  along with the prices  terms and use of proceeds of any securities offered by the company  will be determined at the time of any applicable offering and will be described in a prospectus supplement at the time of such applicable offering 
the company has no current plans to offer securities under the shelf registration statement 
fiscal year ended june  at june   the company had  in cash and cash equivalents 
this amount is  or lower than the amount of cash and cash equivalents at june  the decrease was due primarily to the company s acquisition of sbx and its stock repurchase program 
for the fiscal year ended june   cash flow provided from operating activities after changes in working capital items was  primarily due to net income adjusted for non cash items  partially offset by higher accounts receivable and inventory and lower current liabilities  excluding acquisition related liabilities 
for the fiscal year ended june   cash used in investing activities was  due to the purchase of sbx  capital expenditures for new and replacement equipment  and other non current assets

the company anticipates that capital expenditures for fiscal year will not exceed  which will be funded from operating cash flow 
these anticipated capital expenditures will relate primarily to new production machinery and equipment for the company s marine seismic data acquisition segments 

table of contents since a relatively small number of customers account for the majority of the company s sales  the consolidated accounts receivable balance at the end of any period tends to be concentrated in a small number of customers

results of operations fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  consolidated sales for the fiscal year ended june  totaled  an increase of  or from the fiscal year ended june  the change in sales by reportable segment was as follows seismic energy sources increased by   underwater cables and connectors increased by   and seismic energy source controllers decreased by  
sales for sbx  which was acquired effective january   were  for the six month period ended june  the increase in net sales reflects an increase in marine seismic exploration activity  and the acquisition of sbx 
the improvement in sales of seismic energy sources and underwater cables and connectors reflects the outfitting of several new seismic vessels with the company s equipment 
consolidated gross profit as a percentage of consolidated sales was for the fiscal year ended june  versus for the fiscal year ended june  the net decrease in the gross profit percentage was caused primarily by sales mix  partially offset by manufacturing efficiencies associated with the sales increase for the three marine seismic data acquisition segments in aggregate 

table of contents research and development r d costs for the fiscal year ended june  increased by  or from the fiscal year ended june  the increase was due to sbx r d relating to the development of new and refinement of existing underwater robotic vehicle products 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased by  or in the fiscal year ended june  from the fiscal year ended june  sg a for the fiscal year ended june  includes sbx  and sbx acquisition costs 
excluding sbx and related acquisition costs  sg a increased by  or  primarily due to higher compensation expenses  partially offset by lower bad debt expense

the above sales decreases are due to lower marine seismic exploration activity caused by the global economic slowdown 
consolidated gross profit as a percentage of consolidated sales was for the fiscal year ended june  unchanged from the fiscal year ended june  despite the decrease in consolidated sales  the consolidated gross profit percentage remained unchanged caused primarily by a reduction in the amount of manufacturing outsourcing  overtime and temporary help as well as sales mix 
in the fiscal year ended june   replacement part sales were a greater proportion of total sales than in the prior year and replacement parts have a larger gross profit margin 
research and development costs for the fiscal year ended june  increased by  or compared to the fiscal year ended june  these costs were primarily for product development 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by  or for the fiscal year ended june  compared to the fiscal year ended june   primarily due to expense reductions in the following areas bad debts  compensation costs  and freight out

the sec has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results  and require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments 
based on this definition  the company s most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  recording of inventory reserves  deferred taxes  and the potential impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
these policies are discussed below 
the company has other key accounting policies  including the establishment of bad debt reserves 
the company believes that these other policies either do not generally require it to make estimates and judgments that are as difficult or as subjective  or are less likely to have a material impact on the company s reported results of operations for a given period 
although the company believes that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable  they are based upon information available at the end of each reporting period and involve inherent risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ significantly from the company s estimates and its estimates could be different using different assumptions or conditions 
refer to note to consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition the company recognizes sales revenue when it is realized and earned 
the company s reported sales revenue is based on meeting the following criteria manufacturing products based on customer specifications  establishing a set sales price with the customer  delivering product to the customer before the close of the reporting period  whereby delivery results in the transfer of ownership risk to the customer  collection of the sales revenue from the customer is reasonably assured  and no contingencies exist 
inventory reserves a significant source of the company s revenue arises from the sale of replacement parts required by customers who have previously purchased products 
as a result  the company maintains a large quantity of parts on hand that may not be sold or used in final assemblies for an extended period of time 
in order to recognize that certain inventory may become obsolete or that the company may have supplies in excess of reasonably supportable sales forecasts  an inventory valuation reserve has been established 
the inventory valuation reserve is a significant estimate made by management based on experience and the exercise of professional judgment 
actual results may differ from this estimate  and the difference could be material 
management establishes the inventory valuation reserve by reviewing the inventory for items that should be reserved in full based on a lack of usage for a specified period of time and for which future demand is not forecasted and establishes an additional reserve for slow moving inventory based on varying percentages of the cost of the items 
the reserve for inventory valuation at june  and june  was  and  respectively 
at june  and june   approximately  and  respectively  of the raw materials and sub assemblies inventory were considered slow moving and subject to a reserve provision equal to all or a portion of the cost 
in certain instances  this inventory has been unsold for more than five years from the date of manufacture or purchase  and in other instances the company has more than a five year supply of inventory on hand based on recent sales volume 
management believes that this inventory is properly valued and appropriately reserved 
even if management s estimate was incorrect  no cash outlay would result since the cash required to manufacture or purchase the older inventory was expended in prior years 

table of contents the inventory valuation reserve is adjusted at the close of each accounting period  as necessary  based on management s estimate of the valuation reserve required 
this estimate is calculated on a consistent basis as determined by the company s inventory valuation policy 
increases to the inventory valuation reserve result in a charge to cost of sales  and decreases to the reserve result in a credit to cost of sales 
the inventory valuation reserve is also decreased when items are scrapped or disposed of 
during the fiscal year ended june   the inventory valuation reserve increased by a net amount of  deferred taxes the company applies an asset and liability approach to accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities  using enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the recoverability of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the company s assessment of whether it is more likely than not that sufficient future taxable income will be generated in the relevant tax jurisdiction to utilize the deferred tax asset 
the company reviews its internal forecasted sales and pre tax earnings estimates to make its assessment about the utilization of deferred tax assets 
in the event the company determines that future taxable income will not be sufficient to utilize the deferred tax asset  a valuation allowance is recorded 
should that assessment change  a charge or a benefit would be recorded in the consolidated statement of income 
the company has concluded that no deferred tax valuation allowance was necessary at june  and june  because future taxable income is believed to be sufficient to utilize any deferred tax asset 
goodwill and other intangible assets impairment testing the company reviews goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
the a g and rts goodwill balances were tested for impairment and the tests indicated no impairment of the goodwill balances at june  and june  the sbx goodwill balance will initially be tested for impairment at december  other intangible assets were reviewed at june  and june  and there were no indicators of impairment 
goodwill and other intangible assets represent approximately and  respectively  of the company s total assets at june  the evaluation of goodwill and other intangible assets impairments are thus significant estimates by management 
even if management s estimates were incorrect  it would not result in a cash outlay because the goodwill and other intangible assets amounts arose out of acquisition accounting 
refer to notes   and to consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning goodwill and other intangible assets 
recent accounting developments in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update no 
asu  business combinations topic  disclosure of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations  which is an amendment to topic of the fasb accounting standards codification 
this amendment provides clarification regarding the acquisition date that should be used for reporting required pro forma financial information disclosures under topic when comparative financial statements are presented 
under asu if a public entity presents comparative financial statements  the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only 
if comparative financial statements are not presented  the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity for the current reporting period as though the business combination had occurred at the beginning of the current annual reporting period 
in addition  asu improves the usefulness of pro forma revenue and earnings disclosures by requiring a description of the nature and amount of material  non recurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination 
asu is effective prospectively for business combinations with an acquisition date on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  since early adoption of asu is allowed  it was adopted in connection with the acquisition of sbx
