a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net earnings  its most directly comparable financial measure as calculated and presented in accordance with gaap  is shown above 
we define adjusted ebitda as net earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  unrealized risk management gains and losses  foreign exchange gains and losses  unrealized inventory impairment writedowns  gains and losses on asset dispositions  asset impairments and other income 
we believe the adjustments for other income  which is comprised primarily of income from an arbitration award granted to us in the fiscal year ended march   are similar in 
table of contents nature to the traditional adjustments to net earnings used to calculate ebitda and adjustment for these items results in an appropriate representation of this financial measure 
adjusted ebitda is used as a supplemental financial measure by our management and by external users of our financial statements such as commercial banks and ratings agencies  to assess the financial performance of our assets  operations and return on capital without regard to financing methods  capital structure or historical cost basis  the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to pay interest on our indebtedness and make distributions to our equity holders  repeatable operating performance that is not distorted by non recurring items or market volatility  and the viability of acquisitions and capital expenditure projects 
the gaap measure most directly comparable to adjusted ebitda is net earnings 
the non gaap financial measure of adjusted ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to net earnings 
adjusted ebitda is not a presentation made in accordance with gaap and has important limitations as an analytical tool 
adjusted ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap 
because adjusted ebitda excludes some  but not all  items that affect net earnings and is defined differently by different companies  our definition of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 
we recognize that the usefulness of adjusted ebitda as an evaluative tool may have certain limitations  including adjusted ebitda does not include interest expense 
because we have borrowed money in order to finance our operations  interest expense is a necessary element of our costs and impacts our ability to generate profits and cash flows 
therefore  any measure that excludes interest expense may have material limitations  adjusted ebitda does not include depreciation and amortization expense 
because we use capital assets  depreciation and amortization expense is a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate profits 
therefore  any measure that excludes depreciation and amortization expense may have material limitations  adjusted ebitda does not include provision for income taxes 
because the payment of income taxes is a necessary element of our costs  any measure that excludes income tax expense may have material limitations  adjusted ebitda does not reflect cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  adjusted ebitda does not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  working capital needs  and adjusted ebitda does not allow us to analyze the effect of certain recurring and non recurring items that materially affect our net earnings or loss 
how we evaluate our operations we generate substantially all of our revenue through long and short term contracts for the storage of natural gas for third party customers and the proprietary optimization of storage capacity that is 
table of contents uncontracted  underutilized or available only on a short term basis 
we evaluate our business on the basis of the following key measures volume and fees derived from ltf contracts  volume and fees derived from stf contracts  volume and margin derived from our proprietary optimization activities  operating  general and administrative expenses  adjusted ebitda  capitalization and leverage  and borrowing base revolver availability and liquidity 
volume and fees derived from ltf contracts we provide multi year  multi cycle storage services to our customers under ltf contracts 
from our inception on may  to march   we utilized an average of approximately of our operated capacity for our ltf strategy 
the volume weighted average life of our ltf contracts at march  was years 
under our ltf contracts  our customers are obligated to pay us monthly reservation fees which are fixed charges owed to us regardless of the actual use by the customer 
when a customer utilizes the capacity that is reserved under these contracts  we also collect a variable fee designed to allow us to recover our variable operating costs 
reservation fees comprise over of the revenue generated under ltf contracts and provide a baseline of revenue in excess of our general and administrative and operating costs 
from inception to march   our ltf contracts generated average revenues  including both reservation and variable fees  of per mcf 
we evaluate both the volume and price of our ltf contracting  which can indicate the effectiveness of our marketing efforts as well as the relative attractiveness of ltf contracts in comparison to our other revenue strategies 
during periods when prices are higher  we will utilize more of our capacity under ltf contracts 
volume and fees derived from stf contracts in addition  we provide short term services for customers under stf contracts 
from inception to march   we utilized an average of approximately of our operated capacity for our stf strategy 
stf contracts typically have terms of less than one year 
under an stf contract  a customer pays a fixed fee to inject a specified quantity of natural gas on a specified date or dates and to store that gas in our storage facilities until withdrawal on a specified future date or dates 
because stf contracts set forth specified future injection or withdrawal dates  we enter into offsetting transactions to capture incremental value as spot and future natural gas prices fluctuate prior to that activity date 
we monitor the volume used for and evaluate the fees generated under our stf contracts 
the fees we are able to generate from our stf contracts reflect market conditions including interest rates and the effectiveness of our marketing efforts 
from inception to march   our stf contracts generated average revenues of per mcf 
the capacity utilized for stf contracts depends on  among other things  the total capacity of our storage facilities that is not being utilized for ltf contracts and the contract rates available for stf contracts 
volume and margin derived from our proprietary optimization activities from inception to march   we utilized an average of approximately of our operated capacity and all of our ngpl capacity for our proprietary optimization strategy 
when market conditions warrant  we enter into economically hedged transactions with available capacity to achieve margins higher than can be obtained from third party contracts 
because we simultaneously hedge our 
table of contents transactions  we are able to determine in advance the minimum margins that will be realized and add incremental margins by re hedging as market conditions change 
at times  if spreads move favorably  such as if winter gas prices fall below forward prices for the following summer  we can further increase margins that have been substantially locked in by choosing to hold inventory into a subsequent period and re hedging the transaction 
this has the result of increasing our cash flow margins and overall profitability  although for accounting purposes the income is deferred into a later period  causing the appearance of cyclicality in our reported revenues and profits 
when evaluating the performance of our optimization business  we focus on our realized optimization margins  excluding the impact of unrealized hedging gains and losses and inventory write downs 
for accounting purposes  our net realized optimization revenues include the impact of unrealized economic hedging gains and losses and inventory write downs  which cause our reported revenues to fluctuate from period to period 
however  because substantially all inventory is economically hedged  any inventory write downs are offset by hedging gains and any unrealized hedging losses are offset by gains when the inventory is sold 
from inception to march   our proprietary optimization business generated average margins of per mcf on a realized basis before unrealized marked to market gains and losses and inventory write downs 
operating expenses our most significant operating expenses are fuel and electricity costs 
these operating expenses vary significantly based upon the amount of gas we inject or withdraw throughout the year and the price of the energy commodity at the time of purchase 
variable operating expenses are partially offset by the variable fees we collect from our ltf contracts 
the smaller  fixed component of our operating expenses include salaries and labor  parts and supplies  surface and mineral lease rentals and other general operating costs 
these fixed operating expenses are more stable from year to year but can fluctuate due to unforeseen repairs  equipment malfunctions and overhauls of compressors or engines 
general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses primarily consist of employee compensation  legal  accounting and tax fees and our office lease 
adjusted ebitda we define adjusted ebitda as net earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  unrealized risk management gains and losses  foreign exchange gains and losses  unrealized inventory impairment writedown  gains and losses on asset dispositions  asset impairments and other income 
our adjusted ebitda is not a presentation made in accordance with gaap 
we utilize adjusted ebitda in order to be able to compare our results against our peers  regardless of differences in financing  and by excluding non recurring items to be able to compare to our own results for other periods 
capitalization and leverage we regularly monitor our leverage statistics to ensure a conservative capital structure 
as of march   we had a debt to adjusted ebitda ratio of x  debt to capitalization of  and a fixed charge coverage ratio of x 
we expect to maintain or improve these ratios over time in order to maintain access to available capital markets  a competitive cost of capital and financial flexibility to grow our business and increase our cash distributions 

table of contents borrowing base revolver availability and liquidity funding the purchase of proprietary optimization inventory can consume a significant portion of our available working capital 
in times of higher natural gas prices  holding large inventories of proprietary gas may cause us to consume a substantial portion of our availability under our credit facilities 
we therefore closely monitor the utilization and remaining available capacity under our credit facilities and actively pursue additional stf contracts when we determine it is appropriate to maintain liquidity 
factors that impact our business factors that impact the performance of specific components of our business from period to period include the following market price for ltf contracts the price available in the marketplace when negotiating new or replacement ltf contracts reflects demand and affects the amount of storage capacity utilized for ltf contracts that year  and thus the amount of capacity utilized for stf contracts or proprietary optimization for that year 
we may increase the capacity that we use for ltf contracts at times of higher market prices and demand 
lower market prices for ltf contracts may result from lower seasonal spreads or a more competitive environment for storage services 
gas storage capacity growth capacity added in the prior year or added during a year is expected to generate incremental revenue 
carried inventory when winter gas prices fall below forward prices for the following summer  we may defer the withdrawal of proprietary optimization inventory until the next fiscal year in order to add incremental margin and economic value 
this results in the deferral of realized earnings and cash flow from one fiscal year to the next 
in some cases  we can mitigate the impact of deferred earnings and cash flow by entering into stf contracts that straddle the two fiscal years 
variable costs the variable operating costs of our facilities mostly comprised of costs associated with fuel or electricity for compressor operations are affected by the amount and price of energy used to inject and withdraw gas from our facilities and by the number and timing of gas injections and withdrawals 
for example  if we experience large injections of gas in the early summer instead of a steady rate of injections throughout the summer we would have greater than expected costs in our first quarter and lower than expected costs in our second quarter 
a mild winter could lead to less withdrawals in total  and therefore lower overall variable costs 
these cost variances would be partially offset by similar variances in contract revenues 
carrying costs our cost of capital and the amount of our working capital availability impacts the amount of capacity utilized for proprietary optimization as compared to stf contracts 
a higher cost of capital relative to that of our customers or less availability will generally lead to less volume used for proprietary optimization transactions 
in general  higher carrying costs for us or our customers result in lower margins for us 

table of contents customer usage patterns incremental revenue opportunities in the form of stf or proprietary optimization transactions may arise for us if capacity usage by our ltf customers is underutilized or offset by other ltf customers 
weather weather extremes and variability directly affect our margins 
very mild years tend to reduce revenue generated under our stf and proprietary optimization strategies  while years with very hot summers  very cold winters or a number of significant storms tend to increase the revenue generated under those strategies 
segment information our process for the identification of reportable segments involves examining the nature of services offered  the types of customer contracts entered into and the nature of the economic and regulatory environment 
since our inception  we have operated along functional lines in our commercial  engineering and operations teams for operations in alberta  northern california and the us midcontinent 
all functional lines and facilities offer the same services firm storage contracts  short term firm services and optimization 
all services are delivered using reservoir storage 
we measure profitability consistently along all functional lines based on revenues and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  before unrealized risk management gains and losses 
we have aggregated our functional lines and facilities into one reportable segment as at and for the fiscal years ended march   and information pertaining to our ltf  stf and proprietary optimization revenues is presented in the consolidated and combined statements of earnings and comprehensive income 
all facilities have the same types of customers major companies in the energy industry  industrial  commercial  and local distribution companies and municipal energy consumers 
results of operations fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  the fiscal year ended march  was characterized by an environment of stable natural gas prices and reduced volatility 
these factors combined to reduce seasonal natural gas storage spreads and limited revenue opportunities within our optimization and stf strategies 
notwithstanding these market conditions  we generated million of adjusted ebitda and million of cash available for distribution 
in addition  we continued our organic strategy by expanding our facilities by bcf at a cost of approximately mcf including accrued expenditures and transfers of cushion gas 
revenue 
revenues for the fiscal year ended march  decreased by to million from million for the fiscal year ended march  this decrease was primarily attributable to the following ltf revenues 
ltf revenues for the fiscal year ended march  increased by to million from million for the fiscal year ended march  this increase was primarily attributable to higher reservation fees earned on the renewal or initiation of certain ltf contracts which increased the fee to per mcf for the year ended march  from per mcf for the year ended march  in addition  approximately of ltf revenue is transacted in canadian dollars 
the canadian dollar strengthened approximately in relation to the us dollar during the current fiscal year 

table of contents stf revenues 
stf revenues for the fiscal year ended march  decreased by to million from million for the fiscal year ended march  this decrease was primarily attributable to decline in margins in the fiscal year ended march  to per mcf from per mcf in the fiscal year ended march  the balance relates to a decrease in capacity utilized for stf contracts  from bcf for the fiscal year ended march  to bcf for the fiscal year ended march  as a result of increasing capacity allocated to optimization revenues 
optimization revenues 
net optimization revenue for the fiscal year ended march  decreased by to million from million for the fiscal year ended march  this decrease was primarily attributable to lower margins realized from capacity utilized for proprietary optimization  and was also affected by timing differences relating to the realization of income 
when evaluating the performance of our optimization business  we focus on our realized optimization margins  excluding the impact of unrealized economic hedging gains and losses and inventory write downs 
for financial reporting purposes  our net optimization revenues include the impact of unrealized economic hedging gains and losses and inventory write downs  which cause our reported revenues to fluctuate from period to period 
however  because all inventory is economically hedged  any inventory write downs are offset by hedging gains and any unrealized hedging losses are offset by realized gains from the sale of physical inventory 
the components of optimization revenues are as follows realized optimization revenues 
realized optimization revenues for the fiscal year ended march  decreased by to million from million for the fiscal year ended march  this is primarily attributable to lower margins realized from the optimization strategy 
the average realized margin deteriorated by to per mcf from per mcf 
partially offsetting this was an increase in capacity that was utilized for proprietary optimization activities due to the significant amount of working capital that was available to us following our re financing and ipo  and further aided by low commodity prices that existed during the year ended march  capacity utilized for optimization activities increased by from bcf for the fiscal year ended march  to bcf for the fiscal year ended march  unrealized risk management losses 
unrealized risk management losses for the fiscal year ended march  were million compared to losses of million in the fiscal year ended march  unrealized losses are attributable to prices rising after financial hedges were transacted for the fiscal year ended march  and as all inventory is economically hedged financially  any risk management losses or gains are offset by future gains or losses associated with the sale of proprietary inventory 
earnings before income taxes 
earnings before income taxes for the fiscal year ended march  decreased by to million from million for the fiscal year ended march  this decrease was primarily attributable to the decreased revenue discussed above  plus the following operating expenses 
operating expenses for the fiscal year ended march  increased by to million from million for the fiscal year ended march  this increase was primarily attributable to higher property and pipeline tax costs resulting from an 
table of contents increase in capacity at our storage facilities in conjunction with higher fuel and electricity costs resulting from increased cycling of our facilities in the fiscal year ended march  niska niska predecessor year ended march  in millions general operating costs  including insurance  vehicle leases  safety and training costs salaries and benefits fuel and electricity maintenance total operating expenses general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended march  decreased by to million from million for the fiscal year ended march  this decrease was primarily attributable to lower legal  audit  and tax costs that we incurred in the prior year in relation to our ipo and re financing efforts  offset by higher compensation and other costs associated with hiring incremental staff to support the regulatory requirements of being a public company 
niska niska predecessor year ended march  in millions compensation costs general costs  including office and it costs legal  audit and regulatory costs total general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization for the fiscal year ended march  increased by to million from million for the fiscal year ended march  this increase was primarily attributable to a provision of million to record the impact of cushion gas effectiveness at aeco hub  compared to a provision of million recorded in the fiscal year ended march  the provision for cushion gas is an estimate based on tests of cushion gas effectiveness 
through continued monitoring over a series of withdrawal and injection cycles  management is able to better estimate the extent of effectiveness deterioration 
interest expense 
interest expense for the fiscal year ended march  increased to million from million for the fiscal year ended march  our average outstanding total debt balance increased to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  prior to their termination on march   the interest rates on our previous term debt and revolving credit facilities were floating and the average interest rates applied to our term debt and revolver balances were lower by approximately  in the prior year than in the fiscal year ended march  foreign exchange gains 
foreign exchange gains for the fiscal year ended march  decreased to million from million for the year ended march  foreign exchange gains 
table of contents were realized on the settlement of canadian dollar denominated receivables and payables in an appreciating canadian dollar environment 
net earnings 
net earnings for the fiscal year ended march  increased by to million from million for the fiscal year ended march  this change was primarily attributable to the lower pre tax earnings discussed above  offset by the following income tax expense benefit 
we recorded an income tax benefit of million for the fiscal year ended march  compared to an expense of million for the fiscal year ended march  this change is in part due to a one time expense in the prior period resulting from electing a us tax reporting currency for select canadian entities 
the change is also due to less income being earned in canadian entities during the current period  combined with tax pools obtained from assets purchased  and favorable assessments completed by taxation authorities 
taxes paid in the current year were million  compared to million in the fiscal year ended march  fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  revenue 
revenues for the fiscal year ended march  increased by to million from million for the fiscal year ended march  this increase was primarily attributable to the following ltf revenues 
ltf revenues for the fiscal year ended march  decreased by to million from million for the fiscal year ended march  this decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in fuel and commodity revenue to million for the fiscal year ended march  from million for the fiscal year ended march  due to lower natural gas prices 
there was also a small decrease in the amount of capacity utilized for ltf contracts 
these factors were offset by higher reservation fees earned on ltf contracts which increased by to per mcf for the year ended march  from per mcf for the year ended march  on an aggregate basis  revenue of per mcf was earned during the fiscal year ended march   compared to revenue of per mcf in the fiscal stf revenues 
stf revenues for the fiscal year ended march  increased by to million from million for the fiscal year ended march  this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in capacity utilized for stf contracts  from bcf for the fiscal year ended march  to bcf for the fiscal year ended march  the balance relates to a improvement in margins in the fiscal year ended march  to per mcf from per mcf 
optimization revenues 
net optimization revenue for the fiscal year ended march  increased by to million from million for the fiscal year ended march  this increase was primarily attributable to increased capacity utilized for optimization  and affected by timing differences relating to the realization of income 
when evaluating the performance of our optimization business  we focus on our realized optimization margins  excluding the impact of unrealized hedging gains and losses and inventory write downs 
for accounting purposes  our net optimization revenues include the impact of unrealized hedging gains and losses and inventory write downs  which cause our reported revenues to fluctuate from period to period 
however  because all inventory is economically hedged  any inventory write downs are offset by hedging gains and any unrealized hedging losses are offset by realized gains from the sale of physical inventory 
the components of optimization revenues are as follows realized optimization revenues 
realized optimization revenues for the fiscal year ended march  increased by to million from million for the fiscal year ended march  this is primarily attributable to an increase in capacity that was 
table of contents utilized for proprietary optimization activities due to low commodity prices in the year ended march  capacity utilized for optimization activities increased by from bcf for the fiscal year ended march  to bcf for the fiscal year ended march  also contributing was a lower cost of goods sold related to sales of inventory that was subject to a write down in fiscal creating wider margins to the hedges locked in at higher price levels 
the average realized margin capacity utilized for optimization improved to per mcf from per mcf 
unrealized risk management gains losses 
unrealized risk management losses for the fiscal year ended march  were million compared to a gain of million in the fiscal year ended march  an unrealized loss  as opposed to an unrealized gain for the year ended march   is attributable to prices rising after financial hedges were transacted for the fiscal year ended march  compared to a falling price environment during the same period in fiscal the lower volumes of inventory carried over at the end of the year ended march  and therefore lower volumes being hedged is what caused the magnitude of the unrealized gains losses to be lower than in fiscal as all inventory is economically hedged financially  any risk management losses or gains are offset by future gains or losses associated with the sale of proprietary inventory 
unrealized inventory writedown 
inventory purchased early during the summers of and was written down for both of the fiscal years ended march  and march  when commodity prices retreated below the weighted average cost of the inventory 
these losses were offset by gains from financial hedges that were transacted when the inventory was purchased 
for the fiscal year ended march  this unrealized inventory writedown amounted to million  compared to million for the fiscal year ended march  earnings before income taxes 
earnings before income taxes for the fiscal year ended march  increased by to million from million for the fiscal year ended march  this increase was primarily attributable to the increased revenue discussed above  plus the following operating expenses 
operating expenses for the fiscal year ended march  decreased by to million from million for the fiscal year ended march  this decrease was primarily attributable to lower fuel and electricity costs resulting from lower prices in the fiscal year ended march  general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended march  increased by to million from million for the fiscal year ended march  this increase was primarily attributable to increased compensation costs  including incentive compensation  professional services obtained in connection with the process of preparing for our ipo  hiring of additional employees  refinancing our debt facilities and tax planning 
the increase in legal fees also resulted from the absence of a credit of million recorded in as the result of the settlement of arbitration proceedings 
these increases were partially offset by reduced rent expenses from subletting a portion of the company office space in the fiscal year ended march  depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization for the fiscal year ended march  decreased by to million from million for the fiscal year ended march  this decrease was primarily attributable to a provision recorded in the fiscal year ended march  of million to record the impact of cushion gas effectiveness at aeco hub  compared to a provision of million recorded in the fiscal year ended march  the provision for cushion gas is an estimate based on tests of cushion gas

through continued monitoring over a series of withdrawal and injection cycles  management is able to better estimate the extent of effectiveness deterioration 
interest expense 
interest expense for the fiscal year ended march  decreased by to million from million for the fiscal year ended march  our average outstanding total debt balance increased by to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  the balance of our previous term debt in fiscal averaged million prior to its termination on march   compared to million for the year ended march  the average utilization of our previous working capital revolvers in fiscal increased by to million prior to its termination on march   compared to million for the year ended march  on march   we entered into a million revolving credit facility and we issued million of senior unsecured notes 
prior to their termination on march   the interest rates on our previous term debt and revolving credit facilities were floating and the average interest rates applied to our term debt and revolver balances were lower by approximately  in the fiscal year ended march  than in the fiscal year ended march  foreign exchange gains 
foreign exchange gains for the fiscal year ended march  decreased to million from million for the year ended march  the election by two of our canadian subsidiaries to adopt the us dollar as their functional currency for their canadian tax returns during the fiscal year ended march  eliminated material foreign currency translation gains and losses attributable to deferred income taxes 
foreign exchange gains were realized on the settlement of canadian dollar denominated receivables in an appreciating canadian dollar environment 
net earnings 
net earnings for the fiscal year ended march  decreased by to million from million for the fiscal year ended march  this change was primarily attributable to the higher pre tax earnings discussed above  offset by the following income tax expense benefit 
income tax expense for the fiscal year ended march  increased to million from an income tax benefit of million for the fiscal year ended march  this increase is primarily the result of a one time election which two of our canadian subsidiaries made to adopt the us dollar as their functional currency for canadian tax return filing purposes that had two impacts first  this one time election converted unrealized foreign exchange losses into deferred tax expense and while it does not have a cash tax impact  the election increased deferred tax expense by million 
second  due to uncertainty surrounding the use of some capital losses created by this election  we recorded a valuation allowance which increased deferred taxes again with no cash tax implications by another million 
the other key factor in increased tax expense is that stronger earnings in the last quarter of the year increased expected deferred tax expense by million 
taxes paid in both years were about million 

table of contents seasonality and quarterly fluctuations our business is highly seasonal 
in general  revenue is highest during our third and fourth fiscal quarters october through march  during the peak of the natural gas storage winter withdrawal season  when we typically sell most of our optimization inventory to serve the seasonal demand created by the north american residential market which uses natural gas to heat their homes 
revenue is substantially lower in the first and second quarters april through september  when natural gas prices are generally lower and we shift to the storage injection season and replenish our natural gas inventory 
in  approximately of our revenue was generated in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year 
because we typically purchase natural gas and build inventories in the summer months and hedge sales forward into the winter months  the peak borrowing on our revolving credit facilities are generally highest in the middle of our third fiscal quarter  while our peak accounts receivable collections typically occur in our fourth fiscal quarter 
the following table illustrates the differences in the recognition of revenue associated with our revenue strategies 
year ended march  qtr qtr qtr qtr fiscal in millions ltf revenue stf revenue realized optimization  net total realized revenue realized revenue as a percentage of total realized revenue year ended march  qtr qtr qtr qtr fiscal in millions ltf revenue stf revenue realized optimization  net total realized revenue realized revenue as a percentage of total realized revenue liquidity and capital resources our primary short term liquidity needs are to pay our quarterly distributions  to pay interest and principal payments under our million credit agreement and our senior notes  to fund our operating expenses  and maintenance capital and to pay for the acquisition of proprietary optimization inventory along with associated margin requirements  which we expect to fund through a combination of cash on hand  cash from operations and borrowings under our million credit agreement 
our medium term and long term liquidity needs primarily relate to potential organic expansion opportunities and asset acquisitions 
we expect to finance the cost of any expansion projects and acquisitions from the proceeds of our ipo  borrowings under our existing and possible future credit facilities or a mix of borrowings and additional equity offerings as well as cash on hand and cash from operations 
we anticipate that our primary sources of funds for our long term liquidity needs will be from cash from operations and or debt or equity financings 
we believe that these sources of funds will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future 

table of contents because we intend to distribute substantially all of our available cash  our growth may not be as fast as the growth of businesses that reinvest their available cash to expand ongoing operations 
moreover  our future growth may be slower than our historical growth 
we expect that we will  in large part  rely upon external financing sources  including bank borrowings and issuances of debt and equity interests  to fund our expansion capital expenditures 
to the extent we are unable to finance growth externally  our cash distribution policy could significantly impair our ability to grow 
to the extent we issue additional units in connection with any acquisitions or expansion capital expenditures  the payment of distributions on those additional units may increase the risk that we will be unable to maintain or increase our per unit distribution level  which in turn may affect the available cash that we have to distribute on each unit 
our operating agreement does not limit our ability to issue additional units  including units ranking senior to the common units we offered in our ipo 
the incurrence of additional debt by us or our operating subsidiaries would result in increased interest expense  which in turn may also affect the available cash that we have to distribute to our unitholders 
historical cash flows our cash flows are significantly influenced by our level of natural gas inventory  margin deposits and related forward sale contracts or hedging positions at the end of each accounting period and may fluctuate significantly from period to period 
in addition  our period to period cash flows are heavily influenced by the seasonality of our proprietary optimization activities 
for example  we generally purchase significant quantities of natural gas during the summer months and sell natural gas during the winter months 
the storage of natural gas for our own account can have a material impact on our cash flows from operating activities for the period we pay for and store the natural gas and the subsequent period in which we receive proceeds from the sale of natural gas 
when we purchase and store natural gas for our own account  we use cash to pay for the gas and record the gas as inventory and thereby reduce our cash flows from operating activities 
we typically borrow on our revolving credit facilities to fund these purchases  and these borrowings increase our cash flows from financing activities 
conversely  when we collect the proceeds from the sale of natural gas that we purchased and stored for our own account  the impact on our cash flows from operating activities is positive and the impact on our cash flows from financing activities is negative 
therefore  our cash flows from operating activities fluctuate significantly from period to period as we purchase gas  store it  and then sell it in a later period 
in addition  we have margin requirements on our economically hedged positions 
as the cash deposits we make to satisfy our margin requirements increase and decrease with our volume of derivative positions and changes in commodity prices  our cash flows from operating activities may

the variability in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to varying market conditions that exist during any given fiscal period  which impacts the margins and fees under each of our ltf  stf and optimization activities  and market conditions at the end of any given fiscal period  which impacts our decision to sell significant volumes of inventory or hold them over a fiscal period end and sell them in the next fiscal period if there is the economic incentive to do so  such as to increase the margins from previous optimization transactions 
for a discussion of changes in cash flow resulting from adjustments to reconcile net earnings to net cash provided by operating activities  please refer to the discussion results of operations 

table of contents changes in non cash working capital are broken down further as follows niska niska predecessor year ended march  in millions changes in non cash working capital margin deposits natural gas inventory prepaid expenses accrued receivables deferred revenue accrued liabilities other net changes in non cash working capital for the fiscal year ended march   the price of natural gas for the following summer was higher than the economically hedged price of our inventory 
we thus chose to carry some of our inventory over the year end and re hedged its sale to the following fiscal year 
this had the effect of increasing our aggregate margins and profitability  but deferred some income and operating cash flow from the fiscal year ended march  to the fiscal year ended march  unlike  because we already had a significant opening inventory balance at the beginning of the year  we did not show a significant use of cash for the purposes of purchasing inventory for the period ended march  million of additional margin deposits were provided during the period to provide collateral support for our financial hedges 
for the fiscal year ended march   our facility expansions resulted in an increase in the amount of capacity that we optimized  and  because natural gas prices were higher in the following summer than they were at the end of the prior year  we chose to carry a significant amount of our inventory into the following year 
while we held slightly more inventory at year end compared to march   lower prices offset some of the change in inventory value 
in addition  forward natural gas prices rose after we economically hedged our inventory requiring us to provide incremental margin deposits to cover our unrealized mark to market losses on the financial hedge positions 
working capital 
working capital is defined as the amount by which current assets exceed current liabilities 
our working capital ratio is defined as current assets divided by current liabilities 
our working capital requirements are primarily affected by our level of capital spending for maintenance and expansion activity  but are also impacted by changes in accounts receivable and accounts payable 
these changes are influenced by factors such as credit extended to  and the timing of collections from  our customers 
our working capital is also affected by the relationship between unrealized financial risk management hedges which are marked to market on a monthly basis  the margin deposits required by our brokers for such gains and losses  proprietary inventory which is stored in our facilities and cash used to fund inventory purchases 
as of march   we had net working capital of million working capital ratio of to  representing only a marginal change compared to net working capital of million working capital ratio of to at march  investing activities 
most of the investing activities in each of the fiscal years ended march   and were attributed to expansion capital expenditures at our storage facilities 
these expenditures  as outlined in capital expenditures  have enabled us to increase our effective working gas capacity by bcf during this period 
however  maintenance capital expenditures have 
table of contents been consistently modest  ranging between million and million each year during this same period 
financing activities 
net cash provided used by financing activities consists of debt incurred for the acquisition of assets  periodic optional and mandatory retirements of such debt  advances and repayments made on our previous credit facilities to fund proprietary inventory purchases  contributions of capital from our equity holders to fund expansion capital expenditures and debt retirements and distributions made to our equity holders 
during the fiscal year ending march   we repaid million of our term debt through a combination of cash provided from operations and a million equity infusion from our equity holders 
during the same period  we drew million under our previous credit facilities to fund some of our proprietary inventory purchases 
we also made a million distribution to our equity holders to cover income tax obligations 
during the fiscal year ending march  we drew million from our previous credit facilities to fund proprietary inventory purchases and subsequently repaid million when the inventory was sold later in the year 
during the fiscal year ended march   we issued our senior notes  which provided net proceeds of approximately million after deducting approximately million of fees and expenses 
see our senior notes due approximately million of the net proceeds were used to make a distribution to our equity holders  approximately million of the proceeds were used to repay our previous revolving credit facility and approximately million of the proceeds were used to repay our previous term loan 
in connection with our issuance of senior notes and the repayment of our previous credit facility and term loan  we entered into new senior secured asset based revolving credit facilities  consisting of a us revolving credit facility and a canadian revolving credit facility see our million credit agreement 
during the fiscal year ending march  we received proceeds of million from our ipo in may of  after deducting fees of million 
this was offset by distributions totaling million made to the owners of niska predecessor in connection with our debt and equity offerings  and million related to quarterly distributions made to our unitholders during the period 
in october of and january of  the holders of our predecessor class a units made contributions to the capital of our predecessor totaling approximately million and million  respectively in order to fund capital expenditures 
during the fiscal year ending march   our predecessor made distributions totaling approximately million to its equity holders inclusive of the million distribution made from the proceeds of the senior notes 

table of contents capital expenditures our capital expenditures for the years ended march   and were as follows niska niska predecessor year ended march  capital expenditures in millions maintenance capital expansion capital total cash expenditures non cash working capital related to property  plant and equipment expenditures non cash transfer of natural gas inventory to property  plant and equipment total maintenance capital expenditures are capital expenditures made to replace partially or fully depreciated assets  to maintain the existing operating capacity of our assets and to extend their useful lives 
expansion capital expenditures are made to acquire additional assets to grow our business  to expand and upgrade our facilities and to acquire similar operations or facilities 
under our current plan  we expect to continue to spend between approximately million and million per year for maintenance capital expenditures to maintain the integrity of our storage facilities and ensure the reliable injection  storage and withdrawal of natural gas for our customers 
in the fiscal year ended march   we spent a total of million  excluding million of capital expenditures which were accrued at march  to expand the capacity and services of our facilities 
our senior notes due on march   niska us and niska canada  closed a non public offering of  units  each unit consisting of principal amount of senior notes due of niska us and principal amount of senior notes of niska canada 
the units were sold in an offering exempt from registration under the securities act to qualified institutional investors in reliance on rule a under the securities act and to non us persons in offshore transactions in reliance on regulation s under the securities act 
on february   the securities and exchange commission sec accepted and made effective our exchange offer whereby holders of the current senior notes were permitted to exchange such senior notes for new freely transferable senior notes 
the terms of the new units are identical to the units which are described below  except that the new units are registered under the securities act and generally do not contain restrictions on transfer 
in this report we refer to the senior notes due of niska us and niska canada as the notes or our senior notes 
in this section niska us and niska canada are each referred to individually as an issuer and collectively as the issuers 
the notes are senior unsecured obligations of each issuer  which are effectively junior to that issuer secured obligations  equal in right of payment with all existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness of each issuer  and senior in right of payment to any future subordinated indebtedness of each issuer 
the notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by us and our direct and indirect subsidiaries on a senior unsecured basis  and are effectively junior to each guarantor secured 
table of contents obligations  equal in right of payment with all existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness of each guarantor and senior in right of payment to any future subordinated indebtedness of each guarantor 
interest on our senior notes is payable on march and september of each year they are outstanding 
the notes will mature on march  under the indenture governing our senior notes  we are required to make principal payments prior to the maturity date except upon certain events of default 
in addition  in the event of a change in control or certain asset sales  as those terms are defined in the indenture  we may be required to offer to redeem the notes from our holders 
the indenture governing our senior notes limits our ability to pay distributions in respect of  repurchase or pay dividends on our membership interests or other capital stock or make other restricted payments 
the limitation changes depending on our fixed charge coverage ratio  which is defined as the ratio of our consolidated cash flow to our fixed charges  each as defined in the indenture governing our senior notes  and measured for the preceding four quarters 
if the fixed charge coverage ratio is not less than to  we will be permitted to make restricted payments if the aggregate restricted payments since the date of closing of our ipo  excluding certain types of permitted payments  are less than the sum of a number of items including  most importantly operating surplus defined similarly to the definition in our operating agreement calculated as of the end of our preceding fiscal quarter  and the aggregate net cash proceeds received by us as a capital contribution or from the issuance of equity interests 
if the fixed charge coverage ratio is less than to  we will be permitted to make restricted payments if the aggregate restricted payments since the date of closing of our ipo  excluding certain types of permitted payments  are less than the sum of a number of items including  most importantly million  and the aggregate net cash proceeds received by us as a capital contribution or from the issuance of equity interests 
as of march   the indenture governing our senior notes would have permitted us to distribute approximately million 
the indenture does not prohibit certain types or amounts of restricted payments  including a general basket of million of restricted payments 
the indenture governing our senior notes contains certain other covenants that  among other things  limit our and certain of our subsidiaries ability to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends on  repurchase or make distributions in respect of our capital stock or make other restricted payments  make certain investments  sell  transfer  or otherwise convey certain assets  create liens  consolidate  merge  sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets  and enter into certain transactions with our affiliates 

table of contents the occurrence of events involving us or certain of our subsidiaries may constitute an event of default under the indenture 
such events include failure to pay interest  principal  or the premium on the notes when due  failure to comply with the merger  asset sale or change of control covenants  certain defaults on other indebtedness  and certain insolvency proceedings 
in the case of an event of default  the holders of the notes are entitled to remedies  including the acceleration of payment of the notes by request of the holders of at least in aggregate principal amount of the notes  and any action by the trustee to collect payment of principal  interest or premium in arrears 
prior to march   the issuers may redeem up to of the aggregate principal amount of the notes at a premium  plus accrued and unpaid interest with net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings 
prior to march   the issuers may redeem some or all of the notes at a make whole premium  as set forth in the offering memorandum 
after march   the issuers may redeem some or all of the notes at a premium that will decrease over time until maturity 
our million credit agreement concurrently with the issuance of our senior notes  niska us and the aeco partnership entered into new senior secured asset based revolving credit facilities  consisting of a us revolving credit facility and a canadian revolving credit facility 
references in this report to our new credit facilities or our million credit agreement refer to the credit agreement and credit facilities  respectively  of the aeco partnership and niska us 
these new revolving credit facilities provide for revolving loans and letters of credit in an aggregate principal amount of up to million for each of the us revolving credit facility and the canadian revolving credit facility 
subject to certain conditions  each of the revolving credit facilities may be expanded up to million in additional commitments  and the commitments in each facility may be reallocated on terms and according to procedures to be determined 
loans under the us revolving facility will be denominated in us dollars and loans under the canadian revolving facility may be denominated  at our option  in either us or canadian dollars 
royal bank of canada is acting as administrative agent and collateral agent for the revolving credit facilities 
each revolving credit facility has a four year maturity 
borrowings under our revolving credit facilities are limited to a borrowing base calculated as the sum of specified percentages of eligible cash equivalents  eligible accounts receivable  the net liquidating value of hedge positions in broker accounts  eligible inventory  issued but unused letters of credit  and certain fixed assets minus the amount of any reserves and other priority claims 
borrowings will bear interest at a floating rate  which in the case of us dollar loans can be either libor plus an applicable margin or  at our option  a base rate plus an applicable margin  and in the case of canadian dollar loans can be either the bankers acceptance rate plus an applicable margin or  at our option  a prime rate plus an applicable margin 
the credit agreement provides that we may borrow only up to the lesser of the level of our then current borrowing base and our committed maximum borrowing capacity  which is currently million 
our borrowing base was million as of june  our obligations under our million credit agreement will be guaranteed by us and all of our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries subject to certain exceptions and secured by a lien on substantially all of our and our direct and indirect subsidiaries current and fixed assets subject to certain exceptions 
certain fixed assets will only be required to be part of the collateral to the extent such fixed assets are included in the borrowing base under the respective revolving credit facility 
the aggregate borrowing base under both revolving credit facilities includes million the pp e amount due to a first priority lien on fixed assets granted to the lenders 
the pp e amount will be reduced on a dollar for dollar basis upon the release of fixed assets having a value in excess of million from such liens 

table of contents the following fees are applicable under each revolving credit facility an unused line fee of per annum  based on the unused portion of the respective revolving credit facility  a letter of credit participation fee on the aggregate stated amount of each letter of credit equal to the applicable margin for libor loans or bankers acceptance loans  as applicable  and certain other customary fees and expenses of the lenders and agents 
we will be required to make prepayments under our revolving credit facilities at any time when  and to the extent that  the aggregate amount of the outstanding loans and letters of credit under such revolving credit facility exceeds the lesser of the aggregate amount of commitments in respect of such revolving credit facility and the applicable borrowing base 
our million credit agreement contains customary covenants  including  but not limited to  restrictions on our and our subsidiaries ability to merge and consolidate with other companies  incur indebtedness  grant liens or security interests on assets subject to security interests under the credit agreement  make acquisitions  loans  advances or investments  pay distributions  sell or otherwise transfer assets  optionally prepay or modify terms of any subordinated indebtedness or enter into transactions with affiliates 
our new revolving credit facilities require the maintenance of a fixed charge coverage ratio of to at the end of each fiscal quarter when excess availability under both revolving credit facilities is less than of the aggregate amount of availability under both revolving credit facilities 
such fixed charge coverage ratio will be tested at the end of each quarter until such time as average excess availability exceeds for thirty consecutive days 
our million credit agreement contains limitations on our ability to pay distributions in respect of  repurchase or pay dividends on our membership interests or other capital stock or make other restricted payments 
these limitations are substantially similar to those contained in the indenture governing our senior notes described above  except that the credit agreement does not contain a general basket of million of restricted payments 
as of march   our million credit agreement would have permitted us to distribute approximately million 
our million credit agreement provides that  upon the occurrence of certain events of default  our obligations thereunder may be accelerated and the lending commitments terminated 
such events of default include payment defaults to the lenders  material inaccuracies of representations and warranties  covenant defaults  cross defaults to other material indebtedness  including our senior notes  voluntary and involuntary bankruptcy proceedings  material money judgments  material events relating to pension plans  certain change of control events and other customary events of default 
as of june   we had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facilities and had million in letters of credit issued 
we and our subsidiaries were in compliance with all covenant requirements under our credit facilities at june  
table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes by period the payments due for our estimated contractual obligations as of march  payment due by period total less than year years years more than years in millions long term debt obligations interest on long term debt obligations operating lease obligations leased storage contracts mineral and surface leases purchase obligations total purchase obligations consist of forward physical and financial commitments related to purchases of natural gas 
as we economically hedge substantially all of our natural gas purchases  there are forward sales that offset these commitments that are not included in the above table 
as at march   forward physical and financial sales for all future periods totaled  million 
off balance sheet arrangements in accordance with gaap  there is no carrying value recorded for a credit facility until we borrow from the facility 
in the future we may use off balance sheet arrangements such as undrawn credit facility commitments  including letters of credit  to finance portions of our capital and operating needs

on january   wild goose entered into an operating lease for compression and other equipment related to the development of an expansion project 
the primary term of the operating lease is five years  although there is an early purchase option which wild goose can exercise after three years 
at the end of either term  wild goose can purchase the leased equipment from the operating lease counterparty at fair market value 
the table above indicates all payments required under the primary term of the operating lease 
critical accounting estimates and policies the historical financial statements included elsewhere in this document have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
gaap represents a comprehensive set of accounting and disclosure rules and requirements  the application of which requires management judgments and estimates including  in certain circumstances  choices between acceptable gaap alternatives 
the following is a discussion of our most critical accounting estimates  judgments and uncertainties that are inherent in the application of gaap  including revenue recognition  the valuation of risk management assets and liabilities  inventory and goodwill 
these estimates affect  among other items  valuing identified intangible assets  evaluating impairments of long lived assets  depreciation of cushion gas  establishing estimated useful lives for long lived assets  estimating revenues and expense accruals  assessing income tax expense and the requirement for a valuation allowance against the deferred income tax asset and valuing asset retirement obligations 

table of contents revenue recognition our assessment of each of the four revenue recognition criteria as they relate to our revenue producing activities is as follows persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
our customary practices are to enter into a written contract  executed by both the customer and us 
delivery 
delivery is deemed to have occurred at the time the natural gas is delivered and title is transferred  or in the case of fee based arrangements  when the services are rendered 
to the extent that we retain our inventory  delivery occurs when the inventory is subsequently sold and title is transferred to the third party purchaser 
the fee is fixed or determinable 
we negotiate the fee for our services at the outset of our fee based arrangements 
in these arrangements  the fees are nonrefundable 
the fees are generally due on the th of the month following the delivery or services rendered 
for other arrangements  the amount of revenue is determinable when the sale of the applicable product has been completed upon delivery and transfer of title 
collectability is reasonably assured 
collectability is evaluated on a customer by customer basis 
new and existing customers are subject to a credit review process  which evaluates the customers financial position eg cash position and credit rating and ability to pay 
if collectability is not considered reasonably assured at the outset of an arrangement in accordance with our credit review process  revenue is recognized when the fee is collected 
revenue from our ltf contracts consists of monthly storage fees and fuel and commodity charges for injections and withdrawals 
ltf contract revenue is accrued on a monthly basis in accordance with the terms of the customer contracts 
customer charges for injections and withdrawals are recorded in the month of injection or withdrawal 
stf contract revenue consists of fees for injections and withdrawals  which include fuel and commodity charges 
one half of the fees are earned at the time of injection by the customer and one half of the fees are charged at the time of withdrawal by the customer 
energy trading contracts resulting in the delivery of a commodity where we are the principal in the transaction are recorded as proprietary optimization revenues or purchases at the time of physical delivery 
realized and unrealized gains and losses on financial energy trading contracts are included in proprietary optimization revenue 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document 
fair value of risk management assets and liabilities niska partners uses natural gas derivatives and other financial instruments to manage its exposure to changes in natural gas prices  foreign exchange  and interest rates 
these financial assets and liabilities  which are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis  are included into one of three categories based on a fair value hierarchy 
the fair value of our derivative and risk management contracts are recorded as a component of risk management assets and liabilities  which are classified as current or non current assets or liabilities based upon the anticipated settlement date of the contracts 
the determination of the fair value of these derivative and physical contracts reflects the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
in the determination of fair value  we consider various factors  including closing foreign exchange and over the counter quotations  time value and volatility factors underlying the contracts 
although the fair value of our risk management assets and liabilities may fluctuate  such fluctuations will always be offset 
table of contents by equivalent changes in the value of our physical inventory and purchases 
our policy is for our inventory and purchases always to be economically hedged  within small tolerances permitted under our risk management policies  so we are not exposed economically to the risk of fluctuating commodity prices 
we do not speculate on changes in the price of the commodity  rather we only lock in margins when they are available in the market 
see business our operations proprietary optimization 
for further analysis regarding our sensitivities to fluctuations in the price of natural gas  see management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks commodity price risks 
inventory our inventory is natural gas injected into storage and held for resale 
long term inventory represents non cycling working gas 
we inject non cycling working gas on a temporary basis to increase pressure within the reservoirs to allow us to market higher cycling contracts or previously un saleable gas from an underutilized reservoir that can be sold into the market when we add mechanical compression to the reservoir 
this mechanical compression will allow access to natural gas that was previously required to maintain pressure within the reservoir 
inventory is valued at the lower of average cost and market 
cushion gas effectiveness certain volumes of gas defined as cushion gas are required for maintaining a minimum field pressure 
cushion gas is considered a component of the facility and as such is not amortized because it is expected to ultimately be recovered and sold 
cushion gas is monitored to ensure that it provides effective pressure support 
in the event that gas moves to another area of the reservoir where it does not provide effective pressure support  charges against cushion gas are included in depreciation in an amount equal to the estimated volumes that have migrated 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that long lived assets may not be recoverable or that the remaining useful life may warrant revision 
when such events or circumstances are present  we assess the recoverability of long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered through the expected undiscounted future cash flows 
in the event that the sum of the expected future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset is less than the carrying value of the asset  an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset carrying value over its fair value is recorded 
goodwill and other intangible assets we account for business acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting and accordingly the assets and liabilities of the acquired entities are recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired is attributed to goodwill 
goodwill is not amortized and is re evaluated on an annual basis or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
goodwill is tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate  legal factors  operating performance indicators  competition  sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business or other factors 
the performance of the test involves a two step process 
the first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate 
table of contents carrying values  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these assumptions are dependent on several subjective factors including the timing of future cash flows and future growth rates 
the fair value of our reporting units is determined based on a weighting of multiples of potential earnings approaches which is classified under level fair value measurement under fasb asc the multiples of earnings approach estimates fair value by applying multiples of potential earnings  working gas capacity  and cyclability of similar entities 
results using the multiples of potential earnings and the multiples of gas capacity and cyclability are given equal weighting when determining the valuation using this approach 
the future operating projections are based on consideration of past performance and the projections and assumptions used in our current operating plans and adjusted for market participant assumptions as appropriate 
we then assign a weighting to the multiple or earnings to derive the fair value of the reporting unit 
these types of analyses contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies and industry conditions 
a reduction in volatility and the narrowing of seasonal natural gas storage spreads in the last six months of the fiscal year ended march  compressed short term firm and realized optimization margins compared to those experienced in the prior fiscal year 
if narrow seasonal spreads and low volatility persist for an extended period of time  these conditions could impact the company intermediate and long term forecast of revenues and profitability and  therefore  valuations of goodwill 
intangible assets representing customer contracts are amortized over their useful lives 
these assets are reviewed for impairment as impairment indicators arise 
when such events or circumstances are present  the recoverability of long lived assets is assessed by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered through the expected undiscounted future cash flows 
in the event that the sum of the expected future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset is less than the carrying value of the asset  an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset carrying value over its fair value is recorded 
pipeline rights of way are formal agreements granting rights of way into perpetuity and are not subject to amortization but are subject to an annual impairment test 
income taxes we are not taxable entities 
income taxes on their income are the responsibility of the individual partners and have accordingly not been recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
niska partners has corporate subsidiaries  which are taxable corporations subject to canadian federal and provincial income taxes  which are included in the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes on the canadian corporate subsidiaries are provided based on the asset and liability method  which results in deferred income tax assets and liabilities arising from temporary differences 
temporary differences are differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years 
this method requires the effect of tax rate changes on current and accumulated deferred income taxes to be reflected in the period in which the rate change was enacted 
the asset and liability method also requires that deferred income tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance unless it is more likely than not that the assets will be realized 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements fair value measurement asc effective april   we are required to disclose the fair value information of financial instruments at each interim reporting period 
the disclosures include the relevant carrying value as well as the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value  in addition to transfers into and out of the three levels of the fair value hierarchy described as level  level and level  as well as additional details about movements within level the new standard clarifies the level of disaggregation required and the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
the adoption of this standard did not impact how we account for balances recorded at fair value 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s 
the term market risks refers to the risk of loss arising from changes in commodity prices  currency exchange rates  interest rates  counterparty credit and liquidity 
the disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses  but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses 
this forward looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures 
commodity price risk to mitigate exposure to changes in commodity prices  we enter into purchases and sales of natural gas inventory and concurrently match the volumes in these transactions with offsetting forward contracts or other hedging transactions 
derivative contracts used to manage market risk generally consist of the following forwards and futures are contractual agreements to purchase or sell a specific financial instrument or natural gas at a specified price and date in the future 
we enter into forwards and futures to mitigate the impact of price volatility 
in addition to cash settlement  exchange traded futures may also be settled by physical delivery of natural gas 
swap contracts are agreements between two parties to exchange streams of payments over time according to specified terms 
swap contracts require receipt of payment for the notional quantity of the commodity based on the difference between a fixed price and the market price on the settlement date 
we enter into commodity swaps to mitigate the impact of changes in natural gas prices 
option contracts are contractual agreements to convey the right  but not the obligation  for the purchaser of the option to buy or sell a specific physical or notional amount of a commodity at a fixed price  either at a fixed date or at any time within a specified period 
we may enter into option agreements to mitigate the impact of changes in natural gas prices 
in order to manage our exposure to commodity price fluctuations  our policy is to promptly enter into a forward sale contract or other hedging transaction for every proprietary purchase contract we enter into 
therefore  inventory purchases are matched with forward sales or are otherwise economically hedged so that there are no speculative positions beyond the minimal operational tolerances specified in our risk policy 
at march   bcf of natural gas inventory was economically hedged  representing of our total current inventory 
however  because inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or market  not fair value  if the price of natural gas increased by per mcf the value of that inventory would increase by million  but the fair value or mark to market value of our hedges would decrease by only million  due to bcf of that inventory that was not economically hedged 
conversely  if the price of natural gas declined by per mcf  the value of that inventory would 
table of contents decrease by million while the fair value of our hedges would increase by only million  due to the non economically hedged position 
long term inventory and fuel gas used for operating our facilities are not offset 
total volumes of long term inventory and fuel gas at march  are bcf and bcf  respectively 
although the intent of our risk management strategy is to protect our margins and manage our liquidity risk on related margin deposit requirements  we do not qualify any of our derivatives for hedge accounting 
changes in the fair values of these derivatives receive mark to market treatment in current earnings and result in greater potential for earnings volatility 
this accounting treatment is discussed further under note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements and critical accounting estimates and policies 
currency exchange risk our cash flow relating to our canadian operations is reported in the us dollar equivalent of such amounts measured in canadian dollars 
monetary assets and liabilities of our canadian subsidiaries are translated to us dollars using the applicable exchange rate as of the end of a reporting period 
revenues  expenses and cash flow are translated using the average exchange rate during the reporting period 
because a portion of our canadian business is conducted in canadian dollars  we use certain financial instruments to minimize the risks of changes in the exchange rate 
these instruments include forward swaps or spot swaps buying or selling us dollars 
options may also be used in the future 
all of the financial instruments utilized are placed with large brokers and financial institutions 
at march   we had forward currency exchange contracts for a notional value of million 
the value of the forward currency contracts at march  and was a liability of million  and a liability of million  respectively  and is recorded in derivative assets and derivative liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
these contracts expire on various dates between april  and august  and are for the exchange of million canadian dollars into million us dollars at a weighted average rate of canadian dollars to dollar 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk due to variable interest rates under our million credit agreement 
all such borrowings under our credit facilities bear interest at variable rates 
as of march   we had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facilities 
the credit facilities would currently provide an interest rate on borrowings of assumes libor plus basis points  where libor is approximately 
in the future  we may borrow under fixed rate and variable rate debt instruments that also give rise to interest rate risk 
changes in economic conditions could result in higher interest rates  thereby increasing our interest expense and reducing our funds available for capital investment  operations or distributions to our unitholders 
counterparty credit risk counterparty credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a customer fails to perform its contractual obligations 
we engage in transactions for the purchase and sale of products and services with major companies in the energy industry and with industrial  commercial  residential and municipal energy consumers 
credit risk associated with trade accounts receivable is mitigated by the high percentage of investment grade customers  collateral support of receivables and our ability to take ownership of customer owned natural gas stored in its facilities in the event of non payment 
margin deposits  or letters of credit in lieu of deposits  are required on derivative instruments utilized to manage our counterparty credit risk 
as commodity prices increase or decrease  the fair 
table of contents value of our derivative instruments changes thereby increasing or decreasing our margin deposit requirements 
rising commodity prices or an expectation of rising prices could increase the cash needed to manage our commodity price exposure and thereby increase our liquidity requirements  limit amounts available to us through borrowing and reduce the volume of natural gas we may purchase 
exchange traded futures and options have minimal credit exposure as the exchanges guarantee every contract will be margined on a daily basis 
in the event of any default  our account on the exchange would be absorbed by other clearing members 
because every member posts an initial margin  the exchange can protect the exchange members if or when a clearing member defaults 
liquidity risk liquidity risk is the risk that we will not be able to meet our financial obligations as they become due 
our approach to managing liquidity risk is to contract a substantial part of our facilities to generate constant cash flow and to ensure that they always have sufficient cash and credit facilities to meet their obligations when due  under both normal and stressed conditions  without incurring unacceptable losses or damage to reputation 
fair value measurement the fair values of the derivative instruments are based on quoted market prices obtained from nymex or ice and from various sources such as independent reporting services  industry publications and brokers 
these quotes are compared to the contract price of the instrument  which approximates the gain or loss that would have been realized if the contracts had been closed out at a specified time 
we utilize observable market data when available  or models that utilize observable market data when determining fair value 
risk management policy and practices we have in place risk management practices that are intended to quantify and manage risks facing our business
