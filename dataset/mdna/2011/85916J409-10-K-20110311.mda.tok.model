overview stereotaxis designs  manufactures and markets an advanced cardiology instrument control system for use in a hospital s interventional surgical suite to enhance the treatment of arrhythmias and coronary artery disease 
the niobe system is designed to enable physicians to complete more complex interventional procedures by providing image guided delivery of catheters and guidewires through the blood vessels and chambers of the heart to treatment sites 
this is achieved using externally applied magnetic fields that govern the motion of the working tip of the catheter or guidewire  resulting in improved navigation  efficient procedures and reduced x ray exposure 
the core components of the niobe system have received regulatory clearance in the us  canada  europe  china  and various other countries 
we believe that our niobe system represents a revolutionary technology in the interventional surgical suite  or interventional lab  and has the potential to become the standard of care for a broad range of complex cardiology procedures 
we also believe that our system is the only technology to be commercialized that allows remote  computerized control of catheters and guidewires directly at their working tip 
we also believe that our technology represents an important advance in the ongoing trend toward digital instrumentation in the interventional lab and provides substantial  clinically important improvements and cost efficiencies over manual interventional methods  which require years of physician training and often result in long and unpredictable procedure times and sub optimal therapeutic outcomes 
in addition to the niobe system and its components  stereotaxis also has developed the odyssey enterprise solution which consolidates all lab information enabling doctors to focus on the patient for optimal procedure efficiency 
the system also features a remote viewing and recording capability called odyssey enterprise cinema  which is an innovative solution delivering synchronized content for optimized workflow  advanced care and improved productivity 
this tool includes an archiving capability that allows clinicians to store and replay entire procedures or segments of procedures 
this information can be accessed from locations throughout the hospital local area network and over the global odyssey network providing physicians with a tool for clinical collaboration  remote consultation and training 
the odyssey enterprise solution may be acquired in conjunction with a niobe system or on a stand alone basis for installation in interventional labs and other locations where clinicians often desire the benefits of odyssey that we believe can improve clinical workflows and related efficiencies 

table of contents in the mid s  we began focusing on developing applications for our technology to treat cardiovascular diseases because of the significant market opportunities for these applications 
during  following receipt of marketing clearance from the fda for our current system  we emerged from the development stage and began to generate revenue from the placement of investigational systems and the commercial launch of our cardiology system in the us and europe 
in december we completed two concurrent registered direct offerings of our common stock 
in one of the offerings  affiliates of two members of our board of directors the lenders purchased a total of  shares of our common stock at per share including warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at per share exercisable through june in the other offering  we sold  shares of our common stock at per share including series a warrants to purchase an additional  shares of our common stock at per share exercisable through june  series b warrants to purchase an additional  shares of our common stock at per share with an expiration date in june  and series c and d warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of  shares of our common stock which were exercisable under certain defined conditions at an exercise price of per share through may the investors in this transaction became entitled to exercise and did exercise  all of their series c warrants to purchase  shares of common stock in march and  of their series d warrants in may  the balance of the series d warrants  for  shares  went unexercised 
the series a warrants to purchase  shares had an anti dilution protection that was triggered in february  reducing the exercise price to per share 
the series b warrants expired unexercised 
in conjunction with these transactions  we received approximately million in net proceeds after deducting offering expenses 
in august we filed a universal shelf registration statement for the issuance and sale from time to time to the public of up to million in securities  including debt  preferred stock  common stock  and warrants 
the registration statement was declared effective by the sec in september in october we completed a public offering of our common stock in which we issued  shares at per share and realized approximately million in proceeds  net of fees and expenses 
in november we completed a public offering of our common stock in which we issued  shares at per share and realized approximately million in proceeds  net of fees and expenses 
we generate revenue from both the initial capital sales of the niobe and odyssey systems as well as recurring revenue from the sale of our proprietary disposable devices  from ongoing license and service contracts  and from royalties paid to the company on the sale by biosense webster of co partnered catheters 
we market our products to a broad base of hospitals in the united states and internationally as detailed in note to the financial statements 
due to an increase in our installed base and to the introduction and regulatory approval of a broader range of catheters and guidewires for use with the niobe system  recurring revenue has increased from of total revenues in to in and in since our inception  we have generated significant losses 
as of december   we had incurred cumulative net losses of approximately million 
we expect to incur additional losses into as we continue the development and commercialization of our products  conduct our research and development activities and advance new products into clinical development from our existing research programs and fund additional sales and marketing initiatives 
we have alliances with each of siemens ag medical solutions  philips medical systems and biosense webster  inc  through which we integrate our niobe system with market leading digital imaging and d catheter location sensing technology  as well as disposable interventional devices  in order to continue to develop new solutions in the interventional lab 
each of these alliances provides for coordination of our sales and marketing activities with those of our partners 
in addition  siemens is our product distributor in certain countries and has agreed to provide worldwide service for our integrated systems 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosures 
we review our estimates and judgments on an on going basis 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following accounting policies are critical to the judgments and estimates we use in preparing our financial statements 
revenue recognition the company adopted accounting standards update  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements asu in the fourth quarter of  effective as of january  prior to the adoption of this guidance  the company followed previously issued guidance for general accounting principles for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
under this previously issued guidance  we were required to continually evaluate whether we had proper evidence to identify separate units of accounting for deliverables within certain contractual arrangements with customers 
if we were unable to support the determination of vendor specific objective evidence vsoe or third party evidence tpe of fair value on the undelivered element  we could not recognize revenue for the delivered elements 
asu permits management to estimate the selling price of undelivered components of a bundled sale for which it is unable to establish vsoe or tpe 
this requires management to record revenue for certain elements of a transaction even though it might not have delivered other elements of the transaction  for which it was unable to meet the requirements for establishing vsoe or tpe 
the adoption of the new guidance did not materially impact revenue reported in prior periods 
the company believes that the new guidance significantly improves the reporting of these types of transactions to more closely reflect the underlying economic circumstances 
this guidance also prohibits the use of the residual method for allocating revenue to the various elements of a transaction and requires that the revenue be allocated proportionally based on the relative estimated selling prices 
under our revenue recognition policy before and after the adoption of asu  a portion of revenue for most system sales is recognized upon delivery  provided that title has passed  there are no uncertainties regarding acceptance  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the sales price is fixed and determinable  and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
beginning in the quarter ended march   revenue for odyssey tm vision standard hd systems was recognized upon delivery due to the fact that third parties became qualified to perform installations 
however  this change did not have a material impact on revenue recognition for the year ended december  beginning in the quarter ended june   revenue for odyssey vision quad systems was recognized upon delivery due to the fact that third parties became qualified to perform installations 
this change resulted in additional revenue of million and additional gross margin of million during the year ended december  beginning in the quarter ended december   revenue for odyssey enterprise cinema systems was recognized upon delivery due to the fact that third parties became qualified to perform installations 
this change resulted in additional revenue of million and additional million in gross margin 
revenue is recognized for other types of odyssey systems upon completion of installation  since there are no qualified third party installers 
when installation is the responsibility of the customer  revenue from system sales is recognized upon shipment since these arrangements do not include an installation element or right of return privileges 
we may deliver systems to a non hospital site at the customer s request 
we evaluate whether delivery has occurred considering general accounting principles for revenue recognition with respect to bill and hold transactions 
amounts collected prior to satisfying the above revenue recognition criteria are reflected as deferred revenue 
revenue from services and license fees  whether sold individually or as a separate unit of accounting in a multi element 
table of contents arrangement  is deferred and amortized over the service or license fee period  which is typically one year 
revenue from services is derived primarily from the sale of annual product maintenance plans 
we recognize revenue from disposable device sales or accessories upon shipment and establish an appropriate reserve for returns 
the return reserve  which is applicable only to disposable devices  is estimated based on historical experience which is periodically reviewed and updated as necessary 
in the past  changes in estimate have had only a de minimus effect on revenue recognized in the period 
we believe that the estimate is not likely to change significantly in the future 
stock based compensation stock compensation expense  which is a non cash charge  results from stock option and stock appreciation rights grants made to employees  directors and consultants at the fair value of the option granted  and from grants of restricted shares to employees 
the fair value of options and stock appreciation rights granted was determined using the black scholes valuation method which gives consideration to the estimated value of the underlying stock at the date of grant  the exercise price of the option  the expected dividend yield and volatility of the underlying stock  the expected life of the option and the corresponding risk free interest rate 
the fair value of the grants of restricted shares  was determined based on the closing price of our stock on the date of grant 
stock compensation expense for options  stock appreciation rights and for time based restricted share grants is amortized on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the underlying issue  generally over four years except for grants to directors which generally vest over one to two years 
stock compensation expense for performance based restricted shares is amortized on a straight line basis over the anticipated vesting period and is subject to adjustment based on the actual achievement of objectives 
compensation expenses related to option grants to non employees are remeasured quarterly through the vesting date 
compensation expense is recognized only for those options expected to vest  net of estimated forfeitures 
estimates of the expected life of options have been based on the average of the vesting and expiration periods  which is the simplified method under general accounting principles for share based payments 
estimates of volatility and forfeiture rates utilized in calculating stock based compensation have been prepared based on historical data and future expectations 
actual experience to date has been consistent with these estimates 
the amount of compensation expense to be recorded in future periods may increase if we make additional grants of options  stock appreciation rights or restricted shares or if we determine that actual forfeiture rates are less than anticipated 
the amount of expense to be recorded in future periods may decrease if we do not achieve the performance objectives by which certain restricted shares are contingent  if the requisite service periods are not completed or if the actual forfeiture rates are greater than anticipated 
valuation of inventory we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost of our inventory  as determined using the first in  first out fifo method  or its current estimated market value 
we periodically review our physical inventory for excess  obsolete  and potentially impaired items and reserve accordingly 
our reserve estimate for excess and obsolete is based on expected future use 
our reserve estimates have historically been consistent with our actual experience as evidenced by actual sale or disposal of the goods 
deferred income taxes deferred assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
we have established a valuation allowance against the entire amount of our deferred tax assets because we are not able to conclude  due to our history of operating losses  that it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize any portion of the deferred tax assets 

table of contents in assessing whether and to what extent deferred tax assets are realizable  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we consider projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based upon the level of historical taxable losses  limitations imposed by section of the internal revenue code and projections for future losses over periods which the deferred tax assets are deductible  we determined that a valuation allowance of deferred tax assets was appropriate 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and revenue 
revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   an increase of approximately 
revenue from sales of systems decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   a decrease of approximately 
the number of units recognized to revenue was niobe systems and a total of million for odyssey systems during the reporting period compared to niobe systems  and million for odyssey systems during the reporting period 
therefore  the decrease in system revenue was primarily due to a decrease in the number of niobe systems sold  slightly offset by an increase in odyssey sales 
revenue from sales of disposable interventional device royalties  service and accessories increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   an increase of approximately 
this increase was attributable to price increases and a larger base of installed systems

income taxes realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings  the timing and amount of which are uncertain 
accordingly  net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by valuation allowances as of december   and to reflect these uncertainties 
as of december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million of which approximately million will expire between and and approximately million will expire between and as of december   we had state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million which will expire at various dates between and if not utilized 
we may not be able to utilize all of these loss carryforwards prior to their expiration

common stock in december  we completed a registered direct offering in which we issued and sold  units the units at the negotiated price of per unit  with each unit consisting of i one share of the 
table of contents company s common stock  ii one warrant to purchase shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share the series a warrant  for an aggregate of up to  shares of common stock  iii one six month warrant to purchase shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share the series b warrant  for an aggregate of up to  shares of common stock  and iv two warrants to purchase shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share the series c and d warrants  for an aggregate of up to  shares of common stock

in november  we completed a public offering of our common stock in which we issued  shares at per share and realized approximately million in proceeds  net of fees and expenses 
liquidity refers to the liquid financial assets available to fund our business operations and pay for near term obligations 
these liquid financial assets consist of cash and cash equivalents 
the following table summarizes our cash flow by operating  investing and financing activities for each of years ended december   and in thousands cash flow used in operating activities cash flow provided by used in investing activities cash flow provided by financing activities net cash used in operating activities 
we used approximately million  million and million of cash in operating activities during the years ended december   and  respectively  primarily as a result of operating losses during these periods 
the decrease in cash used in operating activities from december  to december  is primarily due to a decrease in the net operating loss and increase in accounts payable  partially offset by share based compensation and an increase in inventory 
net cash provided by used in investing activities 
we used approximately million to fund investing activities during the year ended december  for the purchase of property and equipment 
we used million to fund investing activities during the year ended december  and generated cash from investing activities of million during the year ended december  the cash generated from investing activities was due to the sale of investments partially offset by purchases of property and equipment of million 

table of contents net cash provided by financing activities 
we realized approximately million from financing activities during the year ended december  principally from the sale of our common stock in which we realized approximately million in net proceeds and the million in borrowings under our term loan 
we realized approximately million from financing activities during the year ended december  principally from the sale of our common stock in which we realized approximately million in net proceeds 
we realized approximately million from financing activities during the year ended december  principally from the million in borrowings under our line of credit  million received under our agreement with biosense webster as described above  and the million in net proceeds from the sale of our common stock 
at december   we had working capital of approximately million  compared to million at december  as of december   we had an outstanding balance under our term loan of million 
in addition  we had million outstanding under the revolving line of credit and had an unused line of approximately million with current borrowing capacity of million  including amounts already drawn 
as such  we had the ability to borrow an additional million under the revolving line of credit at december  as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants of the bank loan agreement 
these credit facilities are secured by substantially all of our assets 
the credit agreements include customary affirmative  negative and financial covenants 
for example  we are restricted from incurring additional debt  disposing of or pledging our assets  entering into merger or acquisition agreements  making certain investments  allowing fundamental changes to our business  ownership  management or business locations  and from making certain payments in respect of stock or other ownership interests  such as dividends and stock repurchases 
under our loan arrangements  as in effect at december  and as modified in december  we are required to maintain various levels of tangible net worth and liquidity as defined in the loan agreement 
we are also required under the credit agreements to maintain our primary operating account and the majority of our cash and investment balances in accounts with our primary lending bank 
as of the amendment date and as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants of this agreement 
we expect to have negative cash flow from operations into throughout  we expect to continue the development and commercialization of our existing products and  to a lesser extent  our research and development programs and the advancement of new products into clinical development 
we expect that our sales and marketing expenditures and our general and administrative expenses will increase in in order to support our product commercialization efforts 
until we can generate significant cash flow from our operations  we expect to continue to fund our operations with existing cash resources that were primarily generated from the proceeds of our public offerings  private sales of our equity securities and working capital and equipment financing loans 
in the future  we may finance future cash needs through the sale of other equity securities  strategic collaboration agreements and debt financings 
we cannot accurately predict the timing and amount of our utilization of capital  which will depend on a number of factors outside of our control 
while we believe our existing cash  cash equivalents and borrowing facilities will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital equipment requirements through the next months  we cannot assure that we will not require additional financing before that time 
we also cannot assure that such additional financing will be available on a timely basis on terms acceptable to us or at all  or that such financing will not be dilutive to our stockholders 
if adequate funds are not available to us  we could be required to delay development or commercialization of new products  to license to third parties the rights to commercialize products or technologies that we would otherwise seek to commercialize ourselves or to reduce the sales  marketing  customer support or other resources devoted to our products  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently have  nor have we ever had  any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have 
table of contents been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as a result  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could have arisen if we had engaged in these relationships 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes all significant contractual payment obligations by payment due date payments by period in thousands contractual obligations under year years years over years total long term debt operating leases purchasing obligations total we have not included interest payable on our revolving credit agreement in these amounts because the interest on this obligation is calculated at a variable rate and the amount of principal outstanding fluctuates 
commercial commitments we have entered into letters of credit to support certain commitments in the aggregate amount of million 
these letters of credit expire in february item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign exchange risk we operate mainly in the us  europe and asia and we expect to continue to sell our products both within and outside of the us although the majority of our revenue and expenses are transacted in us dollars  a portion of our operations are conducted in euros and to a lesser extent  in other currencies 
as such  we have foreign exchange exposure with respect to non us dollar revenues and expenses as well as cash balances  accounts receivable  accounts payable and other asset and liability balances denominated in non us dollar currencies 
our international operations are subject to risks typical of international operations  including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
future fluctuations in the value of these currencies may affect the price competitiveness of our products
