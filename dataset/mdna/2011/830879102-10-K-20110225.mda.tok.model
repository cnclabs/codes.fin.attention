as of december   skywest airlines operated as a delta connection carrier in salt lake city  a united express carrier in los angeles  san francisco  denver  chicago and the pacific northwest  and an airtran carrier in milwaukee  operating more than  total daily flights 
atlantic southeast has been a code share partner with delta in atlanta since and united since february as of december   atlantic southeast operated as a delta connection carrier in atlanta and cincinnati and a united express carrier in chicago and washington  dc dulles international airport  operating approximately daily flights 
on november   we completed the expressjet merger 
at the effective time of the expressjet merger  each issued and outstanding share of expressjet holdings common stock other than shares of expressjet holdings common stock owned by expressjet holdings as treasury stock or shares of expressjet holdings common stock owned by skywest or any of its subsidiaries was converted into the right to receive per share in cash  payable to the holder thereof  without interest 
based on the number of outstanding shares of expressjet holdings common stock as of the effective time of the expressjet merger  the aggregate value of the expressjet merger consideration was million 
after taking into effect the number of shares acquired by skywest and its subsidiaries prior to the effective time of the expressjet merger  the aggregate value of the expressjet merger consideration was million 
expressjet provides regional jet service principally in the united states  primarily from hubs located in cleveland  newark  houston  chicago o hare and washington dulles 
expressjet offered more than  daily scheduled departures as of december   of which approximately  were continental express flights and were united express flights 
expressjet fleet as of december  consisted of erjs  of which were flown for continental  were flown for united and three were used in charter operations 
expressjet continental and united code share operations are conducted under the continental cpa and the expressjet united express agreement  pursuant to which expressjet is paid by continental or united  as applicable  primarily on a fee per completed block hour and departure basis  plus a margin based on performance incentives 
historically  multiple contractual relationships have enabled us to reduce reliance on any single major airline code and to enhance and stabilize operating results through a mix of contract flying and our controlled or pro rate flying 
for the year ended december   contract flying revenue and pro rate revenue represented approximately and  respectively  of our total passenger revenues 
on contract routes  the major airline partner controls scheduling  ticketing  pricing and seat inventories and we are compensated by the major airline partner at contracted rates based on the completed block hours  flight departures and other operating measures 
on pro rate flights  we control scheduling  ticketing  pricing and seat inventories and receive a pro rated portion of passenger fares 
for the year ended december   essentially all of our brasilia turboprops flown for delta were flown under pro rate arrangements  while approximately of our brasilia turboprops flown in the united system were flown under contractual arrangements  with the remaining flown under pro rate arrangements 
for the year ended december   approximately of our crjs flown in the united system were flown under contractual arrangements  with the remaining flown under pro rate arrangements 
on november   skywest airlines entered into a code share agreement with airtran 
under the terms of the airtran code share agreement  skywest airlines has agreed to operate four crjs for airtran under a pro rate arrangement 

table of contents financial highlights we had revenues of billion for the year ended december   a increase  compared to revenues of billion for the year ended december  we had net income of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december   an increase of  compared to million of net income  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  the significant items affecting our financial performance during the year ended december  are summarized below under the delta connection agreements  delta has the right to require that certain contractual rates under those agreements shall not exceed the average rate of all carriers within the delta connection program 
on october   delta sent letters to skywest airlines and atlantic southeast requiring them to either adjust the rates payable under their respective delta connection agreements or accept termination of those agreements 
delta letters also notified skywest airlines and atlantic southeast of delta estimate of the average rates to be applied under those agreements 
on october   skywest airlines and atlantic southeast notified delta of their election to adjust the rates payable under the delta connection agreements  however  they also notified delta of their disagreement with delta estimated rates and their belief that the methodology delta used to calculate its estimated rates is inconsistent with the terms of the delta connection agreements 
skywest airlines and atlantic southeast  on one hand  and delta  on the other hand  exchanged subsequent correspondence  and in november  the parties reached an agreement related to the average rate provisions applied under the delta connection agreements 
the delta connection agreements also provide that  beginning with the fifth anniversary of the execution of the agreements september   delta has the right to require that certain contractual rates under those agreements shall not exceed the second lowest of all carriers within the delta connection program 
on september   delta sent letters to skywest airlines and atlantic southeast requiring them to either adjust the rates payable under their respective delta connection agreements or accept termination of those agreements 
delta letters also notified skywest airlines and atlantic southeast of delta estimate of the second lowest rates to be applied under those agreements 
on september   skywest airlines and atlantic southeast notified delta of their election to adjust the rates payable under the delta connection agreements  however  they also notified delta of their disagreement with delta estimated rates and their belief that the methodology delta used to calculate its estimated rates is inconsistent with the terms of the delta connection agreements 
during the fourth quarter of  skywest airlines and atlantic southeast reached an agreement with delta on contractual rates satisfying the second lowest rate provision and agreed on rates through december  delta additionally waived its right to require that the contractual rates payable under the delta connection agreements under those agreements shall not exceed the second lowest of all carriers within the delta connection program through december  as a result of finalizing contractual rates payable under the delta connection agreements from september  through december   we recorded million in additional revenue during the quarter ended december  under the terms of the skywest airlines and atlantic southeast delta connection agreements  delta has agreed to compensate skywest airlines and atlantic southeast for initiatives that directly result in pass through cost savings 
delta has agreed to share such savings on an equal basis for a twelve month period 
during the quarter ended december   delta paid to skywest airlines and atlantic southeast approximately million in cost savings revenue 
on november   we completed the expressjet merger 
at the effective time of the expressjet merger  each issued and outstanding share of expressjet holdings common stock other than shares of expressjet holdings common stock owned by expressjet holdings as treasury stock or shares of expressjet holdings common stock owned by skywest or any of its subsidiaries was 
table of contents converted into the right to receive per share in cash  payable to the holder thereof  without interest 
based on the number of outstanding shares of expressjet holdings common stock as of the effective time of the merger  the aggregate value of the expressjet merger consideration was million 
after taking into effect the number of shares acquired by skywest and its subsidiaries  the aggregate value of the expressjet merger consideration was million 
as part of the expressjet merger  we recorded a purchase accounting gain of million 
this amount represents the difference between the consideration paid and the net fair value of expressjet holdings tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired were more than purchase price 
under the skywest airlines and atlantic southeast united express agreements  we recognize revenue in our consolidated statement of income at a fixed hourly rate for mature engine maintenance on regional jet engines and we recognize engine maintenance expense on our crj regional jet engines in our consolidated statement of income on an as incurred basis as maintenance expense 
during the year ended december   our crj engine expense under our skywest airlines and atlantic southeast united express agreements and our airtran code share agreement increased million compared to the year ended december  the increase in crj engine overhauls reimbursed at a fixed hourly rate was principally due to scheduled engine maintenance events 
we anticipate the average quarterly number of scheduled engine maintenance events we experienced during the year ended december  will likely continue each quarter through and the first quarter of total available seat miles asms for the year ended december  increased  compared to the year ended december   primarily due to the expressjet merger  as well as skywest airlines acceptance of new crjs since april   and its incremental placement of those aircraft into service over that period 
during the year ended december   we generated billion asms  compared to billion asms during the year ended december  on october   skywest airlines extended to united a secured term loan in the amount of million 
the term loan bore interest at a rate of  with a ten year amortization period 
the loan was secured by certain ground equipment and airport slot rights held by united 
on august   united repaid the million term loan 
on september   we invested million for a ownership interest in mekong aviation joint stock company  an airline operating in vietnam air mekong 
we anticipate accounting for the investment using the equity method of accounting and intend to reflect our equity interest in air mekong earnings on a one quarter lag 
outlook on january   we announced skywest airlines plans to acquire four additional regional jet aircraft during skywest airlines plans to place these aircraft into operation under the skywest airlines delta connection agreement 
additionally  we have announced plans to lease eight used crjs from another operator 
skywest airlines and atlantic southeast plan to operate the eight crjs under the skywest airlines and atlantic southeast delta connection agreements 
on january   skywest airlines agreed to operate five crjs for alaska airlines 
skywest airlines plans to lease these aircraft from alaska airlines for a nominal amount 

table of contents critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are summarized in note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   included in item of this report 
critical accounting policies are those policies that are most important to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and require management subjective and complex judgments due to the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  aircraft maintenance  aircraft leases  impairment of long lived assets and intangibles  stock based compensation expense and fair value as discussed below 
the application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results will differ  and could differ materially from such estimates 
revenue recognition passenger and ground handling revenues are recognized when service is provided 
under our contract and pro rate flying agreements with our code share partners  revenue is considered earned when the flight is completed 
our agreements with our code share partners contain certain provisions pursuant to which the parties could terminate the respective agreement  subject to certain rights of the other party  if certain performance criteria are not maintained 
our revenues could be impacted by a number of factors  including changes to the code share agreements  contract modifications resulting from contract renegotiations and our ability to earn incentive payments contemplated under applicable agreements 
in the event contracted rates are not finalized at a quarterly or annual financial statement date  we record that period revenues based on the lower of the prior period approved rates adjusted for the current contract negotiations and our estimate of rates that will be implemented in accordance with revenue recognition guidelines 
also  in the event we have a reimbursement dispute with a major partner at a quarterly or annual financial statement date  we evaluate the dispute under established revenue recognition criteria and  provided the revenue recognition criteria have been met  we recognize revenue for that period based on our estimate of the resolution of the dispute 
accordingly  we are required to exercise judgment and use assumptions in the application of our revenue recognition policy 
maintenance we use the direct expense method of accounting for our regional jet aircraft engine overhaul costs 
under this method  the maintenance liability is not recorded until the maintenance services are performed 
we use the deferral method of accounting for our brasilia turboprop engine overhauls  which provides for engine overhaul costs to be capitalized and depreciated to the next estimated overhaul event or to the remaining useful life  whichever is shorter 
for leased aircraft  we are subject to lease return provisions that require a minimum portion of the life of an overhaul be remaining on the engine at the lease return date 
with respect to engine overhauls related to leased brasilia turboprops to be returned  we adjust the estimated useful lives of the final engine overhauls based on the respective lease return dates 
with respect to skywest airlines  a third party vendor provides our long term engine services covering the scheduled and unscheduled repairs for engines on our crjs operated under the skywest airlines united express agreement 
under the terms of the vendor agreement  we pay a set dollar amount per engine hour flown on a monthly basis and the third party vendor assumes the obligation to repair the engines at no additional cost to us  subject to certain specified exclusions 
thus  under the third party vendor agreement  we expense the engine maintenance costs as flight hours are incurred on the engines and using the contractual rate set forth in the agreement 

table of contents aircraft leases the majority of skywest airlines aircraft are leased from third parties  while atlantic southeast aircraft are primarily debt financed on a long term basis and the majority of expressjet aircraft are leased from continental for a nominal amount 
in order to determine the proper classification of our leased aircraft as either operating leases or capital leases  we must make certain estimates at the inception of the lease relating to the economic useful life and the fair value of an asset as well as select an appropriate discount rate to be used in discounting future lease payments 
these estimates are utilized by management in making computations as required by existing accounting standards that determine whether the lease is classified as an operating lease or a capital lease 
all of our aircraft leases have been classified as operating leases  which results in rental payments being charged to expense over the terms of the related leases 
additionally  operating leases are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheet and accordingly  neither a lease asset nor an obligation for future lease payments is reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 
impairment of long lived and intangible assets as of december   we had approximately billion of property and equipment and related assets 
additionally  as of december   we had approximately million in intangible assets 
in accounting for these long lived and intangible assets  we make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets  the expected residual values of certain of these assets  and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and the cash flows they generate 
we recorded an intangible of approximately million relating to the acquisition of atlantic southeast 
the intangible is being amortized over fifteen years under the straight line method 
as of december   we had recorded million in accumulated amortization expense 
factors indicating potential impairment include  but are not limited to  significant decreases in the market value of the long lived assets  a significant change in the condition of the long lived assets and operating cash flow losses associated with the use of the long lived assets 
on a periodic basis  we evaluate whether the book value of our aircraft is impaired 
based on the results of the evaluations  our management concluded no impairment was necessary as of december  however  there is inherent risk in estimating the future cash flows used in the impairment test 
if cash flows do not materialize as estimated  there is a risk the impairment charges recognized to date may be inaccurate  or further impairment charges may be necessary in the future 
stock based compensation expense we estimate the fair value of stock options as of the grant date using the black scholes option pricing model 
we use historical data to estimate option exercises and employee termination in the option pricing model 
the expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the option pricing model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
the expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of our common stock and other factors 

table of contents fair value we hold certain assets that are required to be measured at fair value in accordance with united states gaap 
we determined fair value of these assets based on the following three levels of inputs level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level observable inputs other than level prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
some of our marketable securities primarily utilize broker quotes in a non active market for valuation of these securities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities  therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions 
we utilize several valuation techniques in order to assess the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities 
our cash and cash equivalents primarily utilize quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
we have valued non auction rate marketable securities using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
if a quoted price is not available  we utilize broker quotes in a non active market for valuation of these securities 
for auction rate security instruments  quoted prices in active markets are no longer available 
as a result  we have estimated the fair values of these securities utilizing a discounted cash flow 
results of operations compared to operational statistics 
the following table sets forth our major operational statistics and the associated percentages of change for the periods identified below 
year ended december  change revenue passenger miles available seat miles asms block hours departures passengers carried passenger load factor pts revenue per available seat mile cost per available seat mile fuel cost per available seat mile average passenger trip length miles revenues 
operating revenues increased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  we are reimbursed for our actual fuel costs by our major partners under our contract flying arrangements 
for financial reporting purposes  we record these reimbursements as operating revenue 
under the skywest airlines and atlantic southeast delta connection agreements and the continental cpa  we are reimbursed for our engine overhaul expenses as incurred 
we also record those engine overhaul reimbursements as operating revenue 
the following table summarizes the amount of fuel and engine overhaul 
table of contents reimbursements included in our passenger revenues for the periods indicated dollar amounts in thousands 
for the year ended december  change change passenger revenues less fuel reimbursement from major partners less engine overhaul reimbursement from major partners passenger revenue excluding fuel and engine overhauls reimbursements passenger revenues 
passenger revenues increased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  our passenger revenues  excluding fuel and engine overhaul reimbursements from major partners  increased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the increase in passenger revenues  excluding fuel and engine overhaul reimbursements  was primarily due to four factors 
first  atlantic southeast experienced an abnormally high number of flight cancellations  primarily due to weather problems in its atlanta hub  during the year ended december  additionally  on march   as a result of an internal audit  atlantic southeast grounded crj aircraft in order to perform engine safety inspections in accordance with the manufacturer recommendations 
consequently  atlantic southeast cancelled approximately more flights than normal as a result of the severe weather and the aircraft grounding during the three months ended march  those calculations contributed to an increase in passenger revenue of approximately million for the year ended december   compared to second  our block hour production increased during the year end december   compared to the year ended december  the increase in block hours was primarily due to skywest airlines taking incremental delivery of crj s since april  and the completion of expressjet merger on november  third  during the three months ended december   skywest airlines and atlantic southeast finalized certain contractual rates from september  through december  with delta 
as a result  we recorded million in additional revenue as a result of the finalization of contractual rates during the quarter ended december  fourth  under the terms of the skywest airlines and atlantic southeast delta connection agreements  delta has agreed to compensate skywest airlines and atlantic southeast for initiatives that directly result in pass through cost savings 
delta agreed to share such savings with skywest airlines and atlantic southeast on an equal basis for a twelve month period 
during the three months ended december   delta paid  and skywest airlines and atlantic southeast recognized  approximately million in cost savings revenue 
ground handling and other 
total ground handling and other revenues increased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the increase was primarily related to aircraft rental revenue to other airlines 
during the year ended december   we obtained leases for four crjs and subleased the aircraft to air mekong 
in addition  expressjet had approximately million in ground handling and other revenue during individual expense components are also expressed in the following table on the basis of cents per asm 
asm is a common metric used in the airline industry to measure an airline passenger capacity 
asms reflect both the number of aircraft in an airline fleet and the seat capacity for the aircraft in the fleet

fuel costs decreased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the average cost per gallon of fuel increased to per gallon during the year ended december   from during the year ended december  the increase in the average cost per gallon was offset by delta purchasing the majority of the fuel for our delta connection aircraft  commencing on june  united also purchased fuel directly from a fuel vendor for our united express aircraft under contract flying operated out of chicago  san francisco  los angeles and denver 
continental also purchases the majority of the fuel under the expressjet continental cpa 
the following table summarizes the gallons of fuel we purchased directly  and the change in fuel price per gallon on our fuel expense  for the periods indicated for the year ended december  in thousands  except per gallon amounts change fuel gallons purchased average price per gallon fuel expense salaries wages and employee benefits 
salaries  wages and employee benefits increased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the increase was primarily related to the completion of the expressjet merger on november  and the related increase in production 
the average number of full time equivalent employees increased to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december   due primarily to the completion of the expressjet merger 

table of contents aircraft maintenance  materials and repairs 
maintenance costs increased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the following table summarizes the amount of engine overhauls and engine overhaul reimbursements included in our aircraft maintenance expense for the periods indicated dollar amounts in thousands 
for the year ended december  change change aircraft maintenance  materials and repairs less engine overhaul reimbursed from major partners less crj engine overhauls reimbursed at fixed hourly rate aircraft maintenance excluding reimbursed engine overhauls and crj engine overhauls reimbursed at fixed hourly rate aircraft maintenance expense excluding reimbursed engine overhauls and crj engine overhauls reimbursed at fixed hourly rates  increased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the increase in maintenance excluding engine overhaul costs was principally due to the completion of the expressjet merger 
under the skywest airlines and atlantic southeast united express agreements  we recognize revenue in our consolidated statement of income at a fixed hourly rate for mature engine maintenance on regional jet engines and we recognize engine maintenance expense on our crj regional jet engines in our consolidated statement of income on an as incurred basis as maintenance expense 
during the year ended december   our crj engine expense under our skywest airlines and atlantic southeast united express agreements and our airtran code share agreement increased million compared to the year ended december  the increase in crj engine overhauls reimbursed at a fixed hourly rate was principally due to scheduled engine maintenance events 
we anticipate the average number of scheduled engine maintenance events experienced during the year ended december  will likely continue each quarter through and the first quarter of under our delta connection agreements we are reimbursed for engine overhaul costs by delta at the time the maintenance event occurs 
under our continental cpa  we are also reimbursed for actual engine cost by continental at the time the expense is incurred 
such reimbursements are reflected as passenger revenue in our consolidated statement of income 
aircraft rentals 
aircraft rentals increased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to the following two factors first  during the year ended december   we obtained leases for four crjs and subleased the aircraft to air mekong 
second  we completed the expressjet merger on november  expressjet incurred approximately million in aircraft rental expense since the completion of the expressjet merger 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the increase in depreciation expense was primarily due to skywest airlines taking incremental delivery of new crjs since april  these aircraft were financed through long term debt 
station rentals and landing fees 
station rentals and landing fees expense increased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the increase in station rentals and landing fees expense was primarily due to the acquisition of expressjet on november  and related additional station rent 

table of contents ground handling service 
ground handling service expense increased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the increase in ground handling expense was due primarily to new pro rate stations skywest airlines outsourced to other ground handlers since january  acquisition related costs 
during the year ended december   we incurred million of direct severance  legal and advisor fees associated with the expressjet merger 
other expenses 
other expenses  primarily consisting of property taxes  hull and liability insurance  crew simulator training and crew hotel costs  increased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the increase in other expenses was primarily due to the completion of the expressjet merger on november  total airline expenses 
total airline expenses consisting of total operating and interest expenses increased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  we are reimbursed for our actual fuel costs by our major partners under our contract flying arrangements 
we record the amount of those reimbursements as revenue 
under the skywest airlines and atlantic southeast delta connection agreements and the continental cpa  we are reimbursed for our engine overhaul expense  which we record as revenue 
the following table summarizes the amount of fuel and engine overhaul expenses which are included in our total airline expenses for the periods indicated dollar amounts in thousands 
for the year ended december  change change total airline expense less fuel expense less engine overhaul reimbursement from major partners less crj engine overhauls reimbursed at fixed hourly rate total airline expense excluding fuel and engine overhauls and crj engine overhauls reimbursed at fixed hourly rate excluding fuel and engine overhaul costs and crj engine overhauls reimbursed at fixed hourly rates  our total airline expenses increased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the percentage increase in total airline expenses excluding fuel and engine overhauls  was less than the percentage increase in asms  which was primarily due to the increased operating efficiencies obtained from operating larger regional jets 
impairment of marketable securities 
as a result of an ongoing valuation review of our marketable securities portfolio  we recognized a pre tax charge of approximately million during the year ended december  for certain marketable securities deemed to have other than temporary impairment 
we did not experience a corresponding charge during the year ended december  interest income 
interest income increased million  or during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the increase in interest income was due primarily to the secured term loan skywest airlines extended to united during the fourth quarter of in the amount of million 
the term loan bore interest at a rate of  with a ten year amortization period 
skywest airlines also agreed to defer million otherwise payable to skywest airlines under the skywest airlines united express agreement 
this amount accrues a deferral fee of which is reported in our consolidated statement of income as interest income 
on august   united repaid the million term loan together with accrued interest 

table of contents purchase accounting gain 
on november   we completed the expressjet merger 
as a result of the expressjet merger  we recorded a purchase accounting gain of million 
this amount represents the difference between the consideration paid and the estimated net fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the estimated net fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired was more than the purchase price 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes  as a percentage of income before taxes  decreased to in from in the reduction of reflects the impact of a purchase accounting gain that does not have a tax effect  resulting in a decrease in the rate of approximately 
this decrease was offset by an increase of approximately resulting from a decrease in tax exempt interest income and an increase in expenses not deductible for tax purposes 
we currently expects our effective tax rate to be approximately 
net income 
primarily due to factors described above  net income increased to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december   compared to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  compared to operational statistics 
the following table sets forth our major operational statistics and the associated percentages of change for the periods identified below

table of contents passenger revenues 
passenger revenues decreased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the decrease in passenger revenues was primarily due to a decrease in fuel reimbursements from our major partners 
the fuel reimbursement from our major partners decreased million or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  our passenger revenues  excluding fuel and engine overhaul reimbursements from major partners  decreased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the percentage decrease in passenger revenues  excluding fuel and engine overhaul reimbursements  was more than the percentage increase in asms  primarily due to three factors 
first  atlantic southeast experienced an abnormally high number of flight cancellations in part due to significant weather related cancellations in its atlanta hub during the three months ended march  additionally  on march   as a result of an internal audit  atlantic southeast grounded crjs in order to perform engine safety inspections in accordance with the manufacturer recommendations 
atlantic southeast cancelled approximately scheduled flights as a result of the severe weather and aircraft grounding during the first quarter of as a result  atlantic southeast experienced a negative impact on passenger revenues of approximately million 
second  delta transitioned ground handling services at stations from skywest airlines and atlantic southeast to other ground handlers during the second quarter of revenue earned under ground handling contracts where we provide ground handling services for our own aircraft is presented in the passenger revenue line in our consolidated statements of income 
third  on october   delta sent letters to skywest airlines and atlantic southeast requiring them to either adjust the rates payable under their respective delta connection agreements or accept termination of those agreements delta letter also notified skywest airlines and atlantic southeast of delta estimate of the average rates to be applied under those agreements 
on october   skywest airlines and atlantic southeast notified delta of their election to adjust the rates payable under the delta connection agreements  however  they also notified delta of their disagreement with delta estimated rates and their belief that the methodology delta used to calculate its estimated rates is inconsistent with the terms of the delta connection agreements 
because skywest airlines and atlantic southeast had not reached an agreement with delta regarding the final contractual rates to be established under the delta connection agreements as of december   we evaluated the method for calculating the average rate of the carriers within the delta connection program under the revenue recognition accounting guidance and recorded revenue under those agreements based on management understanding of the applicable terms in the delta connection agreements and management best estimate of the revenue that would ultimately be realized upon settlement of the contractual rates with delta with respect to the year ended december  skywest airlines and atlantic southeast reached an agreement with delta related to the average rate provisions in november ground handling and other 
total ground handling and other revenues increased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  revenue earned under other ground handling contracts where we provide ground handling services for other airlines is presented in the ground handling and other line in our consolidated statements of income 
the increase was primarily related to the higher volume of flights serviced under ground handling contracts with united and delta during  whereby we performed ground handling services for several other regional airlines 
individual expense components for the periods indicated are expressed in the following table on the basis of cents per asm

under the skywest airlines united express agreement and pursuant to a services agreement with midwest prior to its termination on january   we recognize revenue in our consolidated statement of income at a fixed hourly rate for mature engine maintenance on regional jet engines and we recognize engine maintenance expense on our crj regional jet engines in our consolidated statement of income on an as incurred basis as maintenance expense 
during the year ended december   our crj engine expense under our skywest airlines united express agreement and the midwest services agreement increased million 
under our delta connection agreements we were reimbursed for engine overhaul costs by delta 
such reimbursements are reflected as passenger revenue in our consolidated statements of income 
aircraft rentals 
aircraft rentals increased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the increase in aircraft rents was primarily due to atlantic southeast taking delivery of ten crjs during these aircraft were financed through long term leases 
this increase was partially offset by atlantic southeast returning atr turboprops to the lessor and terminating the associated leases 
station rentals and landing fees 
station rentals and landing fees expense decreased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the decrease in station rentals and landing fees expense was primarily due to our major partners paying for certain station rents and landing fees directly to the airport 
ground handling service 
ground handling service expense decreased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the decrease in ground handling was primarily due to united transitioning stations from skywest airlines to other ground handlers during the second quarter of and delta transitioning stations from skywest airlines and atlantic southeast to other ground handlers during the second quarter of other airline expenses 
other airline expenses  primarily consisting of property taxes  hull and liability insurance  crew simulator training and crew hotel costs  decreased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the decrease in other airline expenses was primarily due to the decrease in crew simulator training and crew hotel costs 

table of contents interest 
interest expense decreased million  or  during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the decrease in interest expense was substantially due to a decrease in interest rates 
at december   we had variable rate notes representing of our total long term debt 
the majority of our variable rate notes are based on the three month and six month libor rates

at december   the three month and six month libor rates were and  respectively 
interest income 
interest income decreased million  or during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the decrease in interest income was substantially due to the decrease in interest rates discussed in the preceding paragraph 
total airline expenses 
total airline expenses consisting of total operating and interest expenses decreased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  we are reimbursed for our actual fuel costs by our major partners under our contract flying arrangements 
we record the amount of those reimbursements as revenue 
under the skywest  skywest airlines and atlantic southeast delta connection agreements  we are reimbursed for our engine overhaul expense  which we record as revenue 
the following table summarizes the amount of fuel and engine overhaul expenses which are included in our total airline expenses for the periods indicated dollar amounts in thousands

impairment of marketable securities 
as a result of an ongoing valuation review of our marketable securities portfolio  we recognized a pre tax charge of approximately million during the year ended december  for certain marketable securities deemed to have other than temporary impairment 
other income 
during the year ended december   we negotiated the principal terms of a prospective capacity purchase agreement with continental  which was intended to become effective if we had successfully completed our proposed acquisition of the outstanding shares of capital stock of expressjet 
during the course of those negotiations  continental agreed it would pay us a break up fee under certain circumstances in the event our efforts to acquire expressjet were not successful 
in june  expressjet reached terms directly with continental on a new capacity purchase agreement  and accordingly  we were precluded from completing the acquisition of expressjet 
as a result  we received

the provision for income taxes  as a percentage of income before taxes  increased to in from in the lower rate includes the impact of a decrease to the effective state income tax rate as the result of state tax law changes in utah and other states 
the state effective tax rate also decreased slightly from to minimizing the increase of the effective tax rate from to net income 
primarily due to factors described above  net income decreased to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december   compared to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of cash cash position and liquidity

net cash provided by operating activities decreased million or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to changes in accounts payable 
during the year ended december   accounts payable and accrued aircraft rents increased million as compared to an increase in accounts payable and accrued aircraft rents of million during the year ended december  the decrease in the change in accounts payable was due primarily to the timing of our payments of engine overhaul expenses 
cash flows from investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities decreased million or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  our aircraft and rotable spare parts purchased decreased million during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the decrease in aircraft and rotable spares was primarily due to the 
table of contents acquisition of crj s during the year ended december  compared to the acquisition of only four crj s during the year ended december  we also completed the expressjet merger on november  net of cash acquired  we paid million 
in addition  the decrease was due to the collection of scheduled payments and full repayment of our term loan to united 
during the year ended december   we collected million in outstanding principal payments from united 
cash flows from financing activities 
net cash provided by used in financing activities decreased million or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the decrease was primarily related to a decrease in proceeds from the issuance of long term debt 
during the year ended december  we received proceeds from long term debt of million  as compared to the proceeds of million during the year ended december  during the year ended december   we financed four crj s with long term debt 
during the year ended december   we financed crj s with long term debt 
in addition  during the year ended december  our principal payments on long term debt increased million 
during the three months ended december   we repaid million of outstanding expressjet debt 
liquidity and capital resources we believe that in the absence of unusual circumstances  the working capital currently available to us will be sufficient to meet our present financial requirements  including anticipated expansion  planned capital expenditures  and scheduled lease payments and debt service obligations for at least the next months 
at december   our total capital mix was equity and long term debt  compared to equity and long term debt at december  as of december   skywest airlines had a million line of credit 
as of december  and  skywest airlines had no amount outstanding under the facility 
the facility expires on march  and has a fixed interest rate of 
as of december   we had million in letters of credit and surety bonds outstanding with various banks and surety institutions 
as of december  and  we classified million and million as restricted cash  respectively  related to our workers compensation policies 

table of contents significant commitments and obligations general the following table summarizes our commitments and obligations as noted for each of the next five years and thereafter in thousands total thereafter firm aircraft commitments operating lease payments for aircraft and facility obligations interest commitments principal maturities on long term debt total commitments and obligations purchase commitments and options on january   we announced skywest airlines plans to acquire four additional regional jet aircraft during skywest airlines plans to place these aircraft into operation under the skywest airlines delta connection agreement 
additionally  we have announced plans to lease eight used crjs from another operator 
skywest airlines and atlantic southeast plan to operate the eight crjs under the skywest airlines and atlantic southeast delta connection agreements 
on january   skywest airlines agreed to operate five crjs for alaska airlines 
skywest airlines plans to lease these aircraft from alaska airlines for a nominal amount 
total expenditures for these aircraft and related flight equipment  including amounts for contractual price escalations  are estimated to be approximately million through we have not historically funded a substantial portion of our aircraft acquisitions with working capital 
rather  we have generally funded our aircraft acquisitions through a combination of operating leases and long term debt financing 
at the time of each aircraft acquisition  we evaluate the financing alternatives available to us  and select one or more of these methods to fund the acquisition 
in the event that alternative financing cannot be arranged at the time of delivery  bombardier has typically financed our aircraft acquisitions until more permanent arrangements can be made 
subsequent to this initial acquisition of an aircraft  we may also refinance the aircraft or convert one form of financing to another eg  replacing debt financing with leveraged lease financing 
at present  we intend to satisfy our firm aircraft purchase commitment  as well as our acquisition of any additional aircraft  through a combination of operating leases and debt financing  consistent with our historical practices 
based on current market conditions and discussions with prospective leasing organizations and financial institutions  we currently believe that we will be able to obtain financing for our committed acquisitions  as well as additional aircraft  without materially reducing the amount of working capital available for our operating activities 
nonetheless  recent disruptions in the credit markets have resulted in greater volatility  decreased liquidity and limited availability of capital  and there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain necessary funding or that  if we are able to obtain necessary capital  the corresponding terms will be favorable or acceptable to us 
aircraft lease and facility obligations we also have significant long term lease obligations  primarily relating to our aircraft fleet 
at december   we had aircraft under lease with remaining terms ranging from one to 
table of contents years 
future minimum lease payments due under all long term operating leases were approximately billion at december  assuming a discount rate  which is the average rate used to approximate the implicit rates within the applicable aircraft leases  the present value of these lease obligations would have been equal to approximately billion at december  long term debt obligations as of december   we had  million of long term debt obligations  primarily related to the acquisition of brasilia turboprop  crj  crj and crj aircraft 
the average effective interest rate on the debt related to the brasilia turboprop and crj aircraft was approximately at december  guarantees we have guaranteed the obligations of skywest airlines under the skywest airlines delta connection agreement and the obligations of atlantic southeast under the atlantic southeast delta connection agreement and skywest and atlantic southeast have guaranteed the obligations of expressjet under the continental cpa 
new accounting standards in january  the fasb issued asu no 
 improving disclosures about fair value measurements  an amendment to accounting standards codification topic  fair value measurements and disclosures 
this amendment requires an entity to i disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements and describe the reasons for the transfers  ii disclose separately the reasons for any transfers in and out of level  and iii present separate information for level activity pertaining to gross purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements 
asu no 
is effective for us for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   with one new disclosure effective after december  we adopted this guidance beginning with the interim period ended march  see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements set forth in item of this report 
on september   the financial accounting standards board fasb ratified accounting standards update asu no 
formerly referred to as emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
asu no 
requires the allocation of consideration among separately identified deliverables contained within an arrangement  based on their related selling prices 
asu no 
will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning january   however  it will be effective only for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  early adoption is permitted 
the company has been evaluating the impact of asu no 
on its financial position  results of operations  cash flows  and disclosures 
based on our research to date  we do not believe the adoption of asu no 
will have a significant impact on our current accounting practices  however  we do expect to be required to provide additional financial disclosures due to the full adoption of the standard beginning in the first quarter of

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk aircraft fuel in the past  we have not experienced difficulties with fuel availability and we currently expect to be able to obtain fuel at prevailing prices in quantities sufficient to meet our future needs 
pursuant to our contract flying arrangements  united and continental have agreed to bear the economic risk of fuel price fluctuations on our contracted united express and continental express flights 
on our delta connection regional jet flights  delta has agreed to bear the economic risk of fuel price fluctuations 
we bear the economic risk of fuel price fluctuations on our pro rate operations 
as of december   essentially all of our brasilia turboprops flown for delta were flown under pro rate arrangements while  approximately of our brasilia turboprops flown in the united system were flown under pro rate arrangements 
as of december   we operated crjs for united under a pro rate agreement and four crjs under a pro rate agreement with airtran 
the average price per gallon of aircraft fuel increased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  for illustrative purposes only  we have estimated the impact of the market risk of fuel on our pro rate operations using a hypothetical increase of in the price per gallon we purchase 
based on this hypothetical assumption  we would have incurred an additional million in fuel expense for the year ended december  interest rates our earnings are affected by changes in interest rates due to the amounts of variable rate long term debt and the amount of cash and securities held 
the interest rates applicable to variable rate notes may rise and increase the amount of interest expense 
we would also receive higher amounts of interest income on cash and securities held at the time  however  the market value of our available for sale securities would likely decline 
at december   we had variable rate notes representing of our total long term debt compared to of our long term debt at december  for illustrative purposes only  we have estimated the impact of market risk using a hypothetical increase in interest rates of one percentage point for both variable rate long term debt and cash and securities 
based on this hypothetical assumption  we would have incurred an additional million in interest expense and received million in additional interest income for the year ended december   and we would have incurred an additional million in interest expense and received million in additional interest income for the year ended december  however  under our contractual arrangement with our major partners  the majority of the increase in interest expense would be passed through and recorded as passenger revenue in our consolidated statements of income 
if interest rates were to decline  our major partners would receive the principal benefit of the decline  since interest expense is generally passed through to our major partners  resulting in a reduction to passenger revenue in our consolidated statement of income 
we currently intend to finance the acquisition of aircraft through manufacturer financing  third party leases or long term borrowings 
changes in interest rates may impact the actual cost to us to acquire these aircraft 
to the extent we place these aircraft in service under our code share agreements with delta  united or continental  our code share agreements currently provide that reimbursement rates will be adjusted higher or lower to reflect changes in our aircraft rental rates 
auction rate securities we have investments in auction rate securities  which are classified as available for sale securities and reflected at fair value 
due primarily to instability in credit markets over the past three years  we sold a portion of these investments 
as of december   we had investments valued at a total of million which were classified as other assets on our consolidated balance sheet
