government regulation various aspects of our business are governed by federal and state laws and regulations 
because sanctions may be imposed for violations of these laws  compliance is a significant operational requirement 
we believe we are in substantial compliance with all existing legal requirements material to the operation of our business 
there are  however  significant uncertainties involving the application of many of these legal requirements to our business 
in addition  there are numerous proposed health care laws and regulations at the federal and state levels  many of which could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we are unable to predict what additional federal or state legislation or regulatory initiatives may be enacted in the future relating to our business or the health care industry in general  or what effect any such legislation or regulations might have on us 
we also cannot provide any assurance that federal or state governments will not impose additional restrictions or adopt interpretations of existing laws or regulations that could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial performance 

table of contents some of the state laws described below may be preempted in whole or in part by the employee retirement income security act of erisa  which provides for comprehensive federal regulation of employee benefit plans 
however  the scope of erisa preemption is uncertain and is subject to conflicting court rulings 
we also provide services to certain clients  such as governmental entities  that are not subject to the preemption provisions of erisa 
federal laws and regulations affecting our business the following descriptions identify various federal laws and regulations that affect or may affect aspects of our business medicare part d laws and regulations 
the medicare voluntary outpatient prescription drug benefit  part d  was established under the medicare prescription drug  improvement  and modernization act of  or mma  and has been amended subsequently by several statutes  most notably by the medicare improvements for patients and providers act of  or mippa 
the mma also created guidelines for medicare hmos  known as medicare advantage plans  which offer both an outpatient prescription drug benefit and health care coverage 
medicare beneficiaries who elect part d coverage pay a monthly premium for the covered outpatient drug benefit 
assistance with premiums and cost sharing are provided to eligible low income beneficiaries 
the voluntary outpatient prescription drug benefit requires coverage of essentially the same pharmaceuticals that are approved for the medicaid program  although selection may be restricted through a formulary 
the outpatient prescription drug benefit is offered on an insured basis by prescription drug plans  or pdps  in regions across the united states and by medicare advantage plans  along with health care coverage  in regions across the united states 
we are neither a pdp nor a medicare advantage plan  however  we contract with pdps and medicare advantage plans  collectively part d plans  to provide various pbm services 
in our capacity as a subcontractor with certain part d plan clients  we are indirectly subject to certain federal rules  regulations  and sub regulatory guidance pertaining to the operation of medicare part d 
if the federal center for medicare medicaid services  referred to as cms  determines that we have not performed satisfactorily as a subcontractor  cms may request our pdp or medicare advantage plan client to revoke our part d activities or responsibilities under the subcontract 
while we believe that we provide satisfactory levels of service under our respective subcontracts  we can give no assurances that cms or a part d plan will not terminate our business relationships insofar as they pertain to medicare part d 
among other things  pdps and medicare advantage plans are subject to provisions of the mma intended to deter fraud  waste and abuse and are strictly monitored by cms and its contracted medicare drug integrity contractors  or medics  to ensure that part d program funds are not spent inappropriately 
among other things  the fraud  waste and abuse provisions of cms s medicare prescription drug benefit manual cites the following examples of potential pbm fraud  waste and abuse risks in connection with part d prescription drug switching  unlawful remuneration  inappropriate formulary decisions  prescription drug splitting or shorting  and failure to offer negotiated prices 
cms has offered additional sub regulatory guidance regarding some of these risk areas  particularly with respect to the part d formulary decision making process which is highly regulated by cms 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the applicable laws pertaining to these risk areas 
however  no assurance can be given that we will not be subject to scrutiny or challenge under one or more of the underlying laws by the government enforcers or private litigants 
cms requires pdps and medicare advantage plans to report of all price concessions received for pbm services 
the applicable cms guidance suggests that best practices would require pdps and medicare advantage plans to contractually require the right to audit their pbms as well as require transparency as to manufacturer rebates paid for drugs provided under the sponsor s plan  including the portion of such rebates retained by the pbm as part of the price concession for the pbm s services 
additionally  cms requires part d plan sponsors to ensure through their contractual arrangements with first tier  downstream and related entities which would include pbms 
table of contents that cms has access to such entities books and records pertaining to services performed in connection with part d 
cms also suggests that part d plan sponsors should contractually require their first tier  downstream and related entities to comply with certain elements of the sponsor s compliance program 
such disclosure and auditing requirements  to the extent required by medicare plan partners  have not had a materially adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition  or cash flows  however  there can be no assurances as to future effects 
cms also requires part d plan sponsors to calculate beneficiary cost sharing based upon the price ultimately received by the pharmacy or other dispensing provider  rather than upon the price paid by the plan 
such calculation could potentially result in lower pharmacy claims reimbursement by part d plan sponsors to pbms 
in addition  cms requires that any profit realized or loss incurred by a pbm through price negotiations with pharmacies or manufacturers be included as administrative costs to the plan rather than being factored into drug costs for reimbursement purposes 
while there can be no certainty  given our existing arrangements with part d plan sponsors  we do not currently expect that such changes will materially adversely affect our business  results of operations  financial conditions or cash flows 
in connection with mippa  cms issued regulations in january revising the requirements applicable to part d plan formularies 
certain of these requirements went into effect during plan contract year although there can be no certainty  we do not currently expect that such changes will materially adversely affect our business  results of operations  financial conditions or cash flows 
additionally  the enactment of the health care reform legislation discussed below will require changes to the medicare advantage and part d prescription drug programs in the near term 
several key provisions of the legislation regarding drug coverage for brand and generic part d drugs purchased within the so called donut hole coverage gap phase of the part d benefit go into effect for the contract year 
the changes include the requirement that pharmaceutical manufacturers provide eligible medicare part d beneficiaries access to discount prices for certain brand drugs for enrollees who have reached or exceeded the initial part d coverage limit  as well as a reduction in beneficiaries cost sharing obligations under basic prescription drug coverage for generic covered part d drugs purchased during the coverage gap 
although we do not believe that the implementation of these requirements will have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition  or cash flow  many of the implementing rules and guidance have yet to be developed and it remains too early to speculate on the potential effects of such requirements 
federal anti remuneration fraud and abuse laws 
the federal healthcare anti kickback statute generally prohibits an entity from paying or receiving  subject to certain exceptions and safe harbors  any remuneration  directly or indirectly  to induce the referral of individuals covered by federally funded health care programs  including medicare  medicaid and the civilian health and medical program of the uniformed services  or champus  or the purchase  or the arranging for or recommending of the purchase  of items or services for which payment may be made in whole or in part under medicare  medicaid  champus or other federally funded health care programs 
sanctions for violating the anti kickback statute may include imprisonment  criminal and civil fines  and exclusion from participation in the federally funded health care programs 
the federal healthcare anti kickback statute has been interpreted broadly by courts  the office of inspector general  referred to as the oig  within the us department of health human services  or the dhhs  and other administrative bodies 
because of the statute s broad scope and the limited statutory exceptions  federal regulations establish certain safe harbors from liability 
for example  safe harbors exist for certain properly disclosed and reported discounts received from vendors  certain investment interests  certain properly disclosed payments made by vendors to group purchasing organizations  certain personal services arrangements  and certain discount and payment arrangements between pbms and hmo risk contractors serving medicaid and medicare members 
a practice that does not fall within an exception or a safe harbor is not necessarily unlawful  but may be subject to scrutiny and challenge 
in the absence of an applicable exception or safe harbor  a violation of the statute may occur even if only one purpose of a payment arrangement is to induce patient referrals or purchases of products or services that are reimbursed by federal health care programs 
in addition  the health care reform legislation discussed below expanded the criminal intent standard under the anti kickback statute such that the government need not prove specific knowledge of or intent to violate the anti kickback statute in order to establish a violation 
among the 
table of contents practices that have been identified by the oig as potentially improper under the statute are certain product conversion programs in which benefits are given by drug manufacturers to pharmacists or physicians for changing a prescription  or recommending or requesting such a change  from one drug to another 
the anti kickback statute has been cited as a partial basis  along with state consumer protection laws discussed below  for investigations and multi state settlements relating to financial incentives provided by drug manufacturers to retail pharmacies as well as to pbms in connection with such programs 
additionally  it is a crime under the public contractor anti kickback statute  for any person to knowingly and willfully offer or provide any remuneration to a prime contractor to the united states  including a contractor servicing federally funded health programs  in order to obtain favorable treatment in a subcontract 
violators of this law also may be subject to civil monetary penalties 
there have been a series of substantial civil and criminal investigations and settlements  at the state and federal level  involving pharmacy benefit managers over the last several years in connection with alleged kickback schemes 
such cases have included allegations that pbms inflated service fees charged to pharmaceutical manufacturers and that pbms made payments to customers allegedly intended to induce business 
we are not a party in any such cases  and we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the legal requirements imposed by such anti remuneration laws and regulations 
however  there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to scrutiny or challenge under such laws or regulations 
any such challenge could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
federal statutes prohibiting false claims 
the federal false claims act imposes civil penalties for knowingly making or causing to be made false claims with respect to governmental programs  such as medicare and medicaid  for services not rendered  or for misrepresenting actual services rendered  in order to obtain higher reimbursement 
private individuals may bring qui tam or whistleblower suits against providers under the federal false claims act  which authorizes the payment of a portion of any recovery to the individual bringing suit 
such actions are initially required to be filed under seal pending their review by the department of justice 
a few federal district courts have interpreted the federal false claims act as applying to claims for reimbursement that violate the anti kickback statute or federal physician self referral law under certain circumstances and  most recently  the health reform legislation has confirmed that an anti kickback statute violation may trigger liability under the federal false claims act 
the federal false claims act generally provides for the imposition of civil penalties and for treble damages  resulting in the possibility of substantial financial penalties for small billing errors that are replicated in a large number of claims  as each individual claim could be deemed to be a separate violation of the federal false claims act 
criminal provisions that are similar to the federal false claims act provide that a corporation may be fined if it is convicted of presenting to any federal agency a claim or making a statement that it knows to be false  fictitious or fraudulent 
there have been several qui tam actions filed under the federal false claims act  the public contractor anti kickback statute and similar state laws in various federal courts against several pbms 
the complaints allege  among other things  that such pbms improperly favored the products of certain pharmaceutical manufacturers over less expensive products and engaged in improper mail order pharmacy practices 
for example  in october  medco health solutions entered into a million civil settlement of claims under both state and federal false claims statutes that it destroyed and canceled valid patient prescriptions  solicited kickbacks from pharmaceutical manufacturers to favor their drugs and paid kickbacks to health plans to obtain business 
also  in september  caremark entered into a million civil settlement of claims under both state and federal false claims statutes that its subsidiary  advancepcs  allegedly solicited and received kickbacks from pharmaceutical manufacturers in the form of excessive administrative fees  over priced services agreements as a reward for favorable formulary treatment  and improper flat fee rebates  and that advancepcs allegedly paid kickbacks to customers and potential customers to induce them to contract with advancepcs 
both medco and caremark agreed to enter into five year corporate integrity agreements with the federal government in connection with their respective settlements 
currently  we do not directly contract with the federal government to provide services to beneficiaries of federally funded health programs 
therefore  we do not directly submit claims to the federal government 
however  we do contract with and provide services to entities or organizations that are federal government contractors  such as medicare part d pdps 
in recent years  the government has increased its focus on and enforcement of the federal fraud and abuse laws  including the federal false claims act 
the fraud enforcement and recovery act  signed 
table of contents into federal law on may   broadened significantly the scope of the federal false claims act and limited the availability of certain defenses available previously to entities with indirect ties to federal funds 
the health care reform legislation significantly expands the reach of both the anti kickback statute and the federal false claims act and includes new and strengthened mechanisms for combating fraud  waste and abuse in federal and state health care programs 
finally  the obama administration has created the health care fraud prevention and enforcement action team  known as heat  and has proposed allocating billion to dhhs in the fiscal year budget for fraud fighting activities 
there can be no assurance that the government would not potentially view one or more of our actions in providing services to federal government contractors as causing or assisting in the presentment of a false claim 
we do not believe we are in violation of the federal false claims act  and we have a corporate compliance and ethics program  policies and procedures and internal controls in place to help maintain an organizational culture of honesty and integrity 
erisa regulation 
erisa regulates certain aspects of employee pension and health benefit plans  including self funded corporate health plans 
we have agreements with self funded corporate health plans to provide pbm services  and therefore  we are a service provider to erisa plans 
erisa imposes duties on any person or entity that is a fiduciary with respect to the erisa plan 
we administer pharmacy benefits for erisa plans in accordance with plan design choices made by the erisa plan sponsors 
we do not believe that the general conduct of our business subjects us to the fiduciary obligations set forth by erisa  except when we have specifically contracted with an erisa plan sponsor to accept fiduciary responsibility and be named as a fiduciary for certain functions 
numerous lawsuits have been filed against various pbms by private litigants  whether by a plan participant on behalf of an erisa plan or by the erisa plan sponsor  alleging that the pbms are erisa fiduciaries and that  in such capacity  they allegedly violated erisa fiduciary duties in connection with certain business practices related to their respective contracts with retail pharmacy networks and or pharmaceutical manufacturers 
for example  in  medco settled a lawsuit that alleged that medco was a functional fiduciary under erisa and violated its fiduciary obligations by  among other things  failing to make adequate disclosures regarding certain rebates from pharmaceutical manufacturers and steering clients toward more expensive pharmaceuticals with higher rebates benefiting medco and its then parent company  merck co  inc pursuant to the settlement  medco agreed to pay million into a settlement fund to be distributed to plan participants 
in addition  medco agreed to implement and continue certain business practices aimed at increasing transparency around formulary decisions and therapeutic interchanges 
medco did not admit  and the settlement did not require medco to admit  any wrongdoing under erisa or otherwise 
several recent cases further addressed the issue of whether a pbm is a fiduciary under erisa 
in an action brought against caremark  a plan alleged that caremark violated its fiduciary duty under erisa by hiding pricing spreads that yielded significant revenue for the pbm but was not passed on to the plan 
in november  the united states district court for the middle district of tennessee found that caremark was not a fiduciary under erisa because caremark did not have discretion to unilaterally set prices for prescriptions and because the agreement between caremark and the plan did not prohibit caremark from negotiating with retail pharmacies for favorable pricing 
similarly  in another action against caremark  a multiemployer health fund alleged that caremark breached its erisa fiduciary duties by charging the fund higher prices for drugs than caremark itself paid  as well as for failing to pass on to the fund all price concessions that caremark received from retailers and manufacturers 
in january  the seventh circuit found that caremark was not a fiduciary because the fund possessed the sole authority to control and administer prescription drug benefits and because caremark s contracts with the fund provided that caremark was not a fiduciary 
in a case brought by a labor organization against its health plan s pbm  express scripts  the united states district court for the eastern district of missouri held in july that express scripts was a fiduciary in connection with the payment of certain monies under a discontinued therapeutic substitution program  but that express scripts was not a fiduciary with respect to mac generic drug pricing  selecting the source for average wholesale price  or awp  pricing  establishing formularies and negotiating rebates  or interest earned on rebates before the payment of the contracted client share 

table of contents in those cases where we have not accepted fiduciary status  there can be no assurance that the us department of labor  the agency that enforces erisa  or a private litigant would not assert that the fiduciary obligations imposed by the statute apply to certain aspects of our operations 
erisa also imposes civil and criminal liability on service providers to health plans and certain other persons if certain forms of illegal remuneration are made or received 
these provisions of erisa are similar  but not identical  to the federal healthcare anti kickback statute discussed above 
in particular  erisa does not provide the statutory and regulatory safe harbor exceptions incorporated into the federal healthcare anti kickback statute 
like the health care anti kickback laws  the corresponding provisions of erisa are written broadly and their application to particular cases is often uncertain 
we have implemented policies regarding  among other things  disclosure to health plan sponsors with respect to any commissions paid by or to us that might fall within the scope of such provisions and accordingly believe we are in substantial compliance with these provisions of erisa 
however  we can provide no assurance that our policies in this regard would be found by the appropriate enforcement authorities and potential private litigants to meet the requirements of erisa 
on december   the us department of labor published proposed rules under erisa that  if made final  would redefine what constitutes a reasonable contract or arrangement exempt from the prohibited transaction provisions of erisa 
essentially  the proposed rules require a written agreement between certain service providers that may include a pbm and an employee benefit plan that would require the disclosure of compensation arrangements so that the plan fiduciary can assess the reasonableness of the compensation and the potential for conflicts of interests that could affect performance of the negotiated services 
the proposed rules would also require that for a contract to be considered reasonable it must permit termination by the erisa plan on reasonably short notice without penalty to prevent the plan from being locked into a contract that has become disadvantageous  although the plan can be charged a fee on early termination to allow the service provider to recover start up costs 
the department of labor received several comments arguing that the rationales for the proposed rule apply to pension plans  but not to welfare benefit plans 
other commenters argued that if the department of labor created disclosure rules for welfare benefit plan service providers  they should be promulgated separately 
in response to those comments  the department of labor  acknowledging the existence of sufficient differences between pension and welfare benefit plans to justify separate rules  issued on july  interim final regulations requiring that certain service providers of employee pension benefit plans disclose information to assist plan fiduciaries in assessing the reasonableness of contracts or arrangements  including the reasonableness of the service providers compensation and potential conflicts of interest that may affect the service providers performance 
on december   the department of labor held a public hearing to explore what particular provisions of the interim final rules relating to pension plans should and should not apply to welfare benefit plans 
although we have not been informed otherwise  we cannot say with any degree of certainty that interim final rules for welfare benefit plans will not be issued this year 
it is difficult to assess how the final rules might impact group health plans and the services provided by us as a pbm 
although we believe the proposed rules are not sufficiently specific in many technical regards  because of disclosures already made  and the current marketplace regarding the length of contracts and pricing arrangements  we do not believe that complying with the proposed rules  should they become final in their current form  would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
fda regulation 
the us food and drug administration  or fda  generally has authority to regulate drug promotional materials that are disseminated by or on behalf of a drug manufacturer 
in january  the fda issued a notice and draft guidance regarding its intent to regulate certain drug promotion and switching activities of pbms that are controlled  directly or indirectly  by drug manufacturers 
after extending the comment period due to numerous industry objections to the proposed draft  the fda has taken no further action on the notice and draft guidance 
however  there can be no assurance that the fda will not attempt again to assert jurisdiction over aspects of our business in the future and  although we are not controlled directly or indirectly by any drug manufacturer  the impact of any future fda regulation could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 

table of contents antitrust regulation 
the federal antitrust laws regulate trade and commerce and prohibit unfair competition as defined by those laws 
section one of the sherman antitrust act prohibits contracts  combinations or conspiracies in restraint of trade or commerce 
despite its sweeping language  however  section one of the sherman act has been interpreted to prohibit only unreasonable restraints on competition 
section two of the sherman act prohibits monopolization and attempts at monopolization 
similarly  section seven of the clayton act prohibits unlawful mergers and acquisitions 
in addition  the robinson patman act  which is part of the clayton act  prohibits certain types of conduct relating to the sale of goods  including prohibiting practices the statute defines as price discrimination 
one section of the robinson patman act prohibits a seller from selling goods of like grade or quality to different customers at different prices if the favorable prices are not available to all customers competing in the same class of trade 
successful plaintiffs in antitrust actions are allowed to recover treble damages for the damage sustained as a result of the violation 
numerous lawsuits are pending against several pbms and pharmaceutical manufacturers under various state and federal antitrust laws by retail pharmacies throughout the united states challenging certain branded drug pricing practices 
the complaints allege  in part  that the defendant pbms accepted rebates and discounts from pharmaceutical manufacturers on purchases of brand name prescription drugs and conspired with other pbms to fix prices in violation of the robinson patman act and the sherman antitrust act 
the suits seek unspecified monetary damages  including treble damages  and injunctive relief 
these cases are in various stages of litigation 
several have been consolidated in multidistrict litigation with outcomes pending 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the legal requirements imposed by the antitrust laws 
however  there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to scrutiny or challenge under such legislation 
to the extent that we have actual or potential market power in a relevant market  our business arrangements and practices may be subject to heightened scrutiny under the antitrust laws 
any such challenge could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
health care reform legislation 
on march   president obama signed the patient protection and affordable care act and on march   he signed the health care and education reconciliation act of  which included a series of amendments to the patient protection and affordable care act  collectively known as aca 
aca authorizes health insurance reforms that will take effect over the next decade and that will have far reaching implications for individuals and businesses 
as a result of aca  we have been assisting our clients with implementation of their obligations under the legislation 
the key features of aca that may impact pbm providers are transparency reporting requirements with respect to generic dispensing rates and negotiated price concessions  requirements to cover certain preventive services with no cost sharing requirements  new coverage determinations and claims appeals processes  requirements to cover a set of yet to be determined prescription drugs under the essential health benefits package  and a requirement to maintain a medical loss ratio of or higher in the large group market and or higher in the individual and small group markets 
although aca provides for these and other health insurance reforms  we do not believe that our obligations  or our efforts to assist our clients with their obligations  under aca will have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
state laws and regulations affecting our business the following descriptions identify various state laws and regulations that affect or may affect aspects of our business state anti remuneration false claims laws 
several states have laws and or regulations similar to the federal healthcare anti kickback statute and federal false claims act described above 
the federal deficit reduction act of  or dra  gave incentive to states to enact their own false claims acts  mirrored on the federal false claims act  described above 
such state laws are not necessarily limited to services or items for which federally funded health care program payments may be made 
such state laws may be broad enough to include improper payments made in connection with services or items that 
table of contents are paid by commercial payors 
both the medco health solutions and caremark settlements  discussed above under federal statutes prohibiting false claims  included settlement of civil claims under several state false claims laws 
sanctions for violating these state anti remuneration and false claims laws may include injunction  imprisonment  criminal and civil fines and exclusion from participation in the state medicaid programs 
additionally  under the deficit reduction act of  discussed in greater detail below  states are incentivized to pass broad false claims legislation similar to the federal false claims act 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the legal requirements imposed by such laws and regulations 
however  there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to scrutiny or challenge under such laws or regulations 
any such challenge could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
state consumer protection laws 
most states have enacted consumer protection and deceptive trade laws that generally prohibit payments and other broad categories of conduct deemed harmful to consumers 
these statutes may be enforced by states and or private litigants 
such laws have been and continue to be the basis for investigations  prosecutions and settlements of pbms  initiated by state prosecutors as well as by private litigants 
for example  in february  cvs caremark agreed to a settlement with states attorneys general for million to resolve allegations that cvs caremark engaged in deceptive business practices by retaining the discounts and rebates obtained from switching patients to different brand name prescription drugs 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the legal requirements imposed by such laws and regulations 
however  no assurance can be given that we will not be subject to scrutiny or challenge under one or more of these laws  or under similar consumer protection theories 
state comprehensive pbm regulation 
states continue to introduce legislation to regulate pbm activities in a comprehensive manner 
legislation seeking to impose fiduciary duties or disclosure obligations on pbms has been proposed in some states 
both maine and the district of columbia have enacted statutes imposing fiduciary obligations on pbms 
however  the district of columbia statute imposing fiduciary duties on pbms and requiring pbms to disclose certain financial information  including the quantity of drugs purchased and the price paid by the pbm for such drugs  was found by the dc circuit court of appeals to be preempted by erisa  and therefore it was never implemented 
the maine statute applies only to contracts entered into in maine with respect to pbm customers  or covered entities in maine 
under the maine law  pbms have a contractual fiduciary responsibility to pass through to their clients any price concessions received from drug manufacturers that are associated with volume of sales or utilization of certain drug classes 
the maine law also requires pbms to report all financial terms and arrangements for remuneration of any kind between the pbm and drug manufacturer 
similarly  iowa  kansas  north dakota  south dakota and vermont have relatively comprehensive pbm laws that  among other things  increase required financial transparency  and regulate therapeutic interchange programs 
many states have licensure or registration laws governing certain types of ancillary health care organizations  including preferred provider organizations  tpas  companies that provide utilization review services and companies that engage in the practices of a pharmacy 
the scope of these laws differs significantly from state to state  and the application of such laws to the activities of pbms often is unclear 
several other states  including connecticut  georgia  louisiana  maryland  mississippi  rhode island and tennessee  have enacted laws regulating various pbm activities  and similar legislation is pending in several more states 
such state laws do not appear to be having a material adverse effect on our business operations or our ability to negotiate and or retain rebates and administrative fees from pharmaceutical manufacturers with respect to our customers in those states 
we believe that we currently maintain in good standing or are in the process of applying for all such state licenses and registrations required for our business 
however  we can give no assurance that these and other states will not enact legislation with more adverse consequences in the near future  nor can we be certain that future regulations or interpretations of existing laws will not adversely change the consequences experienced to date of existing laws 
in addition  certain quasi regulatory organizations  including the national association of boards of pharmacy  an organization of state boards of pharmacy  the national association of insurance commissioners  or naic  an organization of state insurance regulators  and urac and the national committee on quality assurance ncqa  
table of contents both accreditation organizations  have considered or have passed proposals to regulate pbms and or pbm activities  such as formulary development and utilization management 
we maintain urac accreditation for drug therapy management as well as full accreditation as a pbm  which includes evaluation of organizational quality  customer service  communications  disclosure of pricing policies  pharmaceutical distribution  drug utilization management  and pharmacy and therapeutics committees 
in the summer of  the naic adopted the health carrier prescription drug benefit management model act which sets forth model provisions for states to regulate formularies and create an exceptions process to provide access to non formulary medicines and avoid drug management requirements such as step therapy 
while the actions of the naic do not have the force of law  they may influence states to adopt requirements similar to the model act 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all such laws and requirements where required  and we continue to monitor legislative and regulatory developments 
there can be no assurance  however  regarding the future interpretation of these laws and their applicability to the activities of our business 
future legislation or regulation  or interpretations by regulatory and quasi regulatory authorities of existing laws and regulations  could materially affect the cost and nature of our business as currently conducted 
network access legislation 
a majority of states now have some form of legislation affecting our ability to limit access to a pharmacy provider network  referred to as any willing provider legislation  or removal of a network provider  referred to as due process legislation 
such legislation may require us or our clients to admit any retail pharmacy willing to meet the plan s price and other terms for network participation  or may provide that a provider may not be removed from a network except in compliance with certain procedures 
similarly  there are any willing pharmacy provisions applicable to medicare part d plans with which we contract 
these statutes have not materially affected our business  results of operations  financial condition or cash flows  however  there can be no assurances that such will be the case in the future 
state legislation affecting plan or benefit design 
some states have enacted legislation that prohibits certain types of managed care plan sponsors from implementing certain restrictive design features  and many states have legislation regulating various aspects of managed care plans  including provisions relating to the pharmacy benefits 
for example  some states  under so called freedom of choice legislation  provide that members of the plan may not be required to use network providers  but must instead be provided with benefits even if they choose to use non network providers 
other states have enacted legislation purporting to prohibit health plans from offering members financial incentives for use of mail service pharmacies 
legislation has been introduced in some states to prohibit or restrict therapeutic intervention including  without limitation  to carve out certain classes from generic substitution  to require coverage of all fda approved drugs or to require coverage for off label uses of drugs where those uses are recognized in peer reviewed medical journals or reference compendia 
other states mandate coverage of certain benefits or conditions and require health plan coverage of specific drugs  if deemed medically necessary by the prescribing physician 
such legislation does not generally apply to us directly  but may apply to certain of our clients  such as hmos and health insurers 
if legislation were to become widely adopted  it could have the effect of limiting the economic benefits achievable through pbms 
this development could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
state regulation of financial risk plans 
fee for service prescription drug plans are generally not subject to financial regulation by the states 
however  if a pbm offers prescription drug coverage on a capitated basis or otherwise accepts material financial risk in providing the benefit  laws in various states may regulate the plan 
such laws may require that the party at risk establish reserves or otherwise demonstrate financial responsibility 
laws that may apply in such cases include insurance laws  hmo laws or limited prepaid health service plan laws 
currently  we do not believe that our business currently incurs financial risk of the type subject to such regulation 
however  if we choose to become a regional pdp for the medicare outpatient prescription drug benefit at some time in the future  we would need to comply with state laws governing risk bearing entities in the states where we operate a pdp 

table of contents state discount drug card regulation 
numerous states have laws and or regulations regulating the selling  marketing  promoting  advertising or distributing of commercial discount drug cards for cash purchases 
such laws and regulations provide  generally  that any person may bring an action for damages or seek an injunction for violations 
we administer a limited commercial discount drug card program that we do not consider material to our business 
we believe our administration of the commercial discount drug card program is in compliance with various state laws 
however  there can be no assurance that the existence of such laws will not materially impact our ability to offer certain new commercial products and or services in the future 
combined federal and state laws  regulations and other standards affecting our business certain aspects of our business are or may be affected by bodies of law that exist at both the federal and state levels and by other standard setting entities 
among these are the following privacy and confidentiality legislation 
our activities involve the receipt or use of confidential medical information concerning individual members 
in addition  we use aggregated and de identified data for research and analysis purposes 
many state laws restrict the use and disclosure of confidential medical information and impose specific security standards  and similar new legislative and regulatory initiatives are underway in several states 
to date  no such laws adversely impact our ability to provide our services  but there can be no assurance that federal or state governments will not enact such legislation  impose restrictions or adopt interpretations of existing laws that could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
the final privacy regulations  the privacy rule  issued by the dhhs pursuant to the health information portability and accountability act  or hipaa  imposes extensive restrictions on the use and disclosure of identifiable health information or phi by certain entities known under the privacy rule as covered entities 
pbms  in general  are not considered covered entities 
however  our mail order pharmacy is a covered entity and must comply with these restrictions 
additionally  our clients are covered entities  and are required to enter into business associate agreements with vendors  such as pbms  that perform a function or activity for the covered entity that involves the use or disclosure of phi 
the business associate agreements mandated by the privacy rule create a contractual obligation for the pbm to perform its duties for the covered entity in compliance with the privacy rule 
on february   congress enacted subtitle d of the health information technology for economic and clinical health act hitech provisions of the american recovery and reinvestment act of hitech amends hipaa  and among other things  expands and strengthens hipaa enforcement  imposes new penalties for non compliance  and establishes new breach notification requirements for covered entities and their business associates 
the final transactions and code sets regulation  the transaction rule  promulgated under hipaa requires that all covered entities that engage in electronic transactions use standardized formats and code sets 
dhhs recently revised the rules pertaining to standardized formats and code sets  and the compliance date for the revised standards is october  it is incumbent upon pbms to conduct all such transactions in accordance with the transaction rule to satisfy the obligations of their covered entity clients 
additionally  dhhs requires health plans to utilize national provider identifiers  or npis  in all standard transactions 
npis are intended to replace national association of boards of pharmacy numbers for pharmacies  drug enforcement agency numbers for physicians and similar identifiers for other health care providers 
we have configured our systems to comply with the npi requirements and the transaction rule s current requirements 
we do not anticipate any material difficulty in meeting the october  deadline for compliance with the revised rules for standardized formats and code sets 
the final security regulations  the security rule  issued pursuant to hipaa mandate the use of administrative  physical and technical safeguards to protect the confidentiality of electronic health care information 
under hitech  business associates are responsible for compliance with all of hipaa s security standards 
business associates are also directly liable for hipaa violations and subject to both state and federal enforcement 
we have made the necessary arrangements to ensure compliance with the security rule 

table of contents compliance with the privacy rule  the transaction rule and the security rule  together called hipaa regulations  and also applicable state data security laws has not had a material adverse effect on our business operations 
also  pursuant to hipaa  state laws that are more protective of medical information are not pre empted by hipaa 
therefore  to the extent states enact more protective legislation  we could be required to make significant changes to our business operations 
we also face significant reputational harm in the event that we are responsible for a breach of phi or personal data protected by state law and responsible for publicly reporting the breach in accordance with the law 
independent of any regulatory restrictions  individual health plan sponsor clients could increase limitations on our use of medical information  which could prevent us from offering certain services 
legislation and litigation affecting drug prices 
various federal and state medicaid agencies  as well as legislators and private litigants have raised the issue of how awp is determined 
awp is a standard pricing unit published by third party data sources and currently used throughout the pbm industry as the basis for determining drug pricing under contracts with clients  pharmacies and pharmaceutical manufacturers 
under mma  awp no longer serves as the basis for medicare part b drug reimbursement  with certain limited exceptions 
rather  part b drugs generally are reimbursed on an average sales price  or asp  methodology 
the asp calculation methodology  which takes into account various discounts offered by drug manufacturers  may cause some drug manufacturers to reduce the levels of discounts or rebates available to pbms or their clients with respect to medicare part b drugs 
drugs that are reimbursed on an asp reimbursement system by medicare do not represent a significant portion of our business and we therefore do not believe that asp reimbursement for such drugs will have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
either the use of asp in pricing outside the medicare part b context or changes to awp state and federal programs could alter the calculation of drug prices for federal and or state programs 
we are aware that a small number of states have determined to reimburse for certain medicaid drugs using an asp based methodology 
we are unable to predict whether any such changes will be adopted on a larger scale  and whether such changes would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
as part of recent class action settlements in massachusetts  first databank  or fdb  and medispan each agreed to reduce the reported awp of thousands of specific pharmaceutical products by five to ten percent  effective september  additionally  independent of the settlement  fdb and medispan announced that they plan to discontinue publishing the awp data field for all drugs in september except when our health plan clients mandate the use of awp as reported by fdb  our contracts with pharmacies in our retail network and our health plan clients generally cite awp as reported by medispan  national drug data file  as a pricing source for brand name and certain generic drugs 
since  most of our contracts with our clients and retail pharmacies contained terms that enabled us to mitigate the adverse effect of the reduction in reported awps  and even those clients without such terms agreed to mitigate the adverse effect of the reduced awp due to the practical need of preserving a widely accessible network of pharmacy providers 
however  the longer term impact of the settlement could create disruption in our business due to the adverse impact on awp based pharmacy pricing and pharmacy efforts to negotiate another drug pricing measure  such as average manufacturer price  amp  or wholesale acquisition cost  wac 
we believe that payors  pharmacy providers and pbms have begun to evaluate other pricing benchmarks as the basis for contracting for prescription drugs and benefit management services in the future 
we believe our business model can utilize one or more other consistently calculated benchmarks  but we cannot evaluate the overall financial impact that the transition to any such alternative benchmark might have 
due to these and other uncertainties  we can give no assurance that the long term impact of changes to industry pricing benchmarks will not have a material adverse effect on our financial performance  results of operations  financial condition or cash flows in future periods 
the federal medicaid rebate statute provides that pharmaceutical manufacturers must provide rebates on all drugs purchased by the medicaid program 
manufacturers of brand name pharmaceuticals must provide the medicaid program a rebate equivalent to the greater of of amp  the average price for products sold to wholesalers  or the difference between amp and the best price given to customers other than the medicaid program  with certain exceptions 
we negotiate rebates with and services payments from drug manufacturers 
investigations have been commenced by certain government agencies which question whether amps and best 
table of contents prices  and thus medicaid rebates  were properly calculated  reported and paid by the manufacturers to the medicaid programs 
we are not responsible for such calculations  reports or payments 
some pharmaceutical manufacturers may view the medicaid rebate statute and or the associated investigations as a disincentive to offer rebates and discounts to private parties  including pbms  and this may adversely affect our ability to negotiate manufacturer rebates in the future 
certain aspects of cms s amp regulations  such as the public disclosure of amp data  could potentially affect our ability  or the ability of intermediaries we may use  to negotiate manufacturer administrative fees and rebates in the future 
increased transparency resulting from the amp publication requirements also could affect the rates at which our pharmacies are reimbursed and the rates our plans pay us for pharmacy claims  but we cannot predict at this time whether the effect of such possible changes will be positive or negative 
the final amp regulation was preliminarily enjoined in december  with respect to the public reporting of amp and the use of amp in the medicaid federal upper limit determination  due to ongoing litigation by the national community pharmacists association and the national association of chain drug stores 
on november   cms published a final rule withdrawing and amending the amp regulations 
the regulations were withdrawn as a result of the retail pharmacies legal challenges and due to the passage of the health care reform legislation which effectively superseded the amp provisions 
cms has not proposed any regulations interpreting the health care reform statutory changes 
nor has it issued substantive sub regulatory guidance on the new methods for determining amp 
cms has indicated that interpretive regulations are forthcoming 
until that time  manufacturers are instructed by cms to rely on the language of the statute as amended by the health care reform laws 
in response to these actions by cms  in december  the litigation between cms and the national community pharmacists association and the national association of chain drug stores was dismissed 
in addition to these potential pricing developments on the federal level  some states have adopted so called most favored nation legislation providing that a pharmacy participating in the state medicaid program must give the state the lowest price that the pharmacy makes available to any third party plan 
such legislation may adversely affect our ability to negotiate discounts in the future from network pharmacies 
voluntary industry ethical guidelines 
the pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america encourages its members to comply with a voluntary ethical code titled phrma code on interactions with healthcare professionals 
this code  which is generally voluntary but has the force of law in a growing number of states  including california  massachusetts  and nevada  provides guidance relating to several facets of pharmaceutical manufacturers marketing practices  particularly with respect to payments to providers 
we believe that these ethical guidelines do not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial operations or cash flows 
future regulation 
we are unable to predict accurately what additional federal or state legislation or regulatory initiatives may be enacted in the future relating to our businesses or the health care industry in general  or what effect any such legislation or regulations might have on us 
for example  the federal government and several state governments have proposed legislation aimed primarily at improving quality of care provided to individuals in managed care plans 
some of the initiatives propose providing greater access to drugs not included on health plan formularies  giving participants the right to sue their health plan for malpractice and mandating an appeals or grievance process 
there can be no assurance that federal or state governments will not impose additional restrictions or adopt interpretations of existing laws that could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
laws and regulations specifically related to our mail order pharmacy operations we operate mail order facilities in alabama and ohio for certain of our customers 
the alabama facility principally fills hospice related prescriptions 
the ohio facility fills prescriptions for all other clients electing to be served by that facility 
in addition to laws and regulations discussed above that may affect mail order pharmacy operations  we are subject to state and federal statutes and regulations governing the operation of pharmacies  repackaging of drug products and dispensing of controlled substances 

table of contents regulation of controlled substances 
our mail order facilities must register with the united states drug enforcement administration and individual state controlled substance authorities in order to dispense controlled substances 
federal law requires us to comply with the dea s security  recordkeeping  inventory control and labeling standards in order to dispense controlled substances 
state controlled substance law requires registration and compliance with state pharmacy licensure  registration or permit standards promulgated by the state pharmacy licensing authority 
state licensure laws 
we are licensed to do business as a pharmacy in ohio and alabama and as a non resident pharmacy in each state where registration with the state board of pharmacy or similar governing body is required so that pharmaceuticals may be delivered by mail into the state 
also  some states require that an out of state pharmacy employ a pharmacist that is licensed in the state into which pharmaceuticals are shipped 
we believe we are in substantial compliance with state licensure and registration requirements with respect to our mail order facilities 
other regulations 
federal law prohibits the restocking and double billing of prescription drugs in connection with the medicaid program 
additionally  the federal trade commission  or ftc  regulates advertising by mail order pharmacies and requires such facilities to stock a reasonable supply of a product sold  to fill mail orders within days and to provide customer refunds where appropriate 
the ftc has also interpreted its authority broadly  as exemplified by a june ftc case settled by cvs caremark rx  alleging privacy and patient record violations 
in addition  the fda sets standards for the packaging of prescription drugs 
federal and state anti remuneration laws also apply to our mail order pharmacy 
we believe we are in substantial compliance with state and federal requirements pertaining to our mail order pharmacy operations 
employees as of december   we had  employees whose services are devoted full time to catalyst health solutions  inc and its subsidiaries 
we have never had a work stoppage 
our personnel are not represented by any collective bargaining unit 
we consider our relations with our personnel to be good 
our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to continue to attract  retain and motivate highly qualified technical and managerial personnel  for whom competition is intense

risk factors risks related to economic conditions unprecedented economic conditions have and are likely to continue to affect our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
unprecedented national and global market and economic conditions that began in have been and continue to be challenging with high unemployment  tighter credit conditions and minimal economic recovery in most major economies 
continued concerns about the systemic impact of potential long term and wide spread recession  energy costs  geopolitical issues  the availability and cost of credit  and the global housing and mortgage markets have contributed to increased market volatility and diminished expectations for the us and many other economies 
these factors have lead to a decrease in spending by businesses and consumers alike  which may adversely affect our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows  to the extent it impacts the liquidity and financial condition of our customers  reduces the extent to which employers are able to offer pharmacy benefits or reduces the number of employees receiving pharmacy benefits through their employer 

table of contents risks related to our business the enactment and implementation of health care reforms could have a materially adverse effect on the manner in which we operate our business and affect our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
in  the patient protection and affordable care act and a reconciliation measure  the health care and education reconciliation act of  were signed into law 
these statutes  or the health care law  require significant changes in the manner in which health insurance coverage is administered and made available in the united states  including applicable pharmacy benefits 
the health care law contains pbm transparency provisions that will require pbms like us to report a variety of financial information to the federal government  including pricing  rebate  and discount information  which will be made publicly available by the federal government 
while we have historically operated our business in a transparent manner with respect to our clients  there can be no assurance that the public availability of commercial financial information from all pbms will not adversely alter the discounts  rebates  and fees that pbms including us can negotiate in the commercial marketplace 
beyond the provisions directly applicable to pbms  the health care law contains broad provisions designed to alter the structure of the market for health insurance  and changes in the health insurance market as a whole will impact the market for our pharmacy benefit management services 
the health care law defines qualifying health benefits packages  including applicable prescription drug coverage  to be offered by employers or to be obtained by individuals through insurance exchanges 
the health care law also contains a variety of requirements applicable to health insurers and pharmaceutical manufacturers  including the elimination of pre existing condition exclusions and annual and lifetime maximum limits  restrictions on the extent to which policies can be rescinded  establishment of minimum medical cost ratios  the imposition of new and significant taxes on health insurers and health care benefits  and annual fees payable by pharmaceutical manufacturers on brand drugs 
many provisions of the health care law become effective at various dates through  and the impact of the health care law remains uncertain pending promulgation of applicable regulations and implementation of the health care law by health insurers  healthcare providers  pharmaceutical manufacturers  and federal and state authorities 
there can be no assurance that the new regulations and implementation of the health care law will not disrupt the market for our pbm services over the next several years  including through our clients reducing or delaying the purchase of pbm services  clients seeking to reduce administrative fees and expenses paid to pbms  and manufacturers reducing rebates or reducing supplies of certain products 
such market disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition  or cash flows 
competition in our industry is intense and could reduce or eliminate our profitability 
the pbm industry is very competitive 
pbm companies compete primarily on the basis of price  service  reporting capabilities and clinical services 
if we do not compete effectively  our business  results of operations  financial condition or cash flows could suffer 
the industry is highly consolidated and dominated by a few large  profitable  well established companies with significant financial and marketing resources  purchasing power and other competitive advantages that we do not have 
scale is a particularly important factor in negotiating prices with pharmacies and drug manufacturers 
a limited number of firms  including national and regional pbm companies such as medco health solutions  inc  cvs caremark rx  inc  and express scripts  inc  have an aggregate market share of approximately of prescription volume 
our competitors also include drug retailers  physician practice management companies and insurance companies health maintenance organizations 
some of our services  such as disease management services  informed decision counseling services and medical information management services  also compete with those being offered by pharmaceutical manufacturers  specialized disease management companies and information service providers 
we may also experience competition from other sources in the future 
we are dependent on a group of key customers  and if we lose key clients as a result of competitive bidding for contracts or contract renewals  consolidation of clients or otherwise  our business  profitability  and growth prospects could suffer 
we depend on a group of clients for a significant portion of our revenue 
our top twenty clients generated approximately of our revenue for the year ended december   including approximately from wellmark blue cross blue shield of iowa and approximately from the state of maryland 
in addition  we generated approximately of our revenue for the three and a half months ended december  from independence blue cross  following our acquisition of futurescripts llc on september  our agreement 
table of contents with wellmark blue cross blue shield terminates in and our agreement with independence blue cross terminates in  subject in both cases to the client s right to terminate earlier for breach or if we are unable to provide competitive pricing 
our agreement with the state of maryland terminates on june  the clients comprising our top twenty clients may change periodically  based on volume  acquisitions  and other factors 
substantially all of our contracts with our clients are entered into for a specific term  generally three years  and as a result  on average at any time  one third of our revenue for the preceding twelve months is attributable to agreements that are up for renewal and re bid over the upcoming twelve months 
in addition  substantially all of our contracts with our clients are subject to early termination if either party breaches the agreement 
as contracts with our clients approach their termination date  our clients either seek to extend the agreement with us for a specified period  or seek competitive bids from us and other providers for a new agreement 
competitive bidding requires costly and time consuming efforts and  even after we have won such bidding processes  we can expend significant time and effort in proceedings or litigation contesting the adequacy or fairness of these bidding processes 
historically  we have successfully retained the business of more than of our clients who had contracts scheduled to expire at the beginning of a calendar year or with whom we entered into a competitive re bid during a calendar year 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will successfully extend expiring agreements with our clients  that we will win any competitive bid to renew such agreements  or that we will be able to improve or maintain our historic retention rate of existing business 
our business  financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows could be materially adversely affected if we fail to extend or win competitive renewals with a significant number of our top clients 
in addition  over the past several years  self funded employers  tpas and other managed care companies have experienced significant consolidation 
consolidations generally reduce the number of clients who may need our services  and can result in our clients being acquired by companies that may not renew  and in some instances may terminate  the acquired client s contract with us 
if a significant number of our key clients are acquired by  or acquires  companies with which we do not have contracts  or if the financial condition of a significant number of our key clients otherwise deteriorates  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
if we lose pharmacy network affiliations  our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows could suffer 
our operations are dependent to a significant extent on our ability to obtain discounts on prescription purchases from retail pharmacies that can be utilized by our clients and their members 
our contracts with retail pharmacies  which are non exclusive  are generally terminable by either party on short notice 
if one or more of our top pharmacy chains elects to terminate its relationship with us or if we are only able to continue our relationship on terms less favorable to us  access to retail pharmacies by our clients and their health plan members  and consequently our business  results of operations  financial condition or cash flows could suffer 
in addition  several large retail pharmacy chains either own or have strategic alliances with pbms or could attempt to acquire or enter into these kinds of relationships in the future 
ownership of  or alliances with  pbms by retail pharmacy chains  particularly large pharmacy chains  could have material adverse effects on our relationships with those retail pharmacy chains  particularly the discounts they are willing to make available  and on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
if we lose relationships with one or more key pharmaceutical manufacturers or rebate intermediaries  or if rebate payments we receive from pharmaceutical manufacturers or intermediaries decline  our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows could suffer 
we receive rebates from rebate intermediaries and numerous pharmaceutical manufacturers based on the use of selected drugs by members of health plans sponsored by our clients  as well as fees for other programs and services 
we believe our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows could suffer if we lose relationships with one or more key pharmaceutical manufacturers or rebate intermediaries  we are unable to finalize rebate contracts with one or more key pharmaceutical manufacturers for or are unable to negotiate interim arrangements  
table of contents rebates decline due to the failure of our health plan sponsors to meet market share or other thresholds  or due to the failure of rebate intermediaries to meet thresholds imposed on them by pharmaceutical manufacturers  legal restrictions are imposed on the ability of pharmaceutical manufacturers or rebate intermediaries to offer rebates or purchase our programs or services  pharmaceutical manufacturers choose not to offer rebates or purchase our programs or services or those of rebate intermediaries with whom we have arrangements  or rebates decline due to contract branded products losing their patents 
over the next few years  as patents expire covering many brand name drugs that currently have a substantial market share  generic products will be introduced that may substantially reduce the market share of these brand name drugs 
historically  manufacturers of generic drugs have not offered formulary rebates on their drugs 
our profitability could be adversely affected if the use of newly approved  brand name drugs added to formularies does not offset any decline in use of brand name drugs whose patents expire 
changes in industry pricing benchmarks could adversely affect our financial performance 
contracts in the prescription drug industry  including our contracts with our retail pharmacy networks and with our pbm clients  as well as our mail order pharmacy reimbursement rates  generally use certain published benchmarks to establish pricing for prescription drugs 
these benchmarks include awp  amp and wholesale acquisition cost  or wac 
most of our contracts utilize the awp standard 
recent events  including litigation involving first databank and medispan  have raised uncertainties as to whether payors  pharmacy providers  pbms and others in the prescription drug industry will continue to utilize awp as it has previously been calculated or whether other pricing benchmarks will be adopted for establishing prices within the industry 
additionally  cms regulations regarding the medicaid amp calculation could potentially impact our ability to negotiate rebates and discounts  as well as our retail pharmacy network and mail order pricing and pbm client contracts 
because we are awaiting revised final regulations and updated guidance from cms  we are unable to predict whether and to what extent the updated cms amp regulation will impact our business 
thus far  our business has not been materially adversely affected by the amp regulations 
these matters are discussed in detail under business government regulation combined federal and state laws  regulations and other standards affecting our business legislation and litigation affecting drug prices  above 
we believe that payors  pharmacy providers and pbms are in the process of evaluating other pricing benchmarks as the basis for contracting for prescription drugs and benefit management services in the future 
due to these and other uncertainties  we can give no assurance that the long term impact of changes to industry pricing benchmarks will not have a material adverse effect on our financial performance  results of operations  financial condition or cash flows in future periods 
if our business continues to grow rapidly and we are unable to manage this growth  our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows could suffer 
our business has grown rapidly since  in part due to acquisitions  with total annual pbm revenue increasing from million in to billion in our business strategy is to continue to seek to expand our operations  including through possible acquisitions 
if we are unable to finance continued growth  manage future expansion or hire and retain the personnel needed to manage our business successfully  then our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 
our growth in operations has placed significant demands on our management and other resources  which is likely to continue 
under these conditions  it is important for us to retain our existing management and to attract  hire and retain additional highly skilled and motivated officers  managers and employees 

table of contents if we are unable to manage potential problems and risks related to future acquisitions  our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows could suffer 
part of our growth strategy includes making acquisitions involving new markets and complementary products  services  technologies and businesses 
if we are unable to overcome the potential problems and inherent risks related to such future acquisitions  our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows could suffer 
our ability to continue to expand successfully through acquisitions depends on many factors  including our ability to identify acquisition prospects and negotiate and close transactions 
even if we complete future acquisitions we could fail to successfully integrate the operations  services and products of an acquired company  there could be inconsistencies in standards  controls  procedures and policies among the companies being combined or assimilated which would make it more difficult to implement and harmonize company wide financial reporting  accounting  billing  information technology and other systems  we may experience difficulties maintaining the quality of products and services that acquired companies have historically provided  we could be required to amortize the identifiable intangible assets of an acquired business  which will reduce our net income in the years following its acquisition  and we also would be required to reduce our net income in future years if we were to experience an impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets attributable to an acquisition  we could be exposed to unanticipated liabilities of acquired businesses  our management s attention could be diverted from other business concerns  and we could lose key employees or customers of the acquired business 
there are risks associated with integrating and operating newly acquired businesses 
we can give no assurance that if we do acquire any new business organizations in the future  we will successfully operate and integrate them 
many companies compete for acquisition opportunities in the pbm industry 
most of our competitors are companies that have significantly greater financial and management resources than we do 
this may reduce the likelihood that we will be successful in completing acquisitions necessary to the future success of our business 
our level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to grow our business  our credit ratings and profile  and the covenants and restrictions in our credit facilities could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may incur substantial indebtedness under our credit facilities  particularly to fund future acquisitions  and our level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition 
in such an event  we would be required to devote a portion of our cash flows from operating activities to service our indebtedness  and such cash flows would therefore not be available for other corporate purposes 
we have million outstanding under our term loan facility 
we also have the ability under our credit facilities to draw upon our million revolver  and an additional million of term loan or revolving loan debt if certain conditions are satisfied under our credit facilities including the agreement of current or new lenders to extend additional credit to us 
we may also seek additional debt financing to fund part of our growth strategy of making acquisitions 
our level of indebtedness may adversely impact our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or other general corporate purposes  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to the payment of interest on our indebtedness  subject us to the risk of increased sensitivity to interest rate increases based upon variable interest rates  including our borrowings if any under our revolving credit facility  
table of contents increase the possibility of an event of default under the financial and operating covenants contained in our debt instruments  and limit our ability to adjust to rapidly changing market conditions  reducing our ability to withstand competitive pressures and make us more vulnerable to a downturn in general economic conditions of our business than our competitors with less debt 
the operating and financial restrictions and covenants contained in the agreements governing our outstanding and future indebtedness may limit our ability to finance future operations or capital needs  borrow additional funds for development and make certain investments 
for example  our credit facilities restrict our ability to  among other things incur additional debt or issue guarantees  incur or permit certain liens to exist  make certain investments  acquisitions or other restricted payments  modify our organizational documents  dispose of assets  engage in certain types of transactions with affiliates  and merge  consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of our assets 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt obligations  we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt facilities  or to obtain additional financing and facilities 
however  we may not be able to obtain any such refinancing or additional facilities on favorable terms or at all 
if we become subject to liability claims that are not covered by our insurance policies  we may be liable for damages and other expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
various aspects of our business may subject us to litigation and liability for damages 
these include  but are not limited to  the performance of pbm services  the operation of our call centers and web site  and the potential for dispensing errors in the operation of our mail order pharmacies 
a successful product or professional liability claim in excess of our insurance coverage where we are required to pay damages  incur legal costs or face negative publicity could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition or cash flows  our business reputation and our ability to attract and retain clients  network pharmacies  and employees 
while we intend to maintain professional and general liability insurance coverage at all times  we cannot provide assurances that we will be able to maintain insurance in the future  that insurance will be available on acceptable terms or that insurance will be adequate to cover any or all potential product or professional liability claims 
disruption of our point of sale information system and transaction processing system  which relies on third parties  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
our operations utilize an electronic network connecting over  retail pharmacies to process third party claims 
this system is provided by a third party adjudication vendor 
because claims are adjudicated in real time  systems availability and reliability are key to meeting customers service expectations 
any interruption in real time service  either through systems availability or telecommunications disruptions can significantly damage the quality of service we provide 
our pbm services also depend on third party proprietary software to perform automated transaction processing 
there can be no assurance that our business will not be harmed by service interruptions or software performance problems 
the failure by our health plan clients to pay for prescription claims or a delay in payment of those claims could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
our contracts with retail pharmacies which participate in our network generally obligate us to make payments for prescription claims even if we are not reimbursed by our clients 
if our clients delay their reimbursement payments or fail to make payments for prescription claims  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 

table of contents if we fail to comply with complex and rapidly evolving laws and regulations  we could suffer civil and or criminal penalties  lose clients  be required to pay substantial damages and make significant changes to our operations 
during the past several years  the us health care industry has been subject to an increase in governmental regulation at both the federal and state levels 
we are subject to numerous federal and state regulations 
if we fail to comply with existing or future applicable laws and regulations  we could suffer civil or criminal penalties 
we must devote significant operational and managerial resources to comply with these laws and regulations 
although we believe that we substantially comply with all existing statutes and regulations applicable to our business  different interpretations and enforcement policies of these laws and regulations could subject our current practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make significant changes to our operations 
in addition  we cannot predict the impact of future legislation and regulatory changes on our business or assure you that we will be able to obtain or maintain the regulatory approvals required to operate our business 
among the legislation and government regulations that could affect us as a provider of pbm services are the regulatory matters discussed in detail in under business government regulation  above  specifically including medicare part d laws and regulation  federal anti remuneration fraud and abuse laws  federal statutes prohibiting false claims  erisa regulation  fda regulation  antitrust regulation  health care reform legislation  state anti remuneration false claims laws  state consumer protection laws  state comprehensive pbm regulation  network access legislation  state legislation affecting plan or benefit design  state regulation of financial risk plans  state discount drug card regulation  privacy and confidentiality legislation  legislation and litigation affecting drug prices  voluntary industry ethical guidelines  and future legislation or regulatory initiatives 
we are subject to potential lawsuits under erisa and the potential liabilities associated with being found to be a fiduciary of a health plan governed by erisa 
as a service provider to erisa plans  we are subject to potential litigation under erisa claims and could face potential liabilities if we are found to be acting as a fiduciary of a plan in carrying out the services for which we are under contract 
while we do not believe that the general conduct of our business subjects us to the fiduciary obligations set forth by erisa  except when we have specifically contracted with an erisa plan sponsor to accept fiduciary responsibility and be named as a fiduciary for certain functions  recent litigation has revealed uncertainties with respect to whether  and under what circumstances  courts will find pbms to be acting as plan fiduciaries 
the potential impact of erisa liability on our business operations is more fully described in the detailed discussion of erisa regulation under business government regulation federal laws and regulations affecting our business erisa regulation  above 
medicare part d laws subject us to certain regulations and scrutiny  even in our limited roles as a subcontractor and mail service provider to part d plans 
the medicare part d program is continuing to evolve  and there are still many uncertainties presented by the program  which is one of the reasons we have opted not to directly sponsor a pdp 
however  we do contract with medicare part d plans  as described under business government regulation  above 
in the limited capacity of a subcontractor and as a mail service provider  we are indirectly subject to certain regulatory requirements  as more fully described in the detailed discussion of medicare part d laws and regulations and its potential implications under business government regulation  above 
we face significant competition in attracting and retaining talented employees 
further  managing succession and retention for our chief executive officer and other key executives is critical to our success  and our failure to do so could have an adverse impact on our future performance 
we believe that our ability to retain an experienced workforce and our ability to hire additional qualified employees is essential to meet current and future goals and objectives 
however  there is no guarantee that we will be able to attract and retain such employees 
an inability to retain existing employees or attract additional employees could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our sources of funds are primarily cash flows from operating activities 
we have in the past also raised funds by borrowing on bank debt and selling equity in the capital markets to fund specific acquisition opportunities 
during the last several years  we have generated positive cash flow from operations and anticipate similar results in at december   our cash and cash equivalents were million 
the net increase of million in our cash and cash equivalents since the end of fiscal resulted primarily from cash used in investing activities offset by proceeds from our term loan facility  as described below 
on august   we entered into new senior credit facilities consisting of a revolving credit facility and term loan facility 
the term loan facility has a principal amount of million 
our revolving credit facility has a principal amount of million 
each of our revolving credit facility and our term loan facility matures on august  in addition to the revolving credit facility and term loan facility  our new senior credit facilities permit us to incur up to million in total principal amount of additional term loan or revolving loan indebtedness under the senior credit facilities

we anticipate repaying this term loan facility through our operating cash flows 
as previously disclosed  we were exploring and pursuing alternatives for obtaining relief from the unanticipated temporary illiquidity of our auction rate securities ars holdings  including seeking relief from entities involved in investing our funds in ars

on may   the arbitration panel ruled in our favor  finding credit suisse liable and requiring credit suisse to pay us million  representing the par value of the remaining outstanding ars in our credit suisse investment account on the date of the ruling 
these ars in our credit suisse investment account were transferred to credit suisse 
we currently have remaining million at par value in investments related to ars 
although we continue to receive timely interest payments  our ars investments currently lack short term liquidity and are therefore classified as non current on our balance sheet 
for each of our ars  we evaluate the risks related to the structure  collateral and liquidity and estimate the fair value of the securities using a discounted cash flow model based on a the underlying structure of each security  b the present value of future principal and interest payments discounted at rates considered to reflect current market conditions  and c considerations of the probabilities of redemption or auction success for each period 
based on the results of these assessments  we recorded temporary impairment charges in accumulated other comprehensive income of thousand through december  to reduce the value of our ars classified as available for sale securities 
effective april   we adopted the authoritative guidance which amended the other than temporary impairment model for debt securities 
under this new guidance  other than temporary impairment must be recognized through earnings if an investor has the intent to sell the debt or if it is more likely than not that the investor will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis 
however  even if an investor does not expect to sell a debt security  it must evaluate expected cash flows to be received and determine if a credit loss has occurred 
in the event of a credit loss  only the amount of the impairment associated with the credit loss is recognized in income 
the amount of the impairment relating to other factors is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
the guidance also requires additional disclosures regarding the calculation of the credit loss and the factors considered in reaching a conclusion that an investment is not other than temporarily 
table of contents impaired

critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements 
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
our estimates and assumptions are based upon a combination of historical information and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the particular circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
certain of the accounting policies which most impact our consolidated financial statements and that require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments are described below 
see also note summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k

rebates receivable and payable rebates earned under arrangements with manufacturers or third party intermediaries are predominately recorded as a reduction of direct expenses 
the portion  which in some cases may be the full amount  of such rebates due to clients is recorded as a reduction of revenue

the company estimates its rebates receivable and rebates payable based on the number and type of claims submitted  the rebate program terms with its clients  the company s rebate contracts with pharmaceutical manufacturers and third party intermediaries  and other information that may be available 
the amount of rebates actually received by the company  and rebates paid to its clients  is impacted by a variety of factors  including the validation of claims data submitted by the company and differences between estimated and actual rebatable products 
as a result  the company s actual experience relative to rebates received by the company  and rebates paid to its clients  may result in adjustments to the estimates made in prior periods 
during  the company adjusted its prior estimates related to rebates receivable and rebates payable by million and million  respectively 
the impact of adjustments in rebates receivable and rebates payable estimates for the years ended december  and were not material 
future adjustments to the amounts of rebates receivable and rebates payable outstanding are possible and the impact  although not expected to be  could be material 

table of contents allowance for accounts receivable trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest 
the allowance for accounts receivable is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable 
we determine the allowance based on historical write off experience by industry and regional economic data 
we review our allowance for accounts receivable quarterly 
account balances are charged off against the allowance when we feel it is probable the receivable will not be recovered 
we do not have any off balance sheet credit exposure related to our customers 
assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations in our acquisitions  we are required to make judgments regarding the fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed 
for significant acquisitions  management has engaged consultants to assist it in estimating the fair values of acquired intangible assets 
intangible assets we do not have any intangible assets with indefinite lives 
we do have other intangible assets subject to amortization  and these assets are amortized straight line over months to years  depending on each intangible asset s estimated useful life 
the estimated fair value and the weighted average useful life of the intangible assets are based on income method valuation calculations 
the remaining useful life of intangible assets is evaluated periodically and adjusted as necessary to match the period that the assets are expected to provide economic benefits 
goodwill our goodwill is not amortized  but is tested for impairment at least annually 
we performed our annual goodwill impairment testing at december  and concluded that no goodwill impairment exists because the fair values of our reporting units are substantially in excess of their carrying values 
we test for impairment of goodwill according to a two step approach 
in the first step  we test for impairment of goodwill by estimating the fair values of our reporting units using a present value of future cash flows approach 
although we operate in one reportable segment  for the purposes of performing this impairment test under the accounting standards  we have identified three reporting units 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
in the second step  the implied fair value of the goodwill is estimated as the fair value of the reporting unit used in the first step less the fair values of all other net tangible and intangible assets of the reporting unit 
if the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair market value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess  not to exceed the carrying amount of the goodwill 
in addition  the goodwill of a reporting unit is tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
investments the company s investments  which consist primarily of auction rate securities ars  and are recorded at fair market value  with unrealized gains losses  net of taxes  reported as a separate component of shareholders equity 
realized gains losses and amounts representing credit losses  of which there were none  are included in other income 
for purposes of determining any credit loss  the company assesses the fair value of its ars under the single best estimate approach 
although we continue to receive timely interest payments and there have been instances of recent redemptions of our auction rate securities by issuers at par  our ars investments currently lack short term liquidity and therefore are classified as non current on our balance sheet 
aggregate investments outstanding at december  were million 
the impact of changes to their valuation is not expected to be material 

table of contents income taxes our deferred income taxes are determined based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities given the provisions of enacted tax laws 
deferred income tax provisions and benefits are based on changes to the assets or liabilities from year to year 
in providing for deferred taxes  we consider tax regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate  estimates of future taxable income  and available tax planning strategies 
if tax regulations  operating results or the ability to implement tax planning strategies vary  adjustments to the carrying value of deferred tax assets and liabilities may be required 
valuation allowances  if any  are recorded related to deferred tax assets based on the more likely than not criteria 
we recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit 
for tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold  the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority 
we may from time to time be assessed interest or penalties by major tax jurisdictions  although any such assessments historically have been minimal and immaterial to our financial results 
our policy is that we recognize interest and penalties accrued on any unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense 
new accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a final accounting standards update asu that sets forth revised goodwill impairment guidance for reporting units that have a zero or negative carrying amount 
for these reporting units  the fasb concluded that step of the test should be performed if qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill impairment exists 
for public entities  this new guidance is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  early adoption is not permitted 
we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have an impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in january  the fasb issued a final asu that sets forth additional requirements and guidance regarding disclosures of fair value measurements 
the asu requires the gross presentation of activity within the level fair value measurement roll forward and details of transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements 
it also clarifies two existing disclosure requirements within the current fair value authoritative guidance on the level of disaggregation of fair value measurements and disclosures on inputs and valuation techniques 
the new requirements and guidance were effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december   which for us meant the beginning of our fiscal year  except for the level roll forward requirements which is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december   which for us means our first quarterly period ending on march  the adoption of the disclosures effective in did not have an impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
additionally  we do not expect the adoption of the disclosures which were deferred until the first quarter of to have an impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued guidance that changed the consolidation model for variable interest entities vies 
this guidance requires companies to qualitatively assess the determination of the primary beneficiary of a vie based on whether a company has the power to direct matters that most significantly impact the activities of the vie and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie 
this standard is effective at the beginning of our fiscal year 
the adoption of the standard did not have an impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we believe we have minimal market risk inherent in our financial position 
we do not have any derivative financial instruments and do not hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
our market risk primarily represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market interest rates 
our results from operations could be impacted by decreases in interest rates on our cash and cash equivalents 
additionally  we may be exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates related to our term loan facility and any debt that may be outstanding under our revolving credit facility 

table of contents we do not expect our business  results of operations  financial position or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates 
at december   we had million of long term debt obligations which were subject to variable interest rates under our senior credit facilities 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates of would result in an increase in our annual interest expense of approximately million pre tax  presuming obligations subject to variable interest rates remained constant 
we operate our business within the united states and puerto rico and execute all of our transactions in us dollars and therefore do not have any foreign currency exchange risk
