table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in item of this form k  which is incorporated herein by reference 
overview we provide auto loans to consumers regardless of their credit history 
our product is offered through a nationwide network of automobile dealers who benefit from sales of vehicles to consumers who otherwise could not obtain financing  from repeat and referral sales generated by these same customers  and from sales to customers responding to advertisements for our product  but who actually end up qualifying for traditional financing 
for the year ended december   consolidated net income was million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  for the same period in and million  or per diluted share  for the same period in the growth in consolidated net income was primarily due to an increase in the size of our loan portfolio and an improvement in the performance of our loan portfolio 
the growth in consolidated net income was primarily due to an improvement in the performance of our loan portfolio  higher yields on new consumer loan assignments  and an increase in the size of our loan portfolio 
critical success factors critical success factors include our ability to access capital on acceptable terms  accurately forecast consumer loan performance  and maintain or grow consumer loan volume at the level and on the terms that we anticipate  with an objective to maximize economic profit 
economic profit is a financial metric we use to evaluate our financial results and determine incentive compensation 
economic profit measures how efficiently we utilize our total capital  both debt and equity  and is a function of the return on capital in excess of the cost of capital and the amount of capital invested in the business 
access to capital our strategy for accessing capital on acceptable terms needed to maintain and grow the business is to maintain consistent financial performance  maintain modest financial leverage  and maintain multiple funding sources 
our funded debt to equity ratio is as of december  we currently utilize the following primary forms of debt financing a revolving secured line of credit with a commercial bank syndicate  revolving secured warehouse facilities with institutional investors  term abs financings with qualified institutional investors  and senior notes 
consumer loan performance at the time the consumer loan is submitted to us for assignment  we forecast future expected cash flows from the consumer loan 
based on these forecasts  an advance or one time purchase payment is made to the related dealer partner at a price designed to achieve an acceptable return on capital 
if consumer loan performance equals or exceeds our original expectation  it is likely our target return on capital will be achieved 

table of contents we use a statistical model to estimate the expected collection rate for each consumer loan at the time of assignment 
we continue to evaluate the expected collection rate of each consumer loan subsequent to assignment 
our evaluation becomes more accurate as the consumer loans age  as we use actual performance data in our forecast 
by comparing our current expected collection rate for each consumer loan with the rate we projected at the time of assignment  we are able to assess the accuracy of our initial forecast 
the following table compares our forecast of consumer loan collection rates as of december   with the forecasts as of december   as of december   and at the time of assignment  segmented by year of assignment forecasted collection percentage as of variance in forecasted collection percentage from consumer loan assignment year december  december  december  initial forecast december  december  initial forecast consumer loans assigned in    and have performed better than our initial expectations while consumer loans assigned in   and have performed worse 
during the year ended december   forecasted collection rates increased for consumer loans assigned in and  decreased for consumer loan assignments  and were generally consistent with expectations at the start of the period for the other assignment years 
forecasting collection rates precisely at loan inception is difficult 
with this in mind  we establish advance rates that are intended to allow us to achieve acceptable levels of profitability  even if collection rates are less than we currently forecast 
the following table presents forecasted consumer loan collection rates  advance rates  the spread the forecasted collection rate less the advance rate  and the percentage of the forecasted collections that had been realized as of december  all amounts  unless otherwise noted  are presented as a percentage of the initial balance of the consumer loan principal interest 
the table includes both dealer loans and purchased loans 
as of december  consumer loan assignment year forecasted collection advance spread of forecast realized represents advances paid to dealer partners on consumer loans assigned under our portfolio program and one time payments made to dealer partners to purchase consumer loans assigned under our purchase program as a percentage of the contractual amounts of the consumer loans 
payments of dealer holdback and accelerated dealer holdback are not included 
presented as a percentage of total forecasted collections 

table of contents the risk of a material change in our forecasted collection rate declines as the consumer loans age 
for and prior consumer loan assignments  the risk of a material forecast variance is modest  as we have currently realized in excess of of the expected collections 
conversely  the forecasted collection rates for more recent consumer loan assignments are less certain as a significant portion of our forecast has not been realized 
the spread between the forecasted collection rate and the advance rate declined during the through period as we increased advance rates during this period in response to a more difficult competitive environment 
during and  the spread increased as the competitive environment improved  and we reduced advance rates 
in addition  during  the spread was positively impacted by better than expected consumer loan performance 
we increased advance rates during the last four months of  the first quarter of  and the fourth quarter of the decline in the spread for reflects these increases 
the following table presents forecasted consumer loan collection rates  advance rates  and the spread the forecasted collection rate less the advance rate as of december  for dealer loans and purchased loans separately 
all amounts are presented as a percentage of the initial balance of the consumer loan principal interest 
consumer loan assignment year forecasted collection advance spread dealer loans purchased loans represents advances paid to dealer partners on consumer loans assigned under our portfolio program and one time payments made to dealer partners to purchase consumer loans assigned under our purchase program as a percentage of the contractual amounts of the consumer loans 
payments of dealer holdback and accelerated dealer holdback are not included 
the advance rates presented for each consumer loan assignment year change over time due to the impact of transfers between dealer and purchased loans 
under our portfolio program  certain events may result in dealer partners forfeiting their rights to dealer holdback 
we transfer the dealer partner s consumer loans from the dealer loan portfolio to the purchased loan portfolio in the period this forfeiture occurs 
although the advance rate on purchased loans is higher as compared to the advance rate on dealer loans  purchased loans do not require us to pay dealer holdback 

table of contents consumer loan volume the following table summarizes changes in consumer loan assignment volume in each of the last quarters as compared to the same period in the previous year year over year percent change three months ended unit volume dollar volume march  june  september  december  march  june  september  december  march  june  september  december  represents advances paid to dealer partners on consumer loans assigned under our portfolio program and one time payments made to dealer partners to purchase consumer loans assigned under our purchase program 
payments of dealer holdback and accelerated dealer holdback are not included 
consumer loan assignment volumes depend on a number of factors including the overall demand for our product  the amount of capital available to fund new loans and our assessment of the volume that our infrastructure can support 
our pricing strategy is intended to maximize the amount of economic profit we generate  within the confines of capital and infrastructure constraints 
our success in renewing our debt facilities and securing additional financing during and positioned us to grow year over year unit volumes 
during the last four months of  the first quarter of  and the fourth quarter of  we increased advance rates  which had a positive impact on unit volumes 
while the advance increases also reduced the return on capital we expect to earn on new assignments  we believe it is very likely the advance increases had a positive impact on economic profit 
unit volume for the one month ended january  increased by as compared to the same period in

finance charges 
for the year ended december   finance charges increased million  or  as compared to the increase was the result of an increase in the average yield on our loan portfolio and an increase in the average net loans receivable balance  as follows dollars in thousands for the years ended december  change average yield on our loan portfolio average net loans receivable balance the following table summarizes the impact each component had on the increase in finance charges for the year ended december  in thousands for the year ended impact on finance charges december  due to an increase in the average yield due to an increase in the average net loans receivable balance total increase in finance charges the increase in the average yield on our loan portfolio for the year ended december  was due to improvements in forecasted collection rates on loans assigned in and as well as higher yields on consumer loans assigned during the first quarter of the increase in the average net loans receivable balance was primarily due to growth in new loan volume throughout premiums earned 
for the year ended december   premiums earned decreased million  or  as compared to the decrease was primarily due to a decline in the size of our reinsurance portfolio  which resulted from the termination of our arrangement with one of our third party insurers during the fourth quarter of prior to the fourth quarter of  vsc re reinsured vehicle service contracts that were underwritten by two of our three third party insurers 
vsc re currently reinsures vehicle service contracts that are underwritten by one of our two third party insurers 

table of contents other income 
for the year ended december   other income increased million  or  as compared to the increase in other income was primarily a result of million of income recognized during the second quarter of related to an arrangement with one of our third party vehicle service contract providers 
this arrangement was discontinued in and no additional income is expected beyond the amount recognized to date 
while we continue to generate income from vehicle service contracts  such amounts are captured through vsc re and recorded over the life of the contracts as premiums earned less provision for claims 
salaries and wages 
for the year ended december   salaries and wages decreased million  or  as compared to the same period in the decrease was primarily the result of reduced expenses related to stock compensation due to the timing of expense related to long term incentive compensation  reduced expenses related to information technology primarily due to an approximately reduction in information technology headcount  partially offset by the expensing of internal information technology salaries during the third quarter of that were previously capitalized as software developed for internal use  and reduced expenses related to collections primarily due to efficiencies realized through the implementation of strategic initiatives and fewer delinquent accounts which reduce the amount of collection effort 
these decreases were partially offset by increased expenses related to medical claims and an increase in our k matching contributions 
general and administrative 
for the year ended december   general and administrative expense decreased million  or  as compared to the decrease primarily resulted from decreased legal costs  decreased consulting fees primarily related to the internal revenue service irs examination which is now complete  decreased sales tax expense  and decreased depreciation expense primarily related to a reduction in capital expenditures  partially offset by increased consulting fees primarily related to the development of software 
sales and marketing 
for the year ended december   sales and marketing expense increased million  or  as compared to the same period in the increase was due primarily to the expansion of our field sales force and increased sales commissions resulting from an increase in the commission per consumer loan assignment and an increase in the number of consumer loan assignments 
provision for credit losses 
for the year ended december   the provision for credit losses increased million  or  as compared to under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  when forecasted future cash flows decline relative to the cash flows expected at the time of assignment  a provision for credit losses is recorded immediately as a current period expense and a corresponding allowance for credit losses is established 
for purposes of calculating the required allowance  dealer loans are grouped by dealer partner and purchased loans are grouped by month of purchase 
as a result  regardless of the overall performance of the portfolio of consumer loans  a provision can be required if any individual loan pool performs worse than expected 
conversely  a previously recorded provision can be reversed if any previously impaired individual loan pool experiences an improvement in performance 
during the year ended december   overall consumer loan performance exceeded our expectations at the start of the period 
however  impaired loan pools within our portfolio experienced net declines in forecasted cash flows  resulting in provision for credit losses of million for the year ended december  during the year ended december   overall consumer loan performance also exceeded our expectations at the start of the period 
consistent with the overall performance of the portfolio  impaired loan pools experienced net improvements in forecasted cash flows  resulting in a reversal of provision for credit losses of million for the year ended december

provision for claims 
for the year ended december   provision for claims increased million  or  as compared to the increase was due to an increase in claims paid per reinsured vehicle service contract  partially offset by a decline in the size of our reinsurance portfolio 
provision for income taxes 
for the year ended december   the effective tax rate decreased to  from compared to the decrease was primarily due to the reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions and associated interest as a result of the completion of the irs examination during the second quarter of and adjustments to our state tax liability

premiums earned 
for the year ended december   premiums earned increased million  or  as compared to the increase was the result of our formation of vsc re during the fourth quarter of we formed vsc re in order to enhance our control over and the security in the trust assets that are used to pay future vehicle service contract claims 
prior to october   vsc re reinsured vehicle service contracts that were underwritten by two of our three third party insurers 
effective october   we terminated our arrangement with one of our three third party insurers 
vsc re currently reinsures vehicle service contracts that are underwritten by one of our two third party insurers 
premiums from the reinsurance of vehicle service contracts are recognized over the life of the policy in proportion to expected costs of servicing those contracts 
expected costs are determined based on historical claims experience 
a provision for claims is recognized in the period the claims are incurred 
the amount of income we earn from the vehicle service contracts over time is not impacted by the formation of vsc re  as both before and after the formation  the income we recognize  excluding our commissions  is based on the amount by which vehicle service contract premiums exceed claims 
however  the formation of vsc re impacts the timing of income recognition and the income statement presentation 
prior to the formation of vsc re  our agreements with vehicle service contract tpas allowed us to receive profit sharing payments depending upon the performance of the vehicle service contract programs 
profit sharing payments were received periodically  primarily during the first quarter of each year  and were recognized on a net basis premiums earned less claims incurred as other income in the period received 
premiums earned for the year ended december  include million of revenue related to a revision in our revenue recognition timing 
we revised our revenue recognition timing in order to better match the timing with our expected costs of servicing those contracts 
other income 
for the year ended december   other income decreased million  or  as compared to the decrease was primarily the result of the formation of vsc re  as discussed above  which eliminated the profit sharing arrangements related to vehicle service contracts  except for vehicle service contracts written prior to through one of the tpas 
for the year ended december   we earned million related to vehicle service contract profit sharing payments compared to million for the same period in decreased interest income on restricted cash related to the secured financings due to a decrease in interest rates earned on cash investments relating to secured financing transactions and a decrease in the average outstanding balance 
for the year ended december   we earned million in interest income related to secured financings compared to million for the same period in decreased gap profit sharing payments resulting from an increase in gap claims paid as a percentage of premiums written 
for the year ended december   we received million in gap profit sharing payments compared to million for the same period in 
table of contents salaries and wages 
for the year ended december   salaries and wages expense decreased million  or  as compared to the decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in expense related to information technology 
an increased percentage of loan underwriting costs being deferred due to an increase in dealer loan unit volume as a percentage of total unit volume 
for dealer loans  certain underwriting costs are considered dealer loan origination costs and are deferred and expensed over the life of the dealer loan as an adjustment to finance charge revenue while  for purchased loans  all underwriting costs are expensed immediately 
since dealer loans represent a larger proportion of total unit volume during as compared to the same period in prior year  the deferral was higher for the year ended december   as compared to these items were partially offset by an increase of stock based compensation expense primarily due to the grant of restricted stock awards during general and administrative 
for the year ended december   general and administrative expense increased million  or  as compared to primarily resulting from increased legal costs and expenses related to the ongoing examination by the irs 
sales and marketing 
for the year ended december   sales and marketing expense decreased million  or  as compared to the decrease was primarily due to lower sales commissions reflecting a decrease of in consumer loan unit volume for the year ended december  and the discontinuance of certain dealer partner support programs and lower utilization of various other dealer partner programs 
provision for credit losses 
for the year ended december   the provision for credit losses decreased million  or  as compared to the decrease was the result of an improvement in the performance of our loan portfolio 
during the year ended december   forecasted collection rates increased on previously impaired loan pools and as a result  a portion of this increase was recognized as a reversal of previously recorded provision for credit losses 
during the second quarter of  as a result of lower than expected realized collection rates  we reduced estimated future net cash flows by million  or of the total undiscounted net cash flow stream expected from our loan portfolio  which resulted in a provision for credit losses of million 
during the fourth quarter of  we reduced estimated future net cash flows by an additional million  or of the total undiscounted net cash flow stream expected from our loan portfolio 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of  we revised the estimated timing of future collections to reflect reduced prepayment expectations as a result of recent trends 
the fourth quarter of forecast modifications resulted in a provision for credit losses of million 
interest 
for the year ended december   interest expense decreased million  or  as compared to the following table shows interest expense  the average outstanding debt balance and the pre tax average cost of debt for the years ended december  and dollars in thousands for the years ended december  interest expense average outstanding debt balance pre tax average cost of debt for the year ended december   the decrease in interest expense was due to a reduction in the average outstanding debt balance and a reduction in our pre tax average cost of debt due to reductions in market rates 
the reductions in market rates were slightly offset by less favorable pricing on our revolving credit facilities 
provision for claims 
for the year ended december   provision for claims increased million  or  as compared to the increase was the result of our formation of vsc re during the fourth quarter of as discussed above in premiums earned 

table of contents provision for income taxes 
for the year ended december   the effective tax rate decreased to  from in the decrease was primarily due to the decrease in the reserve for uncertain tax positions recorded during the third and fourth quarters of critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we review our accounting policies  assumptions  estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with gaap 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k  which is incorporated herein by reference 
we believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results  and involve a high degree of subjective or complex judgment  and the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce materially different financial results 
finance charge revenue allowance for credit losses balance sheet captions loans receivable allowance for credit losses income statement captions finance charges provision for credit losses nature of estimates required estimating the amount and timing of future collections and dealer holdback payments 
assumptions and approaches used for accounting purposes  we are not considered to be an originator of consumer loans  but instead are considered to be a lender to our dealer partners for consumer loans assigned under our portfolio program  and a purchaser of consumer loans assigned under our purchase program 
as a result of this classification  our accounting policies for recognizing finance charge revenue and determining our allowance for credit losses may be different from other lenders in our market  who  based on their different business models  may be considered to be a direct lender to consumers for accounting purposes 
for additional information regarding our classification as a lender to our dealer partners for accounting purposes  see note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k  which is incorporated herein by reference 

table of contents we recognize finance charges under the interest method such that revenue is recognized on a level yield basis based upon forecasted cash flows 
for dealer loans  finance charge revenue and the allowance for credit losses are calculated after first aggregating dealer loans outstanding for each dealer partner 
for the same purpose  purchased loans are aggregated according to the month the loan was purchased 
an allowance for credit losses is maintained at an amount that reduces the net asset value loan balance less the allowance to the value of forecasted future cash flows discounted at the yield established at the time of assignment 
the discounted value of future cash flows is comprised of estimated future collections on the loans  less any estimated dealer holdback payments related to dealer loans 
we write off loans once there are no forecasted future collections on any of the associated consumer loans 
actual cash flows from any individual dealer loan or pool of purchased loans are often different than estimated cash flows at the time of assignment 
if such difference is favorable  the difference is recognized prospectively into income over the remaining life of the dealer loan or pool of purchased loans through a yield adjustment 
if such difference is unfavorable  a provision for credit losses is recorded immediately as a current period expense and a corresponding allowance for credit losses is established 
because differences between estimated cash flows at the time of assignment and actual cash flows occur often  an allowance is required for a significant portion of our loan portfolio 
an allowance for credit losses does not necessarily indicate that a dealer loan or pool of purchased loans is unprofitable  and in recent years  very seldom are cash flows from a dealer loan or pool of purchased loans insufficient to repay the initial amounts advanced or paid to the dealer partner 
future collections on dealer and purchased loans are forecasted based on the historical performance of consumer loans with similar characteristics  adjusted for recent trends in payment patterns 
dealer holdback is forecasted based on the expected future collections and current advance balance of each dealer loan 
key factors variances in the amount and timing of future collections and dealer holdback payments from current estimates could materially impact earnings in future periods 
a decline in the forecasted future net cash flows on loans as of december  would have reduced net income by approximately million

assumptions and approaches used premiums from the reinsurance of vehicle service contracts are recognized over the life of the policy in proportion to the expected costs of servicing those contracts 
expected costs are determined based on our historical claims experience 
in developing our cost expectations  we stratify our historical claims experience into groupings based on contractual term  as this characteristic has led to different patterns of cost incurrence in the past 
we will continue to update our analysis of historical costs under the vehicle service contract program as appropriate  including the consideration of other characteristics that may have led to different patterns of cost incurrence  and revise our revenue recognition timing for any changes in the pattern of our expected costs as they are identified 
premiums earned for the year ended december  include million of revenue related to a revision in our revenue recognition timing 
we revised our revenue recognition timing during the third quarter of in order to better match the timing with our expected costs of servicing those contracts 
key factors variances in the pattern of future claims from our current estimates would impact the timing of premiums recognized in future periods 
a change in premiums earned for the year ended december  would have affected net income by approximately million

table of contents uncertain tax positions balance sheet captions income taxes receivable accounts payable and accrued liabilities income statement caption provision for income taxes nature of estimates required estimating the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return 
assumptions and approaches used we follow a two step approach for recognizing uncertain tax positions 
first  we evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
second  for positions that we determine are more likely than not to be sustained  we recognize the tax benefit as the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being sustained 
we establish a liability for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties 
we adjust this liability in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively settled  the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position  or more information becomes available 
on june   we reached a settlement with the irs which concluded the examination of our federal income tax returns for through and closed the respective years 
as a result of the settlement  we agreed to pay a total of million in federal and state taxes and interest related to these years 
the settlement includes million of taxes that represent an acceleration of taxes already provided for in prior periods and the payment did not have an impact on our net income during the reporting periods 
we also concluded that all through uncertain federal jurisdiction tax positions taken in previous periods are effectively settled and we recorded a reversal of corresponding accrued reserves and interest 
this reversal had a favorable impact of million after tax on our net income for the year ended december  for additional information  see note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k  which is incorporated herein by reference 
key factors to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability  our effective income tax rate in future periods could be materially affected 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we need capital to fund new loans and pay dealer holdback 
our primary sources of capital are cash flows from operating activities  collections of consumer loans and borrowings under a revolving secured line of credit with a commercial bank syndicate  revolving secured warehouse facilities with institutional investors  term abs financings with qualified institutional investors  and senior notes 
there are various restrictive debt covenants for each financing arrangement and we are in compliance with those covenants as of december  for information regarding these financings and the covenants included in the related documents  see note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k  which is incorporated herein by reference 
during the first quarter of  we issued million aggregate principal amount of first priority senior notes 
concurrently with the issuance of the senior notes  we amended the agreements governing our revolving secured line of credit facility with a commercial bank syndicate to facilitate the issuance of the senior notes and future secured indebtedness 
the net proceeds from the offering of the senior notes were used to repay all outstanding borrowings under our revolving secured line of credit facility and to repay all outstanding borrowings under our million revolving secured warehouse facility  subject to our ability to reborrow in each case 
the senior notes were issued pursuant to an indenture  dated as of february  the indenture  among us  bvpp and vehicle remarketing services  inc vrs  as guarantors the guarantors  and us bank national association  as trustee the trustee 
the senior notes mature on february  and bear interest at a rate of per annum  computed on the basis of day year composed of twelve day months and payable semi annually on february and august of each year  beginning on august  the senior notes were issued at of the aggregate principal amount for net proceeds of million  representing a yield to maturity of 
during the second quarter of  we extended the maturity of the revolving secured line of credit facility with a commercial bank syndicate from june  to june  the interest rate on borrowings under the facility was changed from the prime rate plus or the eurodollar rate plus  at the company option  to the prime rate plus or the eurodollar rate plus  at the company option 
the floor on the eurodollar rate decreased from to
