the company had net sales of billion in company performance and guidance in  we continued our focus on improving the customer experience  creating cost and operational improvements and efficiencies  and generating cash flow 
successful execution of our initiatives enabled us to significantly reduce our debt from prior year levels and  as a result of increased excess capacity under our credit facility throughout the year  pay in full our million second lien term loan on january  strategic investments and an improved performance in enable us to begin well positioned to increase the productivity of our store portfolio and online operations through aligned  effective merchandising and marketing strategies 
we have identified near term opportunities for growth and resource optimization  as well as challenges  including general macroeconomic conditions that may affect our customers and our business 
as the consumer environment remains uncertain  we are continuing to plan our business conservatively 
we expect to achieve earnings per diluted share ranging from to 
assumptions in our projections include a comparable store sales increase ranging from to  a gross margin rate ranging from basis points lower to even with the rate of  an sg a expense rate projected to remain flat at  and an effective tax rate of 
in anticipation of pricing pressures on our merchandise costs in  we are leveraging our sourcing capabilities  adjusting our product mix and  where appropriate  selectively increasing prices on those goods that allow for more price elasticity  while maintaining competitive value on highly sensitive commodities 
given these challenges  we are projecting a gross margin rate ranging from basis points lower to even with the rate 
earnings per share guidance does not reflect the potential non cash income tax benefit of reducing the valuation allowance currently recorded for deferred tax assets 
if we achieve results within our earnings guidance  a favorable adjustment to the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets is expected

additionally  investments in our ecommerce business continued to result in higher sales 
we are in the early stages of maximizing opportunities from a strong internet presence and digital marketing capabilities  expansion of multichannel investments is a strategic priority given the potential for driving sales growth both online and in store 
the best performing merchandise categories in the period were footwear  home and better sportswear included in women s apparel 
sales in footwear benefited from the expansion of key updated vendors to an increased number of stores and the strength of incredible value programs 
the home area achieved success in sales of luggage  cold weather items and small electronics 
better sportswear sales increased as customers responded favorably to expanded offerings of trend right fashions from key vendors 
sales of updated  better merchandise throughout our product categories significantly outperformed sales of moderately priced traditional goods during the latter half of  reversing a prior trend 
despite a stronger performance in the fall season of the year  furniture sales included in home were adversely impacted by the challenging housing market and slow economy in coats included in women s apparel achieved success in sales of updated  better merchandise  but was hampered by slower sales in traditional goods 
sales in juniors apparel were impacted by assortments that were deficient in new  novelty looks preferred by our customer  particularly in tops 
other income other income  which includes income from revenues received under our credit card program agreement with hsbc  leased departments and other customer revenues  was million  or of net sales  in as compared with million  or of net sales  in the decrease primarily reflects reduced leased department income  the result of the conversion in late of fine jewelry to an owned department 
costs and expenses gross margin dollars increased million to  million in  compared with  million in  reflecting the increased sales volume and an improvement in the gross margin rate 
the gross margin rate increased basis points to of net sales  primarily due to increased net markup and a reduction in the net markdown rate 
sg a expense decreased million to million in as compared with million in  reflecting the continued execution of our cost savings initiatives as we focused on optimizing our resources and reducing expenses where appropriate 
the expense rate in decreased basis points to of net sales 
depreciation and amortization expense and amortization of lease related interests decreased million  to million in from million in the expense reduction primarily reflects the reduced asset base as a result of significant reductions in capital expenditures in and whereby depreciation expense greatly exceeded asset additions and  to a lesser extent  asset impairments recorded in and in  we recorded million of non cash asset impairment charges which resulted in a reduction in the carrying amount of certain store and distribution center properties 
we recorded charges of million for similar asset impairments in see notes and in the notes to consolidated financial statements

see notes and in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest expense  net net interest expense in was million  or of net sales  as compared with million  or of net sales  in the million increase primarily reflects higher borrowing rates and amortization of deferred financing fees under our amended and new credit facilities  partially offset by reduced borrowings throughout the year and interest rate swap ineffectiveness in income tax provision benefit the effective tax rate in largely reflects the company s valuation allowance position against all net deferred tax assets 
the million income tax provision in includes certain state income tax expense and recognition of deferred tax liabilities associated with indefinite lived assets  offset in part by a favorable million tax benefit adjustment related to expiration of certain tax exposures 
an income tax benefit of million was recorded in  primarily due to deferred tax asset valuation allowance releases associated with implementation of the carry back provisions of the worker  homeownership  and business assistance act of compared with net sales net sales in were  million  a decrease of from  million in comparable store sales decreased from the prior year 
we believe sales were depressed throughout primarily due to wavering consumer confidence and numerous economic factors that negatively impacted consumers discretionary spending 
additionally  due to inventory management efforts  there was significantly less clearance inventory throughout compared with the prior year  further challenging sales 
the best performing merchandise categories in the period were moderate sportswear included in women s apparel and accessories 
sales in moderate sportswear benefited from what we believe was a shift in our customers spending patterns in response to the economic situation in as our moderate offerings provided the value our customers were seeking 
sales increases in accessories also reflect favorable customer response to trend right  value priced private brand and branded product 
similar success in sales of moderate goods was achieved throughout all families of business 
the poor performances of better sportswear included in women s apparel and furniture included in home also suggest our customers were spending their limited discretionary dollars on more moderately priced merchandise 
better sportswear was the most difficult business in women s apparel in  as economic conditions and the loss of several key branded vendors challenged sales 
furniture sales continued to be adversely impacted by the difficult housing market and continued deterioration in consumer spending for bigger ticket items 
other income other income was million  or of net sales  in as compared with million  or of net sales  in the decrease was primarily due to reduced sales volume and reduced income associated with our proprietary credit card program 
proprietary credit card income decreased as a result of lower sales volume as well as an amendment to the credit card program agreement with hsbc 
other income was reduced by million in pursuant to the amended agreement with hsbc  which revised the compensation the company receives for certain types of credit sales and provided that the company and hsbc will share certain losses associated with the credit card program 
costs and expenses despite the decrease in sales volume  we effectively managed our inventory throughout such that gross margin dollars increased million to  million  compared with  million in the increase in gross margin dollars reflects an improvement in the gross margin rate of basis points  primarily due to a reduction in the net markdown rate 
gross margin as a percentage of sales increased to in from in the prior year 
sg a expense decreased million to million in as compared with  million in  reflecting the successful execution of our cost savings initiatives 
the decrease primarily resulted from expense reductions in payroll and advertising in response to our sales trend 
the expense rate in decreased basis points to of net sales  compared with in depreciation and amortization expense and amortization of lease related interests decreased million  to million in from million in  primarily due to the reduced asset base resulting from significant asset impairment charges recorded in the fourth quarter of and reduced capital expenditures 
in the second quarter of  we recorded a non cash charge of million to fully impair our goodwill 
see notes and in the notes to consolidated financial statements

see notes and in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest expense  net net interest expense in was million  or of net sales  as compared with million  or of net sales  in the million increase primarily reflects interest expense associated with interest rate swaps and the new term loan  deferred fees as a result of the amended and new credit facilities and the ineffectiveness of the interest rate swaps  partially offset by decreased borrowing levels and reduced interest rates in the first three quarters of income tax benefit provision an income tax benefit of million was recorded in  primarily due to deferred tax asset valuation allowance releases associated with implementation of the carry back provisions of the worker  homeownership  and business assistance act of this compares favorably with an income tax provision of million in the income tax provision included an unfavorable million tax expense adjustment in the fourth quarter of pursuant to establishment of an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets and a favorable million tax benefit adjustment in the third quarter of related to expiration of certain exposures 
non gaap financial measure ebitda we have prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
in addition  the non gaap financial performance measure of ebitda defined as earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  including amortization of lease related interests  goodwill and other impairment charges is as follows in thousands ebitda we consider ebitda to be an important supplemental measure of our performance 
it is frequently used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties to evaluate the performance of companies in our industry and by some investors to determine a company s ability to service or incur debt 
in addition  our management uses ebitda internally to compare the profitability of our stores 
ebitda is not calculated in the same manner by all companies and accordingly is not necessarily comparable to similarly entitled measures of other companies and may not be an appropriate measure for performance relative to other companies 
ebitda should not be assessed in isolation from or construed as a substitute for net income or cash flows from operations  which are prepared in accordance with gaap 
ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool and is not intended to represent  and should not be considered to be a more meaningful measure than  or an alternative to  measures of operating performance as determined in accordance with gaap 
the following table reconciles net income loss as presented in our consolidated statements of operations prepared in accordance with gaap to ebitda in thousands net income loss adjustments income tax provision benefit interest expense  net depreciation and amortization amortization of lease related interests goodwill impairment other impairment charges ebitda liquidity and capital resources at january   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million available under our revolving credit facility before taking into account the minimum borrowing availability of million  which compares favorably with the million available at january  we generated significant operating cash flow in  allowing us to reduce our debt by million  or  and invest in business initiatives 
on january   we utilized million of excess availability under our revolving credit facility to pay in full our second lien term loan  which was scheduled to mature on november  on march   we entered into a million senior secured second amended revolving credit facility which expires march   subject to the maturity of the senior unsecured notes and certain other debt of the company 
the second amended revolving credit facility replaced our pre existing million revolving credit facility  which was scheduled to mature on june  the proceeds of the second amended revolving credit facility were used to pay the outstanding balance under the revolving credit facility and will be used for other general corporate purposes 
the second amended revolving credit facility has interest rate reductions and generally favorable revisions regarding the facility requirements and financial covenant 
in anticipation of protracted economic uncertainty  in we will continue our focus on effective cash management and maintaining a strong balance sheet with ample liquidity 
we believe these actions will positively impact our cash flow 
typically  cash flows from operations are impacted by consumer confidence  weather in the geographic markets served by the company  and economic and competitive conditions existing in the retail industry  a downturn in any single factor or a combination of factors could have a material adverse impact upon our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to operate our business 
while the current economic uncertainty affects our assessment of short term liquidity  we consider our resources cash flows from operations supplemented by borrowings under the credit facility adequate to satisfy our cash needs 
while there can be no assurances  management believes there will be sufficient liquidity to cover our short term funding needs 
our primary sources of working capital are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
our business follows a seasonal pattern  working capital fluctuates with seasonal variations  reaching its highest level in october or november to fund the purchase of merchandise inventories prior to the holiday season 
the seasonality of our business historically provides greatest cash flow from operations during the holiday season  with fiscal fourth quarter net sales generating the strongest profits of our fiscal year 
as holiday sales significantly reduce inventory levels  this reduction  combined with net income  historically provides us with strong cash flow from operations at the end of our fiscal year 
cash provided by used in our operating  investing and financing activities is summarized as follows dollars in millions operating activities investing activities financing activities the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in  as compared with  primarily reflects increased working capital requirements  namely  increases in merchandise inventories and a contribution to the company s pension plan 
a year to year comparison of working capital is also greatly impacted by the receipt of a prior year million income tax receivable versus the receipt of a prior year million income tax receivable  both due to carry back provisions 
the decrease in cash provided in was partially offset by the significant improvement in the current year business performance  resulting in net income in versus the prior year s net loss 
the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in  as compared with  primarily reflects improvement in our business performance 
additionally  analysis of working capital changes in the periods is impacted by the cash receipt of a million income tax receivable 
we invested million  million and million in capital expenditures not reduced by landlord contributions in  and  respectively  primarily for the opening  expanding and remodeling of stores and investments in information technology 
in  significant investment was made in technology and infrastructure to support our growing ecommerce business 
particularly in and  we restricted our capital expenditures in response to economic conditions  improvement in our operating performance has enabled us to budget capital expenditures of approximately million net of approximately million of landlord contributions in projects include ongoing store expansions and remodels  strategic initiatives in pilot stores  and continued information technology investments to enhance our online presence and selling tools 
we believe these investments will drive continued growth and profitable returns 
the decrease in net cash used in financing activities in  as compared with  primarily reflects reduced net debt payments as borrowing levels were lower throughout the year and cash flow generated in was used to support cash requirements for increased capital expenditures and forfeitures of common stock shares by associates in lieu of tax payments 
in addition  financing fees were reduced in the increase in net cash used in financing activities in  as compared with  primarily reflects utilization of cash flow to reduce debt in credit arrangements on march   the bon ton department stores  inc  the elder beerman stores corp  carson pirie scott ii  inc  bon ton distribution  inc  and mcril  llc  as borrowers the borrowers  and the company and certain other subsidiaries as obligors together with the borrowers and the company  the obligors entered into the second amended revolving credit facility with bank of america  na  as agent  and certain financial institutions as lenders that amends and restates the revolving credit facility entered into on december   which was an amendment and restatement of the loan and security agreement entered into on march  the revolving credit facility

these purchase orders do not contain any significant termination payments or other penalties if cancelled 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
preparation of these financial statements required us to make estimates and judgments that affected reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to merchandise returns  the valuation of inventories  long lived assets  intangible assets  insurance reserves  contingencies  litigation and assumptions used in the calculation of income taxes and retirement and other post employment benefits  among others 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially lead to materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe our critical accounting policies are as described below 
for a discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies  see the notes to consolidated financial statements 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined by the retail inventory method 
under the retail inventory method  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margin is derived by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
the retail inventory method is an averaging method that is widely used in the retail industry 
use of the retail inventory method will result in valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market if markdowns are taken timely as a reduction of the retail value of inventories 
inherent in the retail inventory method calculation are certain significant management judgments and estimates including  among others  merchandise markups  markdowns and shrinkage  which significantly impact both the ending inventory valuation at cost and the resulting gross margin 
these significant estimates  coupled with the fact that the retail inventory method is an averaging process  can  under certain circumstances  result in individual inventory components with cost above related net realizable value 
factors that can lead to this result include applying the retail inventory method to a group of products that is not fairly uniform in terms of its cost  selling price relationship and turnover  or applying the retail inventory method to transactions that include different rates of gross profit  such as those relating to seasonal merchandise 
in addition  failure to take timely markdowns can result in an overstatement of inventory under the lower of cost or market principle 
we believe that the retail inventory method we use provides an inventory valuation that approximates cost and results in carrying inventory in the aggregate at the lower of cost or market 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record an adjustment for excess or old inventory based primarily on an estimated forecast of merchandise demand for the selling season 
demand for merchandise can fluctuate greatly 
a significant increase in the demand for merchandise could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  estimates of future merchandise demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the adjustment required for excess or old inventory 
if our inventory is determined to be overvalued in the future  we would be required to recognize such costs in costs of goods sold and reduce operating income at the time of such determination 
likewise  if inventory is later determined to be undervalued  we may have overstated the costs of goods sold in previous periods and would recognize additional operating income when such inventory is sold 
therefore  although every effort is made to ensure the accuracy of forecasts of merchandise demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or in economic conditions within our markets could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and reported operating results 
as of january  and january   approximately and  respectively  of our inventories were valued using a first in  first out cost basis and approximately and  respectively  of our inventories were valued using a last in  first out lifo cost basis 
as is currently the case with many companies in the retail industry  our lifo calculations yielded inventory increases due to deflation reflected in price indices used 
the lifo method values merchandise sold at the cost of more recent inventory purchases which the deflationary indices indicated to be lower  resulting in the general inventory on hand being carried at the older  higher costs 
given these higher values and the promotional retail environment  we have reduced the carrying value of our lifo inventories to an estimated realizable value 
these reductions totaled million and million as of january  and january   respectively 
inherent in the valuation of inventories are significant management judgments and estimates regarding future merchandise selling costs and pricing 
should these estimates prove to be inaccurate  we may have overstated or understated our inventory carrying value 
in such cases  operating results would ultimately be impacted 
vendor allowances as is standard industry practice  allowances from merchandise vendors are received as reimbursement for charges incurred on marked down merchandise 
vendor allowances are recorded when determined to be collectable and authorized by internal management 
allowances are credited to costs of goods sold  provided the allowance is for merchandise permanently marked down or sold  not predicated on a future purchase  and not predicated on a future increase in the purchase price from the vendor 
if the aforementioned criteria are not met  the allowances are recorded as an adjustment to the cost of merchandise capitalized in inventory and reflected as a reduction of costs of merchandise sold when the related merchandise is sold 
additionally  allowances are received from vendors in connection with cooperative advertising programs and for reimbursement of certain payroll expenses 
these allowances are reviewed to ensure reimbursements are for specific  incremental and identifiable advertising or payroll costs incurred to sell the vendor s products 
if a vendor reimbursement exceeds the costs incurred  the excess reimbursement is recorded as a reduction of cost purchases from the vendor and reflected as a reduction of costs of merchandise sold when the related merchandise is sold 
all other amounts are recognized as a reduction of the related advertising or payroll costs that have been incurred and reflected in sg a expense 
income taxes significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and the valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
the process involves summarizing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheet 
in addition  we are required to assess whether valuation allowances should be established against our deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not standard 
to the extent a valuation allowance is established in a period  an expense must generally be recorded within the income tax provision in the statement of operations 
we reported net deferred tax liabilities of million and million at january  and january   respectively 
in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets  we considered whether it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized based upon all available evidence  including scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  historical operating results  projected future operating results  tax carry back availability and limitations pursuant to section of the internal revenue code  among others 
significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
as a result  current or previous losses are given more weight than any projected future taxable income 
in addition  a recent three year historical cumulative loss is considered a significant element of negative evidence that is difficult to overcome 
we evaluate our deferred tax assets each reporting period  including assessment of the company s cumulative income or loss over the prior three year period  to determine if valuation allowances are required 
with respect to our review for the fourth quarter of  a significant element of negative evidence considered was our three year historical cumulative loss as of the fourth quarter of this  combined with uncertain near term economic conditions  impeded our ability to rely on our projections of future taxable income in establishing the deferred tax assets valuation allowance at january  accordingly  a nearly full valuation allowance was established on our net deferred tax assets during the fourth quarter of with respect to our reviews during and  our three year historical cumulative loss and the continuation of uncertain near term economic conditions impeded our ability to rely on our projections of future taxable income in assessing valuation allowance requirements 
as such  we concluded it was necessary to continue the position of a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets 
our deferred tax asset valuation allowance totaled million and million at january  and january   respectively 
if actual results differ from these estimates or these estimates are adjusted in future periods  the valuation allowance may need to be adjusted  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
if sufficient positive evidence arises in the future indicating that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets meet the more likely than not standard for realization  the valuation allowance would be reduced accordingly in the period that such a conclusion is reached 
if reduced  a maximum of million of the valuation allowance reduction would result in an increase to paid in capital rather than an income tax benefit 
we recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained 
recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than likely of being realized 
changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs 
interpretations and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time  and changes to our assumptions and judgments could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
long lived assets property  fixtures and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of such assets 
changes in our business model or capital strategy can result in the actual useful lives differing from estimates 
in cases where we determined the useful life of property  fixtures and equipment should be shortened  we depreciated the net book value in excess of the salvage value over the revised remaining useful life  thereby increasing depreciation expense 
factors such as changes in the planned use of fixtures or leasehold improvements could also result in shortened useful lives 
our net property  fixtures and equipment amounted to million and million at january  and january   respectively 
we are required to test a long lived asset for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance of stores relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of assets or overall business strategy  and significant negative industry or economic trends for a sustained period 
if the undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset are insufficient to support the recorded asset  an impairment loss is recognized for the amount if any by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
cash flow estimates are based on historical results  adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions 
estimates of fair value are determined through various techniques  including discounted cash flow models and market approaches  as considered necessary 
should cash flow estimates differ significantly from actual results  an impairment could arise and materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
given the seasonality of operations  impairment is not conclusive  in many cases  until after the holiday period in the fourth quarter is concluded 
newly opened stores may take time to generate positive operating and cash flow results 
factors such as store type  store location  current marketplace awareness of private label brands  local customer demographic data and current fashion trends are all considered in determining the time frame required for a store to achieve positive financial results 
if conditions prove to be substantially different from expectations  the carrying value of new stores long lived assets may ultimately become impaired 
we evaluated the recoverability of our long lived assets and  as a result  in and we recognized asset impairment charges of million and million  respectively  which resulted in a reduction in the carrying amount of certain store and distribution center properties 
in  we recorded asset impairment charges of million  which resulted in a reduction in the carrying amount of certain store properties 
these analyses anticipate certain economic conditions 
should economic conditions be worse than anticipated  additional impairment charges could result 
goodwill and intangible assets net intangible assets totaled million and million at january  and january   respectively 
our intangible assets at january  are principally comprised of million of lease interests that relate to below market rate leases and million associated with trade names  private label brand names and customer lists 
the lease related interests are being amortized using a straight line method 
the customer lists are being amortized using a declining balance method 
at january   lease related interests and customer lists had average remaining lives of years and eight years  respectively  for amortization purposes 
at january   trade names and private label brand names of million have been deemed as having indefinite lives 
intangible assets that have indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment at least annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values 
fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis  which requires certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors 
our policy is to conduct impairment testing based on our most current business plans  which reflect anticipated changes in the economy and the industry 
we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million in the second quarter of based upon our review  the fair value of our single reporting unit  estimated using a combination of our common stock trading value as of the end of the second quarter of  a discounted cash flow analysis and other generally accepted valuation methodologies  was less than the carrying amount 
the charge reduced the balance of goodwill to zero at january  no adjustment was required pursuant to our review of the carrying amount of intangible assets in as a result of our review in  we recorded an asset impairment charge of million related to a reduction in the value of two indefinite lived private label brand names 
in  we recognized asset impairment charges of million and million on indefinite lived trade names and private label brand names  respectively 
should significant changes in the manner of our use of assets or overall business strategy  future results or economic events cause us to adjust our projected cash flows  future estimates of fair value may not support the carrying amount of these assets 
if actual results prove inconsistent with our assumptions and judgments  we could be exposed to a material impairment charge 
insurance reserve estimates we use a combination of insurance and self insurance for a number of risks  including workers compensation  general liability and employee related health care benefits  a portion of which is paid by our associates 
we determine the estimates for the liabilities associated with these risks by considering historical claims experience  demographic factors  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
a change in claims frequency and severity of claims from historical experience as well as changes in state statutes and the mix of states in which we operate could result in a change to the required reserve levels 
pension and supplementary retirement plans we provide an unfunded supplementary pension plan to certain key executives 
through acquisitions  we acquired a defined benefit pension plan and assumed the liabilities of three supplementary pension plans and a postretirement benefit plan 
major assumptions used in accounting for these plans include the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on the defined benefit plan s assets 
the discount rate assumption is evaluated annually 
we utilize the citibank pension discount curve cpdc to develop the discount rate assumption 
the cpdc is developed from a us treasury par curve that reflects the treasury coupon and strips market 
option adjusted spreads drawn from the double a corporate bond sector are layered in to develop a double a corporate par curve  from which the cpdc spot rates are developed 
the cpdc spot rates are applied to expected benefit payments  from which a single constant discount rate can then be developed based on the expected timing of these benefit payments 
we base our asset return assumption on current and expected allocations of assets  as well as a long term view of expected returns on the plan asset categories 
we assess the appropriateness of the expected rate of return on an annual basis and  when necessary  revise the assumption 
at january   our target pension plan asset allocation was equity securities and fixed income 
changes in the assumptions regarding the discount rate and expected return on plan assets may result in materially different expense and liability amounts 
actuarial estimations may differ materially from actual results  reflecting many factors including changing market and economic conditions  changes in investment strategies  higher or lower withdrawal rates and longer or shorter life spans of participants 
in addition  while we are not required to make any mandatory contributions to the defined benefit pension plan in  the funded status of this plan and the related cost reflected in our financial statements are affected by various factors that are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty  particularly in the current economic environment 
under the pension protection act of  losses of asset values may necessitate increased funding of the defined benefit pension plan in the future to meet minimum federal government requirements 
downward pressure on the asset values of the defined benefit pension plan may require us to fund obligations earlier than we forecasted  which would have a negative impact on cash flows from operations 
in the first quarter of  we paid million pursuant to the termination of one of our unfunded supplemental pension plans 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk and financial instruments we are exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates 
to provide some protection against potential rate increases associated with our variable rate borrowing facilities  we entered into derivative financial transactions in the form of interest rate swaps 
the interest rate swaps were used to reduce or eliminate the variability of interest payments on the underlying variable rate facilities 
the swaps interest rate differential is reflected as an adjustment to interest expense over the life of the swaps 
upon the expiration of our interest rate swaps in july  we do not anticipate entering into new agreements 
at january   we held two variable to fixed rate swaps with a notional amount of million each 
the notional amount does not represent amounts exchanged by the parties  rather  it is used as the basis to calculate amounts due and to be received under the interest rate swap 
during and  we did not enter into or hold derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
the following table provides information about our derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including debt obligations and the interest rate swaps 
for debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates at january  for the interest rate swaps  the table presents the notional amount and weighted average pay and receive interest rates by expected maturity date 
for additional discussion of our interest rate swaps  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
expected maturity date by year dollars in there thousands after total fair value debt fixed rate debt average fixed rate variable rate debt average variable rate interest rate derivatives interest rate swap variable to fixed average pay rate average receive rate the  variable rate debt in consists of two obligations the  term loan facility  which was scheduled to expire on november  the debt was paid in full on january   and  of borrowings under the revolving credit facility  which was scheduled to expire june  on march   we entered into a second amended revolving credit facility  which is scheduled to expire on march   subject to the maturity of the senior unsecured notes and certain other debt of the company 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
seasonality and inflation our business  like that of most retailers  is subject to seasonal fluctuations  with the major portion of sales and income realized during the second half of each fiscal year  which includes the holiday season 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for the company s quarterly results for and due to the fixed nature of certain costs  sg a expense is typically higher as a percentage of net sales during the first half of each year 
working capital requirements fluctuate during the year as well and generally reach their highest levels during the third and fourth quarters 
because of the seasonality of our business  results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results that may be achieved for a full year 
in addition  quarterly operating results are impacted by the timing and amount of revenues and costs associated with the opening of new stores and the closing and remodeling of existing stores 
we do not believe inflation has had a material effect on operating results during the past three years 
we are  however  beginning to experience inflationary conditions in our merchandise and transportation costs 
in our private brands  where we have more control over the production and manufacturing of the merchandise  we have historically been able to minimize inflationary pressures through measures such as committing earlier for merchandise purchases and shifting production to lower cost markets 
our third party brand vendors are also facing the same inflationary pressures 
we will continue to work with these vendors  as possible  to minimize the impact of inflation on our merchandise costs and our selling prices
