item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year represents results on an aggregated basis that adds the results of the predecessor with those of the successor to help provide a full year presentation of our results for comparability purposes 
for example  the predecessor period from july  to april  pre ipo is combined with the successor period from april to july  post ipo and described as fiscal to present results for the fiscal year ended july  management reviews aggregated results when it analyzes operating trends and results 
these combined results should not be used in isolation or substitution of predecessor and successor results reported separately  and may not be comparable to similarly entitled measures reported by other companies 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations successor period from april  to july  and predecessor period from july  to april  for a separate explanatory discussion on the successor operating performance for the period from april  to july  and for the predecessor operating performance for the period from july  to april  in addition  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations predecessor and successor periods for additional detail regarding the predecessor and successor periods

table of contents sales and marketing the majority of our speech generating devices sold in the united states and abroad are marketed to speech language pathologists 
funding requirements dictate that a licensed speech language pathologist evaluates  recommends  and authorizes the device 
our special education software is typically sold to special education teachers and speech language pathologists at schools 
speech language pathologists are trained  accredited professionals who work with non speaking or speech impaired individuals to assess their needs  improve their ability to communicate and work to provide sources of payment of expenditures related to their condition 
we market our speech generating technologies to speech language pathologists in schools  outpatient rehabilitation centers  select disease clinics  hospitals  freestanding offices and home health agencies 
for our speech generating technologies  we employ a sophisticated  highly trained direct sales force to market our products 
many of our sales representatives are generalists who sell our full range of products to all potential customers in a particular region 
in recent years  we have begun to develop more specialized sales representatives  such as separate sales teams focusing on children and adult specific speech language pathologists  specific institutions such as schools and hospitals or key accounts 
more specialized sales representatives are better able to tailor our sales efforts to the particular needs and concerns of different types of customers 
we currently market our products in the united states  canada  australia  the united kingdom and certain other countries throughout the globe 
in the united states  canada and the united kingdom  we sell our speech generating devices through a direct sales infrastructure focused on speech language pathologists 
we use strategic partnerships with third party distributors to sell our products in the other international markets that we have targeted 
in addition to our sales personnel  we also use direct marketing initiatives to build public awareness of our products

during the fiscal years  and  we incurred research and development expenses of million  million and million  respectively 
intellectual property we own both copyrights and trademarks on pcs  the industry standard symbol set  and we seek to obtain trademark registrations for certain of our products  including boardmaker  dynavox  dynawrite  interaact  tango and dynasyms 
we license our symbol sets to third parties  and in our fiscal year ended july   we received royalties for the use of pcs by other companies of approximately million compared to approximately million in fiscal in recent years  we have begun to make greater use of patent laws to protect our innovations 
we also own intellectual property rights in our software and proprietary technology 

table of contents we seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products through a combination of copyrights  trademarks  patents  trade secret laws and contractual rights 
we also seek to maintain our trade secrets and confidential information through nondisclosure policies  the use of appropriate confidentiality agreements and other security measures 
we have obtained registration for a number of trademarks in the united states and in other countries and have a number of patent applications in the united states pending determination  including a patent related to our eyemax eye tracking technology 
there can be no assurance  however  that our intellectual property rights can be successfully enforced against third parties in any particular jurisdiction 
we license certain software or other intellectual property from third parties to incorporate into our products 
significant licenses include dynasyms symbols  gateway page set  eyetech eye tracking software  microsoft operating systems  at t wizzard voices  acapela voices  loquendo voices and nuance voices 
product assembly the components of our speech generating devices are manufactured by third parties 
the final assembly is performed by our own personnel at our facility in pittsburgh  pennsylvania 
competition we have many competitors in the broader assistive technology and educational software industries 
within our particular areas of speech generating technology and interactive software for students with special educational needs  we believe we are the largest player and have no dominant competitors 
however  additional entrants  including larger technology companies and other assistive technology companies  could also choose to compete with us in these areas 
also  speech generation software applications utilized on hand held tablet computers not specifically designed for this purpose may become more popular and adversely affect sales of our speech generating devices 
third party payors the funding process for a speech generating device in the united states typically involves several steps 
first  the speech language pathologist makes an evaluation and submits the relevant information to the appropriate funding sources 
once we receive the third party payor authorization that the submission is accurate and complete and that the device will be funded according to prescribed funding guidelines  we ship the product directly to the speech language pathologist or end user 
at this point  the funding source becomes responsible for the payment of the product to us 
in some cases  the funding source will require the patient to use a loaner device on a trial basis for a period of time before product funding will be granted 
we do not ship our products  nor recognize revenue  until funding is approved for the end user 
in the united states  as well as in foreign countries  government funded or private insurance programs  commonly known as third party payors  pay the cost of a significant portion of a patient s medical expenses including  in many cases  speech generating technology 
a uniform policy of coverage does not exist among these payors 
therefore  funding can differ from payor to payor 
these third party payors may deny funding if they determine that a device was not used in accordance with cost effective treatment methods  as determined by the third party payor 
there can be no assurance that our products will be considered cost effective by third party payors  that funding will be available or  if available  that the third party payors funding policies will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably 
cms sets coverage policy for the medicare program in the united states 
cms policies may alter coverage and payment related to our speech generating devices in the future 
these changes may occur as the result of national coverage decisions issued by cms directly or as the result of local or regional coverage decisions by contractors under contract with cms to review and make coverage and payment decisions 
cms maintains a national coverage policy  which provides for the utilization of our speech generating technologies by medicare beneficiaries 
medicaid programs are funded by both federal and state governments 
medicaid programs are administered by the states and vary from state to state and from year to year 

table of contents commercial payor coverage for speech generating devices may vary across the united states 
all third party coverage programs  whether government funded or insured commercially  whether inside the united states or outside  are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs through prospective coverage and capitation programs  group purchasing  redesign of benefits  careful review of bills  encouragement of healthier lifestyles and exploration of more cost effective methods of delivering healthcare 
these types of programs and legislative changes to funding policies could potentially limit the amount which healthcare providers may be willing to pay for speech generating technology 
as private insurance tends to follow medicare guidelines  widespread coverage by independent insurers followed the medicare policy adoption 
medicare and private insurance are now two major funding sources for speech generating technology developers  such as us 
medicare and most state medicaid agencies follow a policy allowing the purchase of a device every five years or when a documented change in condition exists 
our special education software authoring tools  the boardmaker family of products  are primarily purchased by a speech language pathologist or special education teacher out of a school s annual budget 
our professionally generated content for our special education software are also generally purchased out of a school s annual budget but are often purchased by a speech language pathologist or special education teacher independently 
government regulation our speech generating technology operations are directly  or indirectly through our customers  subject to various state and federal fraud and abuse laws  including  without limitation  the federal anti kickback statute and false claims act 
these laws may impact  among other things  our proposed sales  marketing and education programs 
the us anti kickback statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting  offering  receiving or providing remuneration  directly or indirectly  in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual  or the furnishing or arranging for a good or service  for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the medicare and medicaid programs 
this statute is normally used to insure that bribes or other illegal remuneration are not paid to physicians  or others  to induce their use of drugs or medical devices 
several courts have interpreted the statute s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business  the statute has been violated 
the anti kickback statute is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry 
many states have also adopted laws similar to the federal anti kickback statute  some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services funded by any source  not only the medicare and medicaid programs 
the us false claims act prohibits persons from knowingly filing or causing to be filed a false claim to  or the knowing use of false statements to obtain payment from  the federal government 
various states have also enacted laws modeled after the federal false claims act 
in addition to the laws described above  the us health insurance portability and accountability act of created two new federal crimes healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters 
the healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program  including private payors 
the false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying  concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false  fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits  items or services 
we believe that we are not subject to regulation by the us food and drug administration fda because our powered communications systems are not intended to be used for a medical purpose  including for communicating directly with medical personnel or to alert authorities regarding a medical condition or emergency and  as such  are not medical devices 
however  if it were determined that our powered communications systems are subject to fda regulation as medical devices  we believe that they would be  in any event  exempt from the fda s k premarket notification requirements 
in such a case  we would be subject to the fda s establishment registration and current good manufacturing practices requirements which we believe  in light of our current manufacturing practices  would not result in an undue burden on us 

table of contents voluntary industry codes  federal guidance documents and a variety of state laws address the tracking and reporting of marketing practices relative to gifts given and other expenditures made to doctors and other healthcare professionals 
in addition to impacting our marketing and educational programs  internal business processes are affected by the numerous legal requirements and regulatory guidance at the state  federal and industry levels 
medicare requires that all durable medical equipment suppliers  including us  undergo an external audit to certify they are operating within good manufacturing principles 
we earned such accreditation  which is effective for a three year period  in may employees as of july   we had full time employees 
none of our employees are represented by a union  and we consider relations with our employees to be satisfactory 
we have employment agreements with all of our executive officers

item a 
risk factors you should carefully read the risks and uncertainties described below 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company 
additional risks and uncertainties may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occurs  our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows would likely suffer 
in that case  the trading price of our class a common stock could fall 
risks related to our business the current adverse economic environment  including the associated impact on government budgets  could adversely affect our business 
in late and early  the us and global economies deteriorated significantly  and although the economic  financial and credit market crises have somewhat abated  they continue to contribute to market turbulence and weakness 
these factors continue to impact global economic conditions  raise heightened concerns about a prolonged global economic recession and have resulted in a significant loss of corporate earnings and consumer spending 
as a result  tax revenue for federal  state and local governments  as well as foreign governments  has decreased substantially 
in response to the reduced revenue  governments have cut funding and may continue to cut funding to public programs  including schools and healthcare 

table of contents we experienced a softening of demand for both our speech generating devices and software products during the first quarter of our fiscal year this softening of demand relative to our prior year continued during the second quarter of fiscal year as net sales for the twenty six weeks ended december  declined compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year 
net sales for our fiscal year third quarter  which ended april   increased compared to the third quarter of fiscal year net sales for our fiscal year fourth quarter  which ended july   decreased compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year overall  fiscal year net sales decreased compared to full fiscal year we continue to believe that reduced domestic government funding  and particularly more constrained state and local government funding of school budgets  is adversely affecting  and may continue to adversely affect  our product sales in the united states 
in addition  we believe that constraints in government spending in the company s key international markets  including canada and the united kingdom  have had  and may continue to have  a similar effect on our product sales in those regions 
the adverse impact of these factors on our net sales generation has been more significant than initially anticipated 
although there were some encouraging signs in the later part of the second quarter and during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year  we have not seen any material improvement in the demand for both our speech generating devices and software products  and we cannot predict when such improvement might occur 
the majority of the funding for purchases of our special education software and content and a significant portion of the funding for purchases of our speech generating devices comes from the budgets of public schools 
our speech generating technology business is also dependent on funding from medicare or medicaid or other state or local government sources 
many state and local government agencies operate under tight budget constraints and make choices on a yearly basis of where to allocate funds 
if government agencies continue to redirect funds from special education programs  medicaid programs or other disability programs to alternative projects  our net sales and results of operations could continue to be adversely affected 
changes in funding for public schools could cause the demand for our speech generating devices  special education software and content to decrease 
we derive a significant portion of both our speech generating devices and our special education software and content revenue from us and non us public schools  which are heavily dependent on federal  state and local  as well as foreign  government funding 
in addition  the school appropriations process is often slow  unpredictable and subject to many factors outside of our control 
curtailments  delays  changes in leadership  shifts in priorities or general reductions in funding could delay or reduce our revenue 
funding difficulties experienced by schools could also cause those institutions to be more resistant to price increases and could slow investments in educational products which could harm our business 
our business may be adversely affected by changes in state educational funding as a result of changes in legislation at the international  federal and state levels  changes in the state procurement process  changes in government leadership  emergence of other priorities and changes in the condition of the local  state  us or global economy 
while in the past few years the availability of state and federal funding for elementary and high school education has improved due to legislation such as no child left behind  recent reductions in  and proposed elimination of  appropriations for these programs may cause some school districts to continue to reduce spending on our products 
reductions in funding for us and us public schools may harm our business if our customers are not able to find and obtain alternative sources of funding 
reforms to the united states healthcare system may adversely affect our business 
significant legislative reforms to the united states healthcare system have recently been enacted 
while we do not expect this legislation to adversely affect our business  it is not certain what form regulations or policies promulgated thereunder could take or what effect such legislation or regulations  or additional future legislative and regulatory changes may have on our business or results of operations 
it is possible that such regulations or policies or future reforms could include programs to reduce spending on healthcare related products  which may include our speech generating technologies 
changes in third party payor funding practices or preferences for alternatives may decrease the demand for  or put downward pressure on the price of  our speech generating devices 
customers for our speech generating devices typically receive funding from various third party payors  including domestic and foreign governmental programs such as medicare and medicaid  private insurance plans and managed care plans 
the ability of our customers to obtain appropriate funding for our speech generating devices from domestic and foreign government and third party payors is critical to our success 
the availability and extent of coverage affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay 
funding varies from country to country and can significantly impact the acceptance of new products 
after we develop a new speech generating device  we may experience limited demand for the product unless funding approval is obtained from private and governmental third party payors in the united states and overseas 

table of contents the us centers for medicare and medicaid services  or cms  established coverage for assistive technologies to address speech impairment in  and since that time most private insurers have added such coverage as well 
payors continue to review their funding polices and can  without notice  deny coverage for our speech generating devices 
additionally  many private third party payors base their funding policy decisions on the decision reached by governmental agencies such as medicare or medicaid 
as a result of this  if medicare or medicaid alters its funding policy in an unfavorable way to us  the effects could be compounded if private insurers followed suit 
cms sets coverage policy for the medicare program in the united states 
cms policies may alter coverage and payment related to our speech generating devices in the future 
these changes may occur as the result of national coverage decisions issued by cms directly or as the result of local or regional coverage decisions by contractors under contract with cms to review and make coverage and payment decisions 
legislative or administrative changes could reduce the availability of third party funding for our speech generating devices 
legislative or administrative changes to the us or international funding systems that significantly reduce funding for our products or deny coverage for our products would have an adverse impact on the number of products purchased by our customers and the prices our customers are willing to pay for them  which would  in turn  adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the loss of members of our senior management or other key personnel or the failure to attract and retain highly qualified personnel could compromise our ability to effectively manage our business and pursue our growth strategy 
we rely on members of our senior management to execute our existing business plans and to identify and pursue new opportunities 
the loss of services of one or more of our key senior managers could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
our future performance depends on the continued service of our key technical  development  sales  marketing and services personnel 
we rely on our technical and development personnel for product innovation 
we rely on our sales and marketing personnel to continue to expand awareness of our products and our customer base 
the loss of key employees could result in significant disruptions to our business  and the integration of replacement personnel could be costly and time consuming  could cause additional disruptions to our business  and could be unsuccessful 
we do not carry key person life insurance covering any of our employees 
our future success also depends on our continued ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical  development  sales and services personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and we may fail to retain our key employees or attract or retain other highly qualified personnel in the future 
recently  employment dislocations among sales and marketing personnel generally  and in the healthcare area specifically  have facilitated our ability to add talented sales personnel to our workforce 
to the extent employment conditions in the economy improve  we may experience difficulty in continuing to attract talented sales personnel  which in turn could adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
we may not be able to develop and market successful new products 
our future success and our ability to increase net sales and earnings depend  in part  on our ability to develop and market new software  devices and content 
our failure to develop new products could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  if any of our new products do not work as planned  our ability to market these products could be substantially impeded  resulting in lost net sales  potential damage to our reputation and delays in obtaining market acceptance of these products 
we cannot assure you that we will continue to successfully develop and market new products 
new disruptive technologies may adversely affect our market position and financial results 
our competitors or companies in related industries could develop new technologies that may reduce our market share and adversely affect our net sales and results of operations 
for example  other companies are seeking to develop technologies to allow a computer to be directly controlled by a human brain 
if a competitor is able to commercialize that technology before we are  our sales of speech generating devices for people with significant physical limitations  such as the 
table of contents eyemax eye tracking device  may be reduced 
also  speech generation software applications utilized on hand held tablet computers not specifically designed for this purpose may become more popular and adversely affect sales of our speech generating devices 
we are dependent on the continued support of speech language pathologists and special education teachers 
the majority of our speech generating technologies sales are made at the recommendation of a speech language pathologist  and the majority of our special education software authoring tools and content are sold to special education teachers 
we are dependent on our ability to convince speech language pathologists and special education teachers of the benefits to their clients and students of our speech generating technologies and special education software 
if speech language pathologists or special education teachers were to instead favor the products of our competitors  damaging our reputation  we could lose market share  which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
our products are dependent on the continued success of our proprietary symbol sets 
our proprietary symbol sets are important components of both our speech generating technologies and our special education software 
using symbols rather than text makes communication more efficient and more broadly accessible to people with a wide range of cognitive abilities 
while we believe that our proprietary symbol sets include the most widely used set of graphic symbols utilized in speech generating technology and special education software  if speech language pathologists or our clients begin to prefer an alternate symbol set because  for example  they determine that an alternate symbol set is easier to learn or more efficient than our proprietary symbol sets or if a superior symbol set is developed by one of our competitors  we could lose market share in both our speech generating technologies and special education software  which could adversely affect our reputation  business  financial condition and results of operations 
we depend upon certain third party suppliers and licensing arrangements  making us vulnerable to supply problems and price fluctuations  which could harm our business 
we currently rely on third party suppliers for the components of our speech generating devices 
in some cases  there are relatively few alternate sources of supply for certain other components that are necessary for the hardware components of our speech generating devices 
our reliance on these outside suppliers also subjects us to risks that could harm our business  including we may not be able to obtain adequate supply in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms  we may have difficulty locating and qualifying alternate suppliers  our suppliers manufacture products for a range of customers  and fluctuations in demand for the products those suppliers manufacture for others may affect their ability to deliver components to us in a timely manner  our suppliers may encounter financial hardships unrelated to our demand for components  which could inhibit their ability to fulfill our orders and meet our requirements  and any interruption or delay in the supply of components or materials  or our inability to obtain components or materials from alternate sources at acceptable prices in a timely manner  could impair our ability to meet the demand of our customers and cause them to cancel orders or switch to competitive products 
some of the software and other intellectual property that is incorporated into our products is owned by third parties and licensed by us 
we may not be able to negotiate or renegotiate these licenses on commercially reasonable terms  or at all  and the third party intellectual property may not be appropriately supported or maintained by the licensors 
if we are unable to obtain the rights necessary to use or continue to use third party intellectual property in our products and services it could result in increased costs  or an inability to develop new products 

table of contents if our patents and other intellectual property rights do not adequately protect our products  we may lose market share to our competitors and be unable to operate our business profitably 
patents  trademarks  copyrights and other proprietary rights are important to our business  and our ability to compete effectively with other companies depends on the proprietary nature of our technologies 
we also rely on trade secrets  know how and continuing technological innovations to develop  maintain and strengthen our competitive position 
however  any pending patent applications may not result in issued patents  any current or future patents issued or licensed to us may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented and the rights granted thereunder may not provide a competitive advantage to us or prevent other companies from independently developing technology that is similar to ours or introducing competitive products 
in addition  our pending trademark registration applications may not be approved by the applicable governmental authorities and  even if the applications are approved  third parties may seek to oppose or otherwise challenge these registrations 
failure to obtain trademark registrations in the united states and in other countries could limit our ability to protect our trademarks and impede our marketing efforts in those jurisdictions 
although our proprietary symbol sets are protected by certain trademarks and copyrights  a third party could seek to utilize our symbol sets without our authorization 
furthermore  we may have to take legal action in the future to protect our intellectual property  or to defend ourselves against claimed infringement of the rights of others 
any legal action of that type could be costly and time consuming to us and could divert the attention of management  and such actions may not be successful 
the invalidation or circumvention of key copyrights  patents  trademarks or other proprietary rights which we own or unsuccessful outcomes in lawsuits to protect our intellectual property may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the laws of foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
if we cannot adequately protect our intellectual property rights in foreign countries  our competitors may be able to compete more directly with us  which could adversely affect our competitive position and  as a result  our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our products could infringe on the intellectual property of others  which may cause us to engage in costly litigation and could cause us to pay substantial damages and prohibit us from selling our products 
third parties may assert infringement or other intellectual property claims against us based on their intellectual property rights 
if such claims are successful  we may have to pay substantial damages for past infringement 
we might also be prohibited from selling our products or providing certain content or devices without first obtaining a license from the third party  which  if available at all  may require us to pay royalties 
moreover  we may need to redesign some of our products to avoid future infringement liability 
even if infringement claims against us are without merit  defending a lawsuit takes significant time  may be expensive and may divert management attention from other business concerns 
the market opportunities for our products and content may not be as large as we believe 
our business strategy is to grow our sales to satisfy unmet demand for our speech generating devices among non verbal individuals and for our special education authoring tools and content among special education teachers 
our expectations for future growth are dependent on our estimates of the number of people who can benefit from our speech generating technologies and special education software and the future growth in conditions that lead to speech and cognitive impairment  such as strokes and autism 
however  these market opportunities for our products may not be as large as we believe and may not develop as expected 
for example  although the sales of our speech generating devices could grow faster than we expect if our strategy to expand the scale  reach and sophistication of our direct sales infrastructure and build awareness of our products among potential end users and speech language pathologists is more effective than we have modeled  these sales could also be adversely impacted to the extent that these strategies are less effective than we expect  if the population of potential users does not develop as we anticipate or if some portion of the pool of potential end users that we seek to serve decides to use speech generation software applications on devices not specifically designed for this purpose  such as hand held tablet computers 

table of contents we may fail to successfully execute our strategy to grow our business 
we intend to pursue a number of different strategies to grow our revenue and earnings 
however  we may not be able to successfully execute these strategies 
for example  while we intend to expand and diversify our revenue streams through expanding the sales of professionally generated content for the users of our special education software platform  we have limited experience in producing and selling such content and may not be successful at doing so 
while we believe our new software platform will facilitate these sales  the market for such content may not be as large as we believe or we may be unable to produce content that successfully competes with user generated content or content produced by competitors 
we may attempt to pursue acquisitions or strategic alliances  which may be unsuccessful 
we may attempt to achieve our business objectives through acquisitions and strategic alliances 
we compete with other companies for these opportunities  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to effect acquisitions or strategic alliances on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
even if we enter into these transactions  we may experience  among other things difficulties in integrating any acquired companies and products into our existing business  inability to realize the benefits we anticipate in a timely fashion  or at all  attrition of key personnel from acquired businesses  significant costs  charges or writedowns  or unforeseen operating difficulties that require significant financial and managerial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development and expansion of our existing operations 
consummating these transactions could also result in the incurrence of additional debt and related interest expense  as well as unforeseen contingent liabilities  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may also issue additional equity in connection with these transactions which would dilute our then existing stockholders 
we are subject to a variety of risks due to our international operations that could adversely affect those operations or our profitability and operating results 
our operations in countries outside the united states  which accounted for of our net sales for the year ended july   are accompanied by certain financial and other risks 
we intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in sales outside the united states  which could expose us to greater risks associated with international sales and operations 
our profitability and international operations are  and will continue to be  subject to a number of risks and potential costs  including changes in foreign medical reimbursement programs and policies  local product preferences and product requirements  longer term receivables than are typical in the united states  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  less protection of intellectual property in some countries outside the united states  trade protection measures and import and export licensing requirements  work force instability  dependence on third party distributors  international terrorism and anti american sentiment  
table of contents political and economic instability  and the potential payment of us income taxes on certain earnings of our foreign subsidiaries upon repatriation 
our sales in international markets are also heavily dependent on public funding 
we experienced a softening of demand for our products in international markets  including canada and the united kingdom  last fiscal year that we believe was as a result of constraints in government spending 
continued or increases in constraints in public funding for our products in our key international markets could adversely affect our net sales and results of operations 
in addition  our business practices in foreign countries are subject to compliance with us law  including the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa 
we have a compliance program in place designed to reduce the likelihood of potential violations of the fcpa and other us laws 
if violations were to occur  they could subject us to fines and other penalties as well as increased compliance costs 
in addition  a significant amount of trade receivables are with national healthcare systems in many countries 
repayment is accordingly dependent to a degree upon the financial stability of the economies of those countries 
we depend on third party distributors to market and sell our products internationally in a number of markets 
our business  financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by both our distributors performance and our ability to maintain these relationships on terms that are favorable to us 
we depend  in part  on international third party distributors to sell our products in many jurisdictions outside the united states 
in the fiscal year ended july   our net sales through international third party distributors were of our total net sales 
our international distributors operate independently of us  and we have limited control over their operations  which exposes us to certain risks 
distributors may not commit the necessary resources to market and sell our products and may also market and sell competitive products 
in addition  our distributors may not comply with the laws and regulatory requirements in their local jurisdictions  which may limit their ability to market or sell our products 
if current or future distributors do not perform adequately  or if we are unable to locate competent distributors in particular countries and secure their services on favorable terms  or at all  we may be unable to increase or maintain our level of net sales in these markets or enter new markets  and we may not realize our expected international growth 
our business could be adversely affected by disruption to our suppliers operations due to the recent natural disaster in japan 
certain companies that supply us with materials and components maintain facilities in japan 
even if these suppliers facilities are not located near the epicenter of the march sendai earthquake  they may be affected by the consequences of the natural disaster that has affected japan  which have included rolling blackouts  decreased access to materials and limited ability to ship inventory 
if these conditions persist  we may experience price increases or shortages of key materials required for the assembly of our own products which could affect our ability to manufacture and ship our products 
failure to obtain regulatory approval in foreign jurisdictions could prevent us from marketing our products abroad 
we have commercial and marketing efforts in a number of international jurisdictions and may seek to market our products in new countries in the future 
outside the united states  we can generally market a product only if we receive a marketing authorization and  in some cases  pricing approval  from the appropriate regulatory authorities 
the approval procedure varies among countries 
we may not obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis  if at all 
approval by one regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries 

table of contents our business could be adversely affected by competition including potential new entrants 
although we have few competitors in our specific areas of speech generating technology and special education software  many other companies compete within the broader assistive technology market and could choose to enter the areas in which we have chosen to focus 
we also face the risk of new entrants who do not currently compete in any segment of the assistive technology market  whether through acquisition of a current competitor or a new startup from a company that engages in a complementary business to ours  such as producers of educational software or consumer electronics 
these competitors and potential competitors may have substantially greater capital resources  larger customer bases  broader product lines  larger sales forces  greater marketing and management resources  larger research and development staffs  larger facilities than ours  as well as global distribution channels that may be more effective than ours 
these competitors may develop new technologies or more effective products that would compete directly with our products 
these new technologies may make it more difficult to market our products and could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
competing with these companies will require continued investment by us in research and development  marketing  customer service and support 
even with such continued investments  we may not be able to successfully compete with new entrants in the areas in which we compete 
if we fail to comply with the us federal anti kickback statute and similar state and foreign laws  we could be subject to criminal and civil penalties and exclusion from medicare  medicaid and other governmental programs 
a provision of the us social security act  commonly referred to as the us federal anti kickback statute  prohibits the offer  payment  solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for referring  ordering  leasing  purchasing or arranging for or recommending the ordering  purchasing or leasing of items or services payable by medicare  medicaid or any other federal healthcare program 
the federal anti kickback statute is very broad in scope and many of its provisions have not been uniformly or definitively interpreted by existing case law or regulations 
in addition  most of the states in which our products are sold in the united states have adopted laws similar to the federal anti kickback statute  and some of these laws are even broader than the federal anti kickback statute in that their prohibitions are not limited to items or services paid for by a federal healthcare program but  instead  apply regardless of the source of payment 
violations of the federal anti kickback statute or such similar state laws may result in substantial civil or criminal penalties and exclusion from participation in federal or state healthcare programs 
we derive a significant portion of our net sales from international operations  and many foreign governments have equivalent statutes with similar penalties 
all of our financial relationships with healthcare providers and others who provide products or services to federal healthcare program beneficiaries are potentially governed by the federal anti kickback statute and similar state or foreign laws 
we believe our operations are in material compliance with the federal anti kickback statute and similar state or foreign laws 
however  we cannot assure you that we will not be subject to investigations or litigation alleging violations of these laws  which could be time consuming and costly to us  could divert management s attention from operating our business and could prevent healthcare providers from purchasing our products  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  if our arrangements were found to violate the federal anti kickback statute or similar state or foreign laws  it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
if we fail to comply with the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa  we could be subject to enforcement actions 
federal and state laws protect the confidentiality of certain patient health information  including patient medical records  and restrict the use and disclosure of patient health information by healthcare providers 
in particular  in april  the us department of health and human services published patient privacy rules under hipaa and  in april  published security rules for protected health information 
the hipaa privacy and security rules govern the use  disclosure and security of protected health information by covered entities  which are healthcare providers that submit electronic claims  health plans and healthcare clearinghouses 
through our sales of speech generating technologies  we are a covered entity 
we are committed to maintaining the security and privacy of patients health information and believe that we meet the expectations of the hipaa rules 
while we believe we are and will be in compliance with all hipaa standards  there is no guarantee that we will not be subject to enforcement actions  which can be costly and interrupt regular operations of our business 
governmental compliance is critical to the operation of our business 
as legislators and regulatory bodies increase scrutiny of our industry  there may be adverse statements or charges against us by regulators or elected officials 
regardless of the factual basis  such allegations can result in investigation by regulators  legislators  and law enforcement officials  or in lawsuits 
responding to such allegations can be costly and time consuming 
adverse publicity can have a negative impact on our reputation  which could adversely affect our business and the results of operations 

table of contents risks related to our organizational structure dynavox inc s only material asset is its interest in dynavox systems holdings llc  and it is accordingly dependent upon distributions from dynavox systems holdings llc to pay taxes  make payments under the tax receivable agreement or pay dividends 
dynavox inc is a holding company and has no material assets other than its ownership of partnership units of dynavox systems holdings llc  or holdings units 
dynavox inc has no independent means of generating revenue 
dynavox inc intends to cause dynavox systems holdings llc to make distributions to its unitholders in an amount sufficient to cover all applicable taxes at assumed tax rates  payments under the tax receivable agreement and dividends  if any  declared by it 
to the extent that dynavox inc needs funds  and dynavox systems holdings llc is restricted from making such distributions under applicable law or regulation or under the terms of our financing arrangements  or is otherwise unable to provide such funds  it could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition 
dynavox systems llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of dynavox systems holdings llc  has entered into a senior secured credit facility 
this agreement includes a restricted payment covenant  which restricts the ability of dynavox systems llc to make distributions to its parent  dynavox systems holdings llc  which  in turn  limits the ability of dynavox systems holdings llc to make distributions to dynavox inc in addition  each of dynavox systems llc and dynavox systems holdings llc are generally prohibited under delaware law from making a distribution to a member to the extent that  at the time of the distribution  after giving effect to the distribution  liabilities of the limited liability company with certain exceptions exceed the fair value of its assets 
dynavox inc is controlled by the limited partners of dynavox systems holdings llc  whose interests may differ from those of our public shareholders 
as of july   the limited partners of dynavox systems holdings llc controlled approximately of the combined voting power of our class a and class b common stock 
accordingly  the limited partners of dynavox systems holdings llc have the ability to elect all of the members of our board of directors  and thereby to control our management and affairs 
in addition  they are able to determine the outcome of all matters requiring shareholder approval  including mergers and other material transactions  and are able to cause or prevent a change in the composition of our board of directors or a change in control of our company that could deprive our shareholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their class a common stock as part of a sale of our company and might ultimately affect the market price of our class a common stock 
in addition  as of july   the limited partners of dynavox systems holdings llc owned of the holdings units 
because they hold their ownership interest in our business through dynavox systems holdings llc  rather than through the public company  these owners may have conflicting interests with holders of shares of our class a common stock 
for example  these owners may have different tax positions from us which could influence their decisions regarding whether and when to dispose of assets  whether and when to incur new or refinance existing indebtedness  especially in light of the existence of the tax receivable agreement that we entered in connection with our ipo  and whether and when dynavox inc should terminate the tax receivable agreement and accelerate its obligations thereunder 
in addition  the structuring of future transactions may take into consideration these owners tax or other considerations even where no similar benefit would accrue to us 
see item certain relationships and related transactions  and director independence 
prior to our ipo  dynavox inc and dynavox systems holdings llc entered into an amended and restated securityholders agreement with funds affiliated with vestar capital partners or  together with its affiliates  vestar  park avenue equity partners lp or  together with its affiliates  park avenue and certain specified other holders of holdings units from time to time  including our executive officers 
the amended and restated securityholders agreement includes  until such time as the securityholders cease to own at least of the total voting power of dynavox inc  a voting agreement pursuant to which the securityholders have agreed to vote their shares and to take any other action necessary to elect the following directors of dynavox inc one director who shall be the chief executive officer and for so long as vestar holds of the total voting power of dynavox inc  all of the remaining directors shall be designated by vestar 
in addition  the amended and restated securityholders agreement provides vestar with certain take along rights  requiring the other investors party to that agreement to consent to a proposed sale of dynavox systems holdings llc 
these provisions give vestar substantial control over the company  and vestar s interests may differ with your interests as a holder of the class a common stock 
see item certain relationships and related transactions  and director independence 
as of july   parties to the amended and restated security holders agreement controlled approximately of the combined voting power of our class a and class b common stock and held of the holdings units 

table of contents our certificate of incorporation contains a provision renouncing our interest and expectancy in certain corporate opportunities identified by vestar 
vestar and its affiliates are in the business of providing buyout capital and growth capital to developing companies  and may acquire interests in businesses that directly or indirectly compete with certain portions of our business 
our certificate of incorporation provides for the allocation of certain corporate opportunities between us  on the one hand  and vestar  on the other hand 
as set forth in our certificate of incorporation  neither vestar  nor any director  officer  stockholder  member  manager or employee of vestar has any duty to refrain from engaging  directly or indirectly  in the same business activities or similar business activities or lines of business in which we operate 
therefore  a director or officer of our company who also serves as a director  officer  member  manager or employee of vestar may pursue certain acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and  as a result  such acquisition opportunities may not be available to us 
these potential conflicts of interest could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or prospects if attractive corporate opportunities are allocated by vestar to themselves or their other affiliates instead of to us 
we are a controlled company within the meaning of the nasdaq global select market rules 
as a result  we qualify for  and rely on  exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements 
the parties to our amended and restated securityholders agreement continue to control a majority of the combined voting power of all classes of our voting stock 
as a result  we are a controlled company within the meaning of the nasdaq global select market corporate governance standards 
under these rules  a company of which more than of the voting power is held by an individual  a group or another company is a controlled company and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements of the nasdaq global select market  including a majority independent board of directors and independent director oversight of executive officer compensation and director nominations 
we rely on these exemptions and  as a result  we do not have a majority of independent directors and our compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees do not consist entirely of independent directors 
accordingly  our stockholders do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the nasdaq global select market 
we will be required to pay the counterparties to the tax receivable agreement for certain tax benefits we may claim arising in connection with our ipo  future purchases or exchanges of holdings units and related transactions  and the amounts we may pay could be significant 
in connection with our ipo  we purchased holdings units from our pre ipo owners  including members of our senior management 
we also entered into a tax receivable agreement with our pre ipo owners that provides for the payment by dynavox inc to these parties of of the benefits  if any  that dynavox inc is deemed to realize as a result of i the existing tax basis in the intangible assets of dynavox systems holdings llc on the date of our ipo  ii the increases in tax basis resulting from our purchases or exchanges of holdings units and iii certain other tax benefits related to our entering into the tax receivable agreement  including tax benefits attributable to payments under the tax receivable agreement 
see item certain relationships and related transactions  and director independence 
we expect that the payments that we may make under the tax receivable agreement will be substantial 
there may be a material negative effect on our liquidity if  as a result of timing discrepancies or otherwise  the payments under the tax receivable agreement exceed the actual benefits we realize in respect of the tax attributes subject to the tax receivable agreement and or distributions to dynavox inc by dynavox systems holdings llc are not sufficient to permit dynavox inc to make payments under the tax receivable agreement after it has paid taxes 
the payments under the tax receivable agreement are not conditioned upon the continued ownership of us by the counterparties to the tax receivable agreement 
in certain cases  payments under the tax receivable agreement may be accelerated and or significantly exceed the actual benefits we realize in respect of the tax attributes subject to the tax receivable agreement 
the tax receivable agreement provides that upon certain mergers  asset sales  other forms of business combinations or other changes of control  the corporate taxpayer s or its successor s obligations with respect to exchanged or acquired holdings units whether exchanged or acquired before or after such transaction would be based on certain assumptions  including that the corporate taxpayer would have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize the deductions arising from the increased tax deductions and tax basis and other benefits related to entering into the tax receivable agreement 
upon a subsequent actual exchange  any additional increase in tax deductions  tax basis and other benefits in excess of the amounts assumed at the change in control will also result in payments under the tax receivable agreement 
as a result  we could be required to make payments under the tax receivable agreement that are greater than the specified percentage of the actual benefits we realize 
moreover  if we elect to terminate the tax receivable agreement early including in connection with or following a change of control  we would be required to make an immediate payment equal to the present value calculated utilizing a discount rate equal to libor plus basis points of the anticipated future tax benefits 
in 
table of contents addition to the assumption that the corporate taxpayer would have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize the deductions arising from the increased tax deductions and tax basis and other benefits  this upfront payment would be calculated based upon additional assumptions  including that any holdings units that had not then been exchanged would be deemed to be exchanged for the market value of the class a common stock at the time of the termination and that the tax rates for future years would be those specified in the law as in effect at the time of termination 
in any of these situations  our obligations under the tax receivable agreement could be significant and significantly in excess of any tax benefits that we realize 
payments under the tax receivable agreement will be based on the tax reporting positions that we determine 
although we are not aware of any issue that would cause the irs to challenge a tax basis increase  the corporate taxpayer will not be reimbursed for any payments previously made under the tax receivable agreement 
as a result  in certain circumstances  payments could be made under the tax receivable agreement in excess of the benefits that the corporate taxpayer actually realizes in respect of i the existing tax basis in the intangible assets of dynavox systems holdings llc on the date of our ipo  ii the increases in tax basis resulting from our purchases or exchanges of holdings units and iii certain other tax benefits related to our entering into the tax receivable agreement  including tax benefits attributable to payments under the tax receivable agreement 
our use of leverage may expose us to substantial risks 
as of july   we had an aggregate of million of long term debt outstanding including current installments  which consisted entirely of borrowings under our million term loan 
as of july   we had no borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
in addition  we may incur additional indebtedness in the future 
accordingly  we are exposed to the typical risks associated with the use of leverage 
increased leverage makes it more difficult for us to withstand adverse economic conditions or business plan variances  to take advantage of new business opportunities  or to make necessary capital expenditures 
the existing senior secured credit agreement contains covenant restrictions that limit our ability to conduct our business  including restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness 
our ability to maintain our compliance with these covenants is dependent upon our financial performance  which is influenced by a number of factors  including the levels of government funding in the us and key international markets 
violation of any of these covenants would result in an event of default under the credit facility 
upon the occurrence of an event of default  including in the event of non compliance with the financial ratios required under the existing senior credit agreement  the lenders would have the ability to accelerate all amounts then outstanding under the credit facility  except that  upon bankruptcy and insolvency events of default  such acceleration is automatic 
upon the occurrence  and during the continuance  of an event of default under the credit facility  we would no longer have access to our revolving credit facility and we would have to reclassify on our balance sheet amounts currently shown as long term debt under the credit facility to short term debt 
under these circumstances  we may not be able to pay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it on terms that are acceptable to us or at all 
a substantial portion of our cash flow could be required for debt service and  as a result  might not be available for our operations or other purpose 
any substantial decrease in cash flows or any substantial increase in expenses could make it difficult for us to meet our debt service requirements or force us to modify our operations 
our level of indebtedness may make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business  regulatory and economic conditions 
for a more detailed discussion of our senior secured credit facility  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources financing agreements 

table of contents this annual report on form k does not include an independent registered public accounting firm s audit of our internal control over financial reporting 
under rules established under the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of  specifically subsection c exemption for smaller issuers  under section g exemption for non accelerated filers  the company is not required to obtain  and therefore did not obtain  an opinion on our internal control over financial reporting from our independent registered public accounting firm 
because we have not yet engaged an independent registered public accounting firm to conduct an audit of our internal control over financial reporting  we cannot conclude that such an audit would not uncover a material weakness in our internal controls or a combination of significant deficiencies that could result in the conclusion that we have a material weakness in our internal controls 
if in the future we are required to conduct an independent public accounting firm audit of our internal control over financial reporting and such audit findings conclude that we have a material weakness in our internal controls or a combination of significant deficiencies that could result in the conclusion that we have a material weakness in our internal controls  our management may not be able to certify as to the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting 
matters impacting our internal controls may cause us to be unable to report our financial information on a timely basis and thereby subject us to adverse regulatory consequences  including sanctions by the sec or violations of applicable stock exchange listing rules  and result in a breach of the covenants under our debt agreements 
there also could be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of investor confidence in us and the reliability of our financial statements 
confidence in the reliability of our financial statements also could suffer if we or our independent registered public accounting firm were to report a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting 
this could materially adversely affect us and lead to a decline in the price of our class a common stock 
anti takeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law might discourage or delay acquisition attempts for us that you might consider favorable 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors 
among other things  these provisions authorize the issuance of undesignated preferred stock  the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval  and which may include super voting  special approval  dividend  or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of the holders of class a common stock  prohibit stockholder action by written consent  which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders  provide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make  alter  or repeal our bylaws and that our stockholders may only amend our bylaws with the approval of or more of all of the outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote  and establish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings 
these anti takeover provisions and other provisions under delaware law could discourage  delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company  including actions that our stockholders may deem advantageous  or negatively affect the trading price of our class a common stock 
these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions you desire 
risks related to our class a common stock shares of our class a common stock price may decline due to the large number of shares of class a common stock eligible for future sale and for exchange 
the market price of shares of our class a common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of class a common stock in the market or the perception that such sales could occur 
these sales  or the possibility that these sales may occur  also might make it more difficult for us to sell shares of class a common stock in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate 

table of contents we do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
we do not expect to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future 
payments of future dividends  if any  will be at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors  including our business  operating results and financial condition  current and anticipated cash needs  plans for expansion and any legal or contractual limitations on our ability to pay dividends 
as a result  capital appreciation in the price of our class a common stock  if any  may be your only source of gain on an investment in our class a common stock 
even if we decide in the future to pay any dividends  dynavox inc is a holding company with no independent operations of its own 
as a result  dynavox inc depends on dynavox systems holdings llc and its subsidiaries and affiliates for cash to pay its obligations and make dividend payments 
deterioration in the financial conditions  earnings or cash flow of dynavox systems holdings llc and its subsidiaries for any reason could limit or impair their ability to pay cash distributions or other distributions to us 
in addition  our ability to pay dividends in the future is dependent upon our receipt of cash from dynavox systems holdings llc and its subsidiaries 
dynavox systems holdings llc and its subsidiaries may be restricted from sending cash to us by  among other things  law or provisions of the documents governing our existing or future indebtedness 
if securities or industry analysts stop publishing research or reports about our business  or if they downgrade their recommendations regarding our class a common stock  our stock price and trading volume could decline 
the trading market for our class a common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business 
if any of the analysts who covers us downgrades our class a common stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business  our class a common stock price may decline 
if analysts cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us  we could lose visibility in the financial markets  which in turn could cause our class a common stock price or trading volume to decline and our class a common stock to be less liquid 
the market price of shares of our class a common stock may be volatile  which could cause the value of your investment to decline 
the market price of our class a common stock may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations 
securities markets worldwide experience significant price and volume fluctuations 
this market volatility  as well as general economic  market or political conditions  could reduce the market price of shares of our class a common stock in spite of our operating performance 
in addition  our operating results could be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors due to a number of potential factors  including variations in our quarterly operating results or dividends  if any  to stockholders  additions or departures of key management personnel  failure to meet analysts earnings estimates  publication of research reports about our industry  litigation and government investigations  changes or proposed changes in laws or regulations or differing interpretations or enforcement thereof affecting our business  adverse market reaction to any indebtedness we may incur or securities we may issue in the future  changes in market valuations of similar companies or speculation in the press or investment community  announcements by our competitors of significant contracts  acquisitions  dispositions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  adverse publicity about the industries we participate in or individual scandals  and in response the market price of shares of our class a common stock could decrease significantly 
you may be unable to resell your shares of class a common stock at or above the price you originally paid 
in the past years  stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies 
this litigation  if instituted against us  could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management s attention and resources 
you may be diluted by the future issuance of additional class a common stock in connection with our incentive plans  acquisitions or otherwise 
as of july   we have an aggregate of more than million shares of class a common stock authorized but unissued  including approximately million shares of class a common stock issuable upon exchange of outstanding holdings units 
our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue these shares of class a common stock and options  rights  warrants and appreciation rights relating to class a common stock for the consideration and on the terms and conditions established by our board of directors in its sole discretion  whether in connection with acquisitions or otherwise 

table of contents we have reserved  shares for issuance under our long term incentive plan  including  shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options that we have granted to our officers and employees 
see item executive compensation 
any class a common stock that we issue  including under our long term incentive plan or other equity incentive plans that we may adopt in the future  would dilute the percentage ownership held by the then existing holders of our class a common stock
