item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our business redwood trust  inc  together with its subsidiaries redwood  we  or us  invests in  finances  and manages real estate assets 
we invest in residential and commercial real estate loans and in asset backed securities backed by real estate loans 
we seek to invest in assets that have the potential to generate sufficient long term cash flow returns to support our goal of distributing an attractive level of dividends per share to shareholders over time 
our primary source of income is typically net interest income  which consists of the interest income we earn from our investments less the interest expenses we incur on borrowed funds and other liabilities 
we assume a range of risks in our investments and the level of risk is influenced by the manner in which we finance our purchases of  and derive income from  our investments 
our investments include residential and commercial real estate loans and securities backed by residential and commercial loans 
the securities include both senior securities and subordinate securities 
senior securities often investment grade are those interests in a securitization that have the first right to cash flows and are last to absorb losses 
subordinate securities often below investment grade are those interests in a securitization that have the last right to cash flows and are first in line to absorb losses 
we may also invest in re remic securities  or securities that were created through the resecuritization of certain senior interests in residential mortgage securitizations to provide additional credit support to those interests 
residential securities we invest in are generally acquired by us from third parties or by retaining mortgage backed securities issued by sequoia securitization trusts  which are securitization entities we sponsor 
the process of sponsoring a sequoia securitization includes the acquisition of residential loans  which we generally fund with equity and short term debt during the accumulation period  the transfer of a pool of those loans to a sequoia securitization entity  and the structuring and issuance by the sequoia securitization entity of mortgage backed securities collateralized by that pool of loans 
senior securities issued by sequoia securitization entities are generally issued to third parties  while the subordinate securities issued by these entities are generally retained by us 
historically  we have also sponsored other entities a private limited partnership fund that we manage  the redwood opportunity fund  lp the fund  and acacia securitization entities that we also manage 
the fund and the acacia securitization entities generally invested in a variety of real estate related assets 
our investments in these entities are currently financed with equity and long term debt 
we are not currently seeking to sponsor other entities like the fund and the acacia securitization entities 
each securitization entity is independent of redwood and of each other and the assets and liabilities are not owned by and are not obligations of redwood  although we are exposed to certain financial risks associated with our role as the sponsor or manager of these entities 
for financial reporting purposes  we are required to consolidate the assets and liabilities of the fund and the assets and liabilities of many of the sequoia and acacia securitization entities we have sponsored 
the commercial real estate loans we invest in are primarily originated by us and any commercial mortgage backed securities we invest in are acquired from third parties 
our commercial investments are currently financed with equity and long term debt 
for tax purposes  we are structured as a real estate investment trust reit 
as a reit  we are able to pass through substantially all of our earnings to our stockholders without paying income tax at the corporate level 
we pay income tax on the reit taxable income we retain and on the income we earn at our taxable subsidiaries 
business update fourth quarter a year ago  we observed that new private securitization was within sight but hurdles remained  commercial investment opportunities were near  and we liked our competitive position 
at the time  we had not completed a residential mortgage backed securitization since august in the wake of the financial crisis 
our commercial team was in a formative stage and we had just recently hired the head of that team 

table of contents residential mortgage loan business in april  we completed the first non agency residential mortgage backed securitization backed by newly originated loans since mid going into  we had plans to complete additional mortgage securitizations  but we had no assurances that we could do so 
in fact  investors in residential mortgage backed securities rmbs were still aggressively buying seasoned senior rmbs at yields well above jumbo mortgage rates  making the securitization economics unattractive at that time 
we accomplished most of our residential business plans in after completing the securitization in april  we launched our residential mortgage conduit program for acquiring loans from originators 
by the end of  we had acquired million of residential loans and had a pipeline of million of additional loans from conduit program originators identified for subsequent acquisition 
we submitted our government sponsored enterprises gse reform plan to regulators in july and published the redwood guide to restoring private sector residential mortgage securitization in november 
we had several opportunities to discuss both of these documents with federal regulators and policy makers 
in late  we started rebuilding our sequoia securitization platform 
we did so based on our beliefs that the government s role in backing roughly of annual mortgage originations was unsustainable  private securitization would return  we had several competitive advantages in private securitization  building a better jumbo mortgage conduit would likely and ultimately benefit our shareholders  and redwood should take a leading role in restarting private securitization 
taking a longer view  we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities we expect to result from a meaningful reduction in the federal government s role in supporting mortgage finance 
this will take time and may not begin to significantly affect our results until we would  of course  prefer more immediate loan volume for our residential mortgage conduit to make the activity more efficient  profitable  and beneficial for shareholders 
residential portfolio business while the year treasury yield increased in the fourth quarter by basis points  the overall decline for of basis points to a level kept investors searching for yield in the secondary market for seasoned private label rmbs 
against this backdrop  our investment activity in rmbs remained subdued in the fourth quarter as credit spreads continued to grind tighter 
the following chart shows market prices for senior rmbs securities since october senior rmbs prices

source jpmorgan chase 
table of contents during the fourth quarter  our investment portfolio increased by million to million at december  the increase was driven by million in acquisitions and million in price appreciation  offset by million in pay downs 
we had no sales in the fourth quarter 
we will continue to manage our mortgage securities with an eye to protect credit and enhance returns  as possible 
while we do not anticipate significant further price appreciation  we will stay vigilant for opportunities that result from uncertainty and changes in perceptions in the market 
for example  negative headlines on housing could help create investment opportunities in select rmbs 
we view volatility that often comes with uncertainty as potentially a good source of opportunities 
on the margin  we expect to continue to manage the risk reward of our portfolio 
commercial loan business the progress and results for our commercial loan business have been promising 
our commercial business is actively engaged as an originator and underwriter of commercial mezzanine loans on high quality  stabilized assets 
we invested million in the fourth quarter through our funding of three new mezzanine loans 
in february  we originated another million mezzanine loan 
our team is in place  we have built processes and strengthened relationships  and our lending opportunities are expanding 
we currently expect a significant portion of the capital we invest in to go into commercial assets  and our commercial investments could rise to become of our invested capital over the next year or two 
the commercial real estate market is experiencing a significant increase in the volume of financing transactions as liquidity has increasingly returned in earnest for stabilized commercial assets 
fundamentals appear to have at least stabilized in select metropolitan markets  especially for multifamily properties  strong anchored retail space  and class a office space in central business districts 
the increased capital flows to commercial real estate can be seen in the recent resurgence in the commercial mortgage backed securities cmbs market 
issuance velocity for cmbs backed by high quality commercial loans is increasing 
investor demand is strong  triple a credit spreads to treasury yields continue to tighten  and borrowers are able to refinance at attractive rates and on easing credit terms 
furthermore  many banks and wall street firms are building cmbs platforms that will likely increase future originations 
last year  cmbs issuance totaled roughly billion excluding agency originations 
some market observers expect cmbs issuance of approximately to billion for the environment for building our commercial business and making investments is favorable  particularly since we expect an increase in the flow of the types of lending opportunities we want for our business 
at this point  there are no meaningful regulatory challenges to commercial real estate finance 
as is the case with all of our investment activities  we are focused on getting credit right 
we believe we have built the in house expertise  platform  market recognition  and relationships to allow us to prosper over time 
it is our objective to be well positioned to originate attractive risk adjusted commercial investments on a sustainable basis  as market conditions ebb and flow 
currently  we are focused on providing long term solutions to meet the challenge of financing the gap between the amount of equity a borrower will invest into a property and the amount of financing available from the senior lender 
our balance sheet is well suited for retaining this type of long term credit risk 
our capital and origination process provide reliability  flexibility  and advantages to borrowers  including the advantage of permanent funding of longer term assets 
housing finance reform over the past year  participants in the origination and securitization process have seen numerous regulatory proposals and  of course  the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank put forth various ideas and frameworks for reforming the regulatory regime that governs residential mortgage securitization 
uncertainty about where all of these proposals will settle has been a clear headwind for private mortgage securitization participants 
we expect greater certainty as crucial implementation details for dodd frank and related regulations emerge  particularly as they relate to how qualified residential mortgages will be defined and what risk retention will look like 
once the rules of the road are known  market participants throughout the mortgage chain can begin to adjust their policies  
table of contents practices  and operations 
in reality  it will only be after participants in this market begin to function under new rules that we will have the best empirical evidence of whether the regulatory framework needs further reform in one direction or another 
as a significant step in this process  in february  the obama administration made recommendations to congress pertaining to the mortgage industry through a department of treasury white paper titled  reforming america s housing finance market 
as specifically cited in treasury s paper  the reform plan is designed to pave the way for a robust private mortgage market by reducing government support for housing and winding down fannie mae and freddie mac on a responsible timeline 
although implementation of reforms will take time  if reform is implemented as set forth in the plan  it will be a positive long term development for private residential mortgage investors such as us 
during the financial crisis that began in  government intervention into the mortgage market through fannie mae and freddie mac  as well as through the federal housing administration fha  was essential to maintaining the flow of mortgage liquidity to support housing 
private mortgage financing through securitization had ceased and banks were unable to fill the void as their balance sheets were generally under pressure 
more recently  we have observed the resurgence of other private asset backed securities abs markets eg  credit cards  auto loans  and now cmbs which are now up and functioning while rmbs issuance has barely budged 
many have asked  why to us  there are several contributing factors  but none more relevant than the historically high level of attractive government financing that is currently crowding out traditional private market participants 
major banks are benefiting from government involvement by selling about of their mortgage originations to gses such as fannie mae and freddie mac 
further  banks currently have low funding costs and ample balance sheet capacity to retain the remaining jumbo mortgage loans that do not conform to government loan limits or product standards 
as a result  there is little financial motivation for banks to securitize loans or sell loans to third parties such as redwood for private securitization 
however  we believe that the obama administration s recommendations  if enacted  would significantly change this market dynamic 
we acknowledge concerns expressed by some market participants that any reduction to the current level of government support for housing at a time when the private markets are not fully functioning could cause credit to become scarcer and mortgage rates to increase 
on the other hand  many believe that the excessive government support is the biggest reason for the dearth of private securitizations 
to strike the right balance  we believe the status quo is an unsustainable burden on taxpayers and needs to be tested through a gradual  well planned process that has safeguards at each incremental phase to ensure that the private sector is ready to step up and offer attractive mortgage financing as the government steps back 
regardless of where housing finance reform takes us  we are encouraged to see dialogue and debate of the issues rather than just postponing discussion of reform to the future 
meanwhile  we believe temporary loan limits for high cost areas will likely be allowed to expire on september  lowering loan limits which help determine how big a role the gses play in housing finance is an easy way to effectively make a first step in gse reform 
lowering loan limits makes sense in the context of home price declines  it limits the additional burden to the taxpayer  and it opens a door for the private sector to return to financing mortgages in a more significant way 
outlook we are building for the future  which requires patience by management and especially by shareholders 
we continue to expect our residential portfolio business to generate the majority of our interest income in  and we expect yields on these securities to remain relatively stable over time 
however  we have laid a strong foundation for our commercial and residential loan businesses and expect an increasing amount of our earnings to come from these businesses over time

net interest income after provision and mva was million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
these results reflect a decline in net interest income due to lower principal balances on securities and loans at consolidating entities 
the decline was more than offset by a significantly reduced provision for loan losses for the sequoia entities due to a deceleration in borrower defaults  as well as a significant reduction in negative market valuation adjustments

the results of operations and financial condition section of this management s discussion and analysis contains a detailed analysis of the components of net income 
income loss for federal tax purposes our estimated total taxable loss was million per share for the fourth quarter of  as compared to a taxable loss of million per share for the fourth quarter of our estimated reit taxable income was less than million per share for the fourth quarter of  as compared to a reit taxable loss of million per share for the fourth quarter of the increase in estimated taxable income was primarily due to a decrease in realized credit losses on subordinate securities 
total realized credit losses for the fourth quarters of and were million per share and million per share  respectively 
our reit taxable income is that portion of our total taxable income that we earn at redwood and its qualifying reit subsidiaries and determines the minimum amount of dividends we must distribute to shareholders in order to maintain our tax status as a reit 

table of contents summary of financial condition  capital resources  and liquidity at december   our total capital was billion  including billion in stockholders equity and million of long term debt 
we use our capital to invest in earning assets  meet lender capital requirements  and fund our operations and working capital needs 
in recent years  our cash balances were a relatively good proxy for the amount of excess capital we had available to invest since we were directly funding our long term investments with cash 
more recently  we have been using cash  along with short term borrowings  to fund the accumulation of residential loans prior to securitization 
as a result  our cash balance now and going forward will reveal little about the capital we have available for long term investments 
we therefore do not believe that the drop in our cash balances from million at september  to million at december   is a meaningful indicator of our investment capacity 
to gauge the amount of capital readily available for long term investment  we look at the amount of the cash we estimate we could raise by financing all our residential loans with short term borrowings less the amount of cash we estimate we would need over the short term for operations  working capital  and liquidity needs 
on this basis  our investment capacity has increased slightly from million at september   to million at december  through february   our investment capacity has not changed significantly 
we intend to more fully employ our capital in  which will involve additional increases in borrowing activity 
our estimates of investment capacity presume that we are able to borrow on a secured basis 
we continue to closely monitor our liquidity risk and manage our capital through our risk adjusted capital policy that has served us well since the company was founded 
in the near term  we do not anticipate a need to issue additional equity 
although we plan to invest much of our excess capital in  we are more likely to look to our residential securities portfolio as a source of liquidity for additional investment capacity 
we also believe we could raise additional investment capital by permanently financing a portion of our securities portfolio either through a resecuritization or by other means 
we always retain the flexibility to raise equity capital in the future  but we seek to ask shareholders for new capital only when we believe we have accretive investment opportunities that exceed our investment capacity

we show our investments in the fund and the sequoia and acacia entities as separate line items to highlight our specific ownership interests  as the underlying assets and liabilities of these entities are legally not ours even though we are required to consolidate them for financial reporting purposes 
accordingly  we determine the estimated economic value of these investments directly as opposed to deriving their reported gaap values by netting their consolidated assets and liabilities

cash flow from securities and investments can be volatile from quarter to quarter depending on the level of invested capital  the timing of credit losses  acquisitions  sales  and changes in prepayments and interest rates 
therefore  i cash flow generated by these investments is not necessarily reflective of the long term economic yield we will earn on the investments in a given period  and  ii it is difficult to determine what portion of the cash received from an investment is a return of principal and what portion is a return on principal in a given period

investments in the fund and securitization entities the gaap reported value of our investments in the fund  sequoia entities  and acacia entities totaled million  or of our equity at december  the fair value which equals gaap carrying value of our investment in the fund was million 
the fund is primarily invested in non prime residential securities and is managed by a subsidiary of redwood 
our investment represents a interest in the fund 
the gaap carrying value of our investments in sequoia entities was million and the fair value was million 
the million of fair value consists of million of interest only securities ios and million of senior and subordinate securities and is calculated using the same valuation process that we follow to fair value our other real estate securities 
for gaap  we account for the assets and liabilities at historical cost and the net million carrying value represents the difference between the carrying costs of the assets billion at december  and liabilities billion at december  owned by the sequoia entities 
the gaap carrying value and fair value of our investments in acacia entities was million and million  respectively  at december  the fair value primarily reflects the value of future management fees we expect to receive from acacia entities 
the equity interests and securities we own in the acacia entities have minimal value 

table of contents factors affecting management s estimate of economic book value in reviewing our non gaap estimate of economic value  there are a number of important factors and limitations to consider 
the estimated economic value of our stockholders equity is calculated as of a particular point in time based on our existing assets and liabilities or  in certain cases  our estimate of economic value of our existing assets and liabilities  and does not incorporate other factors that may have a significant impact on that value  most notably the impact of future business activities and cash flows 
as a result  the estimated economic value of our stockholders equity does not necessarily represent an estimate of our net realizable value  liquidation value  or our market value as a whole 
amounts we ultimately realize from the disposition of assets or settlement of liabilities may vary significantly from the estimated economic values of those assets and liabilities 
because temporary changes in market conditions can substantially affect our estimate of the economic value of our stockholders equity  we do not believe that short term fluctuations in the economic value of our assets and liabilities are necessarily representative of the effectiveness of our investment strategy or the long term underlying value of our business 
our non gaap estimated economic value is calculated using bid side asset marks or estimated bid side values and offer side marks for our financial liabilities or estimated offered side values  as required to determine fair value under gaap 
when quoted market prices or observable market data are not available to estimate fair value  we rely on level inputs 
because assets and liabilities classified as level are generally based on unobservable inputs  the process of calculating economic value is generally subjective and involves a high degree of management judgment and assumptions 
these assumptions may have a significant effect on our estimates of economic value  and the use of different assumptions as well as changes in market conditions could have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
results of operations and financial condition the tables below present the results of redwood parent  new sequoia sequoia securitization entities created in and subsequent periods  and other consolidated entities and supplement our consolidated gaap results for the years ended december    and the consolidating balance sheet presents the new sequoia securitization entity separately from all other consolidated entities to highlight our renewed focus on growing our core business of creating residential credit investments

cash flow from many of our subordinate securities can be volatile and in certain cases eg  when the fair values of certain securities are close to zero any interest income earned can result in unusually high reported yields that are not sustainable and not necessarily meaningful 
interest income from trading securities at redwood was million in  as compared to million in and million in the million increase from to was primarily the result of million of acquisitions  which increased the average balances of our trading securities 
during  we generated million of interest income from trading securities with a very low aggregate market value  resulting in a high yield relative to our total cost basis 
the majority of the trading securities at redwood are inverse interest only certificates 
these securities have yields that are inversely related to changes in interest rates 
with short term rates declining in  these investments benefitted from significant cash flows 
however  as interest rates increase  yields and cash received on these investments may decline 
changes in fair value of these securities are recorded in the market valuation adjustment line item on our consolidated statements of income loss

we recognized positive market valuation adjustments on all trading securities of million in  primarily as a result of low short term interest rates and slow prepayments 

table of contents mva impairment on afs securities at redwood  we classify most securities as afs and report any unrealized gains and losses  as well as any otti not related to credit factors  as components of stockholders equity in our consolidated balance sheet 
any otti on afs securities that is related to adverse credit factors is recorded through our consolidated statement of income loss 
similarly  any unrealized losses on afs securities that we no longer intend to hold as of the date of the financial statements is recorded as otti through our consolidated statements of income loss 
in  we recognized an aggregate million of otti on afs securities at redwood 
of this amount  million was related to credit factors and recognized in our consolidated statement of income loss  and the remaining million was recognized as a reduction in stockholders equity 
in  we recognized an aggregate million of otti on afs securities at redwood 
of this amount  million was related to credit factors and recognized in our consolidated statement of income  and the remaining million was recognized as a reduction in stockholders equity 
in the second quarter of  we adopted new accounting guidance for otti 
as part of this adoption  we were required to evaluate million of otti on our afs securities that was previously expensed through our consolidated statements of income loss 
after evaluating this otti  we determined that million  net of tax  was related to non credit factors and million was related to credit factors 
the million was reclassified to accumulated other comprehensive income loss  effectively increasing retained earnings and decreasing accumulated comprehensive income loss to result in zero net impact to our reported stockholders equity and noncontrolling interest 
in  we recognized an aggregate million of otti on afs securities at redwood 
this amount was determined under previous gaap guidance  which did not distinguish between credit and non credit related factors 
as a result  all otti in was recognized in our consolidated statement of income loss

table of contents derivative financial instruments at redwood parent in order to manage risks associated with residential loans we own or plan to acquire in order to securitize  at december   redwood was party to interest rate agreements with an aggregate notional amount of million  to be announced contracts sold with a notional amount of million  treasury futures contracts sold with a notional amount of million  and eurodollar futures contracts sold with a notional amount of million 
these eurodollar futures contracts  unlike our other derivatives  have maturities of only three months 
therefore  in order to achieve the desired interest rate offset for risk management  consecutively maturing contracts are required  resulting in a stated notional amount that can be significantly greater than the corresponding amount of loans for which interest rate risk is being managed 
to hedge the variability in interest expense related to our long term debt we entered into interest rate swaps during with an aggregate notional balance of million at december  we designated these derivatives as cash flow hedges 
for the year ended december   these hedges decreased in value by million  of which million was recorded as a component of interest expense and the remaining million was recorded as a reduction to accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a component of stockholders equity 
securities at redwood parent we classify most senior  re remic  and subordinate securities as available for sale afs securities under gaap 
senior securities are those interests in a securitization that have the first right to cash flows and are last in line to absorb losses 
re remic securities  as presented herein  were created through the resecuritization of certain senior interests to provide additional credit support to those interests 
these re remic securities are therefore subordinate to the remaining senior interest  but senior to any subordinate tranches of the securitization from which they were created 
subordinate securities are all interests below senior and re remic interests 
the commercial and cdo securities that we own are subordinate securities

table of contents allowance for loan losses at sequoia entities each quarter we perform a process in accordance with gaap to provide management with a reasonable and adequate estimate of loan loss reserving needs 
this methodology is disclosed in note to the financial statements included in part iv of this annual report on form k 
our analysis is also discussed in note to the financial statements 
the allowance for loan losses was million at december   as compared to million at december  credit deterioration in the loan portfolio has been most notable in certain states and loan vintages from to loans originated in california  florida  and georgia  accounted for a disproportionately large share of seriously delinquent loans held by consolidated sequoia entities at december  loan repurchase risk prior to  subsidiaries of redwood purchased and deposited residential mortgage loans into sequoia securitization trusts sponsored by rwt holdings  inc and subsequently issued residential mortgage backed securities  some of which are not currently consolidated on our balance sheet for financial reporting purposes 
in connection with these securitizations  these subsidiaries of redwood made certain representations and warranties related to these loans which could result in an obligation to repurchase these loans to the extent a violation of these representations and warranties occurred 
we do not originate residential loans and believe that risk of loss due to loan repurchases ie  due to breach of representations and warranties would generally be a contingency to the third party entity from whom we acquired the loans 
however  in some cases  where loans were acquired from entities that have since become insolvent  repurchase claims would not be a contingency to a third party and may result in repurchase claims made against us 
as of december   there have been no loan level repurchase claims made to redwood by investors where the entity that originated the loans in question was insolvent 
as a result  while it is possible that we may receive repurchase claims related to these securitizations in the future  redwood cannot make a reasonable estimate of potential future liabilities based on historical experience to date 
we do not currently maintain a loan repurchase reserve and management is not aware of any outstanding repurchase claims against redwood that would require the establishment of such a reserve 
in circumstances where we believe that there is a risk of loss due to a specific loan repurchase demand ie  due to an allegation of a breach of representations and warranties  we will review the need for any loan repurchase reserve in accordance with fasb guidance on accounting for contingencies and establish reserves when  in the opinion of management  it is probable that a matter would result in a liability and the amount of loss  if any  can be reasonably estimated 
in addition  with respect to residential mortgage backed securities issued by sequoia securitization trusts prior to  redwood believes that investors seeking recovery for any losses they incur on investments in these securities may be more likely to pursue remedies through securities related litigation rather than through specific loan repurchase claims 
redwood separately evaluates its exposure to such litigation in establishing its litigation reserves 
for further discussion on litigation related contingencies see note to the financial statements

during the years ended december  and  the reference securities underlying these cds experienced principal losses resulting in a million and million obligation  respectively 
the increase in fair value  net of principal losses  on cds is recognized through market valuation adjustments  net  in our consolidated statements of income loss 
capital resources and liquidity debt at redwood at december   we had million of short term debt collateralized by mortgage backed securities that was used to fund the acquisition of mortgage loans that we intend to securitize 
this debt matured in january  and was subsequently extended though march we had no short term debt at december  
table of contents in  we issued million of long term debt in the form of trust preferred securities through redwood capital trust i  a delaware statutory trust  in a private placement transaction 
these trust preferred securities require quarterly distributions at a floating rate equal to three month libor plus until the notes are redeemed in whole  which will be no later than january  the earliest optional redemption date without a penalty is january  in december  we repurchased thousand principal amount of this trust preferred debt in the open market for thousand and recorded a thousand gain on extinguishment of debt on realized gains which is included in sales and calls  net  on our consolidated statements of income loss 
in  we issued million of long term debt in the form of subordinated notes  which require quarterly distributions at a floating rate equal to three month libor plus until the notes are redeemed  no later than july  the earliest optional redemption date without penalty is july  in july  we repurchased million principal amount of these subordinated notes in the open market at a cost of million  and recorded a million gain on extinguishment of debt on realized gains which is included in sales and calls  net  on our consolidated statements of income loss 
we may from time to time seek to purchase outstanding long term debt in open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions  or otherwise 
any future repurchases would depend on numerous factors including  without limitation  pricing  market conditions  and our capital requirements 
to hedge the variability in our long term debt interest expense  we entered into interest rate swaps with aggregate notional values totaling million during the first quarter of  fixing our gross interest expense yield at 
these swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges with all interest income recorded as a component of net interest income and other valuation changes recorded as a component of equity through the life of the hedge 
asset backed securities issued at other consolidated entities at december   there were billion of loans owned by sequoia securitization entities and reported at cost  which were funded with billion of abs issued by sequoia entities that were also reported at cost 
to date  credit losses have not yet been incurred on any of the senior securities issued by consolidated sequoia securitization entities  although some of these senior securities may incur losses in the future  depending on the magnitude and timing of additional credit losses incurred on the underlying loans 
in april  redwood securitized million of loans through our sequoia program  with approximately million of abs issued to third parties 
at december   there were million of securities owned by acacia securitization entities and reported at fair value  which were funded with million of abs issued by acacia entities that were also reported at fair value

all consolidated abs issued are collateralized by real estate loans and securities 
although the stated maturity is as shown  the abs obligations will pay down as the principal of these real estate loans or securities pay down 
the amount shown is the face value of the abs issued and not necessarily the value reported in our consolidated financial statements 
the anticipated interest payments on consolidated abs issued is calculated based on the contractual maturity of the abs and therefore assumes no prepayments of the principal outstanding as of december  
table of contents potential gaap earnings volatility we expect quarter to quarter gaap earnings volatility from our business activities 
this volatility can occur for a variety of reasons  including the timing and amount of purchases  sales  calls  and repayment of consolidated assets  changes in the fair values of consolidated assets and liabilities  and certain non recurring events 
in addition  the amount or timing of our reported earnings may be impacted by technical accounting issues  some of which are described below 
changes in premium amortization for loans the unamortized premium for loans owned by sequoia and redwood was million at december  the amount of periodic premium amortization expense we recognize is volatile and dependent on a number of factors  including credit performance of the underlying loans  changes in prepayment speeds  and changes in short term interest rates 
loan premium amortization was million in  compared to million in changes in allowance for loan losses for real estate loans classified as held for investment  we establish and maintain an allowance for loan losses based on our estimate of credit losses inherent in our loan portfolios at the reporting date 
to calculate the allowance for loan losses  we assess inherent losses by determining loss factors defaults  loss severities on default liquidations  and the timing of default liquidations that can be specifically applied to each of the consolidated loans or pool of loans 
changes in actual defaults or our expectations on loss severities and default timing can have a significant effect on periodic income 
changes in yields for securities the yields we project on real estate securities can have a significant effect on the periodic interest income we recognize for financial reporting purposes 
yields can vary as a function of credit results  prepayment rates  and interest rates 
if estimated future credit losses are less than our prior estimate  credit losses occur later than expected  or prepayment rates are faster than expected meaning the present value of projected cash flows is greater than previously expected for assets acquired at a discount to face value  the yield over the remaining life of the security may be adjusted upwards 
if estimated future credit losses exceed our prior expectations  credit losses occur more quickly than expected  or prepayments occur more slowly than expected meaning the present value of projected cash flows is less than previously expected for assets acquired at a discount to face value  the yield over the remaining life of the security may be adjusted downward 
changes in the actual maturities of real estate securities may also affect their yields to maturity 
actual maturities are affected by the contractual lives of the associated mortgage collateral  periodic payments of principal  and prepayments of principal 
therefore  actual maturities of afs securities are generally shorter than stated contractual maturities 
stated contractual maturities are generally greater than ten years 
there is no assurance that our assumptions used to estimate future cash flows or the current period s yield for each asset will not change in the near term  and any change could be material 
changes in fair values of securities all securities owned at redwood and consolidated entities are classified as either trading or afs securities  and in both cases are carried on our consolidated balance sheets at their estimated fair values 
for trading securities  changes in fair values are recorded in the consolidated statements of income loss 
periodic fluctuations in the values of these investments are inherently volatile and thus can lead to significant gaap earnings volatility each quarter 
for afs securities  cumulative unrealized gains and losses are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in our consolidated statements of equity 
unrealized gains and losses are not charged against current earnings to the extent they are temporary in nature 
certain factors may require us  however  to recognize these amounts as other than temporary impairments and record them through our current earnings 
factors that determine other than temporary impairment include a change in our ability or intent to hold assets  adverse changes to projected cash flows of assets  or the likelihood that declines in the fair values of assets would not return to their previous levels within a reasonable time 
impairments can lead to significant gaap earnings volatility each quarter 

table of contents changes in fair values of derivative financial instruments we can experience significant earnings volatility from our use of derivatives 
we generally use derivatives to manage risks associated with residential loans we own or plan to acquire and securitize  hedge variability in interest expense indexed to adjustable rates  or hedge cash flows on assets and liabilities that have different coupon rates fixed rates versus floating rates  or floating rates based on different indices 
the nature of the instruments we use and the accounting treatment for the specific assets  liabilities  and derivatives may therefore lead to volatility in our periodic earnings  even when we are meeting our hedging objectives 
some of our derivatives are accounted for as trading instruments with all associated changes in value recorded through our consolidated statements of income loss 
changes in value of the assets and liabilities we manage by using derivatives may not be accounted for similarly 
this could lead to reported income and book values in specific periods that do not necessarily reflect the economics of our risk management strategy 
even when the assets and liabilities are similarly accounted for as trading instruments  periodic changes in their values may not coincide as other market factors eg  supply and demand may affect certain instruments and not others at any given time

our estimated total taxable loss for was million per share and included million in credit losses

we continue to expect credit losses to be the primary factor in our taxable income loss results in in  we declared regular quarterly dividends of per share and declared a total of per share for the year 
as reported  the of dividends paid per share to shareholders for are expected to be characterized as of ordinary income and return of capital 
the portion of our dividends characterized as return of capital is not taxable  and reduces the basis of shares held at each quarterly distribution date 
differences between taxable loss income and gaap income loss differences between taxable loss income and gaap income loss are largely due to the following i we cannot establish loss reserves for future anticipated events for tax but can for gaap as realized credit losses are expensed when incurred for tax and these losses are anticipated through lower yields on assets or through loss provisions for gaap  ii the timing  and possibly the amount  of some expenses eg  compensation expenses are different for tax than for gaap  iii since amortization and impairments differ for tax and gaap  the tax and gaap gains and losses on sales may differ  resulting in differences in realized gains on sale  for tax  we net capital gains on sales against any available capital losses  and  iv for tax  we do not consolidate noncontrolling interests or securitization entities as we do under gaap 
as a result of these differences in accounting  our taxable income can vary significantly from our gaap income during certain reporting periods 
redwood reit s tax basis in its assets and liabilities was billion and billion  respectively  at december  redwood reit s gaap basis in its assets and liabilities was billion and billion  respectively at december  the primary difference in both the tax and gaap assets and liabilities is attributable to securitization entities that are consolidated for gaap reporting purposes but not for tax purposes

table of contents potential taxable income volatility we expect period to period estimated taxable income volatility for a variety of reasons  including those described below 
credit losses on securities and loans to determine estimated taxable income we are generally not permitted to anticipate  or reserve for  credit losses on investments which are generally purchased at a discount 
for tax purposes  we accrue the entire purchase discount on a security into taxable income over the expected life of the security 
estimated taxable income is reduced when actual credit losses occur 
for gaap purposes  we establish a credit reserve and only accrete a portion of the purchase discount  if any  into income and write down securities that become impaired 
our income recognition is therefore faster for tax as compared to gaap  especially in the early years of owning a security when there are generally few credit losses 
at december   the cumulative difference between the gaap and tax amortized cost basis of our residential  commercial  and cdo subordinate securities excluding our investments in the fund and our securitization entities was million 
as we have no credit reserves or allowances for tax  any future credit losses on securities or loans will have a more significant impact on tax earnings than on gaap earnings and may create significant taxable income volatility to the extent the level of credit losses fluctuates during reporting periods 
during the years ended december  and  we realized million and million  respectively  of credit losses on securities for tax that we had previously provisioned for under gaap 
we anticipate that credit losses will continue to be a significant factor for determining taxable income 
credit losses are based on our tax basis  which differs materially from our basis for gaap purposes 
we anticipate an additional million of credit losses for tax on securities  based on our projection of face losses and assuming a similar tax basis as we have recently experienced  although the timing of actual losses is difficult to accurately project 
at december   for gaap we had a designated credit reserve of million on our securities  of which million was a credit reserve for securities at redwood  and an allowance for loan losses of million for our consolidated residential and commercial loans 
recognition of gains and losses on sale since amortization and impairments on assets differ for gaap and tax  the gaap and tax basis on assets sold or called may differ  resulting in differences in gains and losses on sale or call 
in addition  gains realized for tax may be offset by prior capital losses and  thus  not affect taxable income which is what occurred in at december   the reit had million in capital loss carry forwards per share that can be used to offset future capital gains over the next five years 
since our intention is to generally invest in assets for the long term  it is difficult to anticipate when sales may occur and  thus  when or whether we might exhaust these capital loss carry forwards 
prepayments on securities as part of our investment in sequoia securitization entities  we have retained ios at the time they are issued 
our current tax basis in these securities is million 
the return on ios is sensitive to prepayments  and  to the extent prepayments vary period to period  income from these ios will vary 
typically  fast prepayments reduce yields and slow prepayments increase yields 
we are not permitted to recognize a negative yield under tax accounting rules  so during periods of fast prepayments our periodic premium expense for tax purposes can be relatively low and the tax cost basis for these securities may not be significantly reduced 
in periods prior to  we did experience fast prepayments on these loans 
more recently  prepayments have been slowing  and our tax basis is now below the fair values for these ios in the aggregate 
most of our sequoia securitizations are callable or will become callable over the next two years  although we do not currently anticipate calling any sequoia securitizations in the foreseeable future 
if we do call a sequoia securitization  the remaining tax basis in the io is written off  creating an ordinary loss at the call date 

table of contents prepayments also affect the taxable income recognition on other securities we own 
we are required to use particular prepayment assumptions for the remaining lives of each security 
as actual prepayment speeds vary  the yield we recognize for tax purposes will be adjusted accordingly 
thus  to the extent prepayments differ from our long term assumptions or vary from period to period  the yield recognized will also vary and this difference could be material for a specific security 
compensation expense the total tax expense for equity award compensation is dependent upon varying factors such as the timing of payments of dividend equivalent rights  the exercise of stock options  the distribution of deferred stock units and preferred stock units  and the cash deferrals to and withdrawals from our executive deferred compensation plan 
for gaap  the total expense associated with an equity award is determined at the award date and is recognized over the vesting period 
for tax  the total expense is recognized at the date of distribution or exercise  not the award date 
in addition  some compensation may not be deductible for tax if it exceeds certain levels and is not performance based 
thus  the total amount of compensation expense  as well as the timing  could be significantly different for tax than for gaap 
in addition  since the decision to exercise options or distribute deferred stock units  preferred stock units  or cash out of the executive deferred compensation plan is an employee s  it can be difficult to project when the tax expense will occur 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
a discussion of critical accounting policies and the possible effects of changes in estimates on our financial statements is included in note summary of significant accounting policies included in item of this annual report on form k 
management discusses the ongoing development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we seek to manage the market risks inherent in our business including  but not limited to  credit risks  interest rate risks  prepayment risks  liquidity risks  and fair value risks in a prudent manner generally designed to preserve our capital and assist us in our goal of generating stable and increasing earnings and dividends over time 
in general  we seek to assume risks that can be quantified from historical experience  to actively manage such risks  and to maintain capital levels consistent with these risks 
this section presents a general overview of these risks 
additional information concerning the risks we are managing  how these risks are changing over time  and potential gaap earnings and taxable income volatility we may experience as a result of these risks is further discussed in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
credit risk integral to our core business is assuming credit risks of real estate loans through the ownership of residential and commercial real estate loans and securities 
our capital base is primarily employed in owning securities backed by residential and commercial real estate loans  many of which have concentrated credit risks with respect to the underlying real estate loans 
we believe that many of the loans underlying the securities we own are above average in credit quality as compared to us real estate loans in general  although there may nevertheless be significant credit losses related to these loans 
we also take credit risk on residential loans with special risk factors such as interest only and negative amortization residential loan types  and alt a and subprime residential loans 
we also own commercial real estate loans that are not securitized 
credit losses from the loans in securitized loan pools  in general  first reduce the principal value of and economic returns on the subordinate securities in these pools 
credit losses on real estate loans can occur for many reasons  including poor origination practices  fraud  faulty appraisals  documentation errors  poor underwriting  legal errors  poor servicing practices  weak economic conditions  declining values in homes  businesses  or commercial properties  special hazards  earthquakes and other natural events  over leveraging of the borrower or on the property  reduction in market rents and occupancies  poor property management practices  changes in legal protections for lenders  reduction in personal incomes  job losses  and personal events such as divorce or health problems 
in addition  if the us economy or the housing market weakens further than we have anticipated  our credit losses could increase beyond levels that we have anticipated 
credit losses on real estate loans can also occur for reasons not related to the general economy 
with respect to most of the loans securitized by securitization entities sponsored by us and for a portion of the loans underlying residential mortgage backed securities we have acquired from securitizations sponsored by others  the interest rate is adjustable  or may become adjustable after a fixed rate period of two to ten years 
accordingly  when short term interest rates adjust  required monthly payments from homeowners may rise under the terms of these loans  and this may increase borrowers delinquencies and defaults 
we also acquire securities backed by negative amortization adjustable rate loans made to residential borrowers  some of which are prime quality loans while many are alt a quality loans and some are subprime loans 
we invest in these riskier loan types with the expectation of significantly higher delinquencies and losses  as compared to regular amortization loans  but believe these securities offer us the opportunity to generate attractive risk adjusted returns as a result of attractive pricing and the manner in which these securitizations are structured 
nevertheless  there remains substantial uncertainty about the future performance of these assets 
the commercial loans we invest in are generally fixed rate loans 
these loans are generally not fully amortizing in fact  most are interest only and therefore require balloon payments at maturity 
consequently  we are exposed to significant credit risks at the maturity of these loans as the borrower will generally be required to refinance the borrowing with another third party lender at that time 
we consider many factors in our origination process including various exit analyses that may exist at the maturity of these commercial loans 
we manage our credit risks by attempting to understand the extent of the risk we are taking and ensure the appropriate underwriting criteria are met  and we utilize systems and staff to continually monitor the ongoing credit performance of loans and securities 
while we will experience credit losses on residential and 
table of contents commercial loans and securities  to the extent the losses are consistent with the amount and timing of our assumptions we expect to earn attractive returns on our investments 
to the extent we find the credit risks on specific assets are changing adversely  we may be able to take actions which may include selling the assets to mitigate potential losses 
however  we may not always be successful in foreseeing adverse changes in credit performance or in effectively mitigating future credit losses and the ability to sell an asset may be limited due to the structure of the asset or the absence of a market for the asset 
we do not service the underlying loans in securitizations that we invest in  so our efforts to manage credit risks may be limited in those cases 
furthermore  actions we take on loans over which we have some influence or control may not prove to be effective in addressing credit risks that exist 
interest rate risk interest rates and the shape of the yield curve can affect the cash flows and fair values of our assets  liabilities  and interest rate agreements and  consequently  affect our earnings and reported equity 
our general strategy with respect to interest rates is to maintain an asset liability posture including hedges on a consolidated basis that assumes some interest rate risks but not to such a degree that the achievement of our long term goals would likely be affected by changes in interest rates 
we generally do not attempt to completely hedge changes in interest rates and  at times  we may be subject to more interest rate risk than we generally desire in the long term 
prepayment risk unscheduled principal repayments  or prepayments  on loans and securities can affect our gaap earnings primarily through the timing of the amortization of purchase premium and discount or through the triggering of market valuation adjustments 
we seek to maintain an asset liability posture that benefits from investments in prepayment sensitive assets eg  residential mortgages while limiting the risk of adverse prepayment fluctuations to an amount that  in most circumstances  can be absorbed by our capital base while still allowing us to make regular dividend payments 
in general  discount securities benefit from faster prepayment rates on the underlying real estate loans while premium securities such as interest only securities benefit from slower prepayments on the underlying loans 
we are currently positioned in favor of faster prepayment speeds with respect to the long term economic effect of residential loan prepayments on our gaap earnings that is  we have a net discount on our investments 
changes in residential loan prepayment rates will generally result in gaap earnings volatility 
in addition  with respect to securities backed by residential mortgage loans and in particular  interest only securities  changes in prepayment forecasts by market participants could affect the market values of those securities and  thus  could affect our book value and the profits we earn  including profits from securitizing assets 
prepayment rates are difficult to predict or anticipate and variations in prepayment rates can materially affect our earnings and dividend distribution requirements 
prepayment rates on adjustable rate mortgage loans and securities  for example  are driven by many factors  one of which is the steepness of the yield curve 
as the yield curve flattens eg  short term interest rates rise relative to longer term interest rates  prepayments on these investments typically increase 
however  for borrowers who have impaired credit or who otherwise do not meet certain loan underwriting criteria  the ability to refinance ie  prepay their mortgage loan may be limited 
our credit risks can also be affected by prepayments 
for example  credit risks for the securities we own at a discount are reduced each time a loan prepays 
all other factors being equal  faster prepayment rates generally reduce our credit risks on our existing portfolio 
fair value and liquidity risks the securities that we own are generally funded with equity with no associated recourse debt that might affect our liquidity position 
however  we may fund some assets with a combination of short term debt and equity generally prior to securitization that is recourse to redwood 
this generally increases our fair value 
table of contents and liquidity risks 
we manage these risks by maintaining what we believe to be conservative capital levels under our internal risk adjusted capital and risk management policies and by ensuring we have financing facilities available to fund each of these assets 
most of the real estate loans reported on our consolidated balance sheet are accounted for as held for investment and reported at their amortized cost basis 
most of these loans have been sold to sequoia entities and  thus  changes in the fair value of the loans do not have an impact on our liquidity 
however  changes in fair values during the accumulation period while these loans are funded with short term debt before they are sold to a sequoia entity may have a short term effect on our liquidity 
we may also own some real estate loans accounted for as held for sale and adverse changes in their value would be recognized through our income statement and may have an impact on our ability to obtain financing for them 
the securities and abs issued by acacia entities have no recourse to us that would otherwise affect our liquidity position 
however  since they are reported at fair value  changes in the fair values or ratings downgrades of assets owned by an acacia entity may create volatility in our gaap earnings 
our consolidated obligations consist primarily of abs issued 
abs issued by sequoia are reported at amortized cost as are the residential loans collateralizing these abs and  as noted above  abs issued by acacia are reported at fair value 
the resulting net equity within these securitizations assets less liabilities may not necessarily be reflective of the fair value of our interests in these securitization entities 
however  since the abs issued can only look to the cash flows generated by the assets within that securitization for payments of interest and repayments of the face value of the abs  the changes in fair value do not have an effect on redwood s liquidity 
fair value changes could affect the timing of the cash flows we might receive on our investments in the acacia entities 
effect of government actions on our business recent market and economic conditions have been unprecedented and challenging 
there are continuing concerns about the overall economy  the systemic impact of inflation or deflation  energy costs  geopolitical issues  the availability and cost of credit  the us mortgage market  unemployment  and the declining real estate market in the us these market and economic conditions have spurred regulatory reforms  government initiatives and interventions designed to address them 
given the size and scope of the government actions  they will affect many of the market risks described herein  although the total impact is not yet fully known 
as governmental actions are further developed and their effects become more apparent  we will continue to take them into account in managing the risks inherent in our business 
inflation risk virtually all of our consolidated assets and liabilities are financial in nature 
as a result  changes in interest rates and other factors drive our performance 
while changes in interest rates do not necessarily correlate with inflation rates or changes in inflation rates  a risk exists that expectations of future inflation will result in higher benchmark interest rates  thus resulting in additional interest rate risk 

table of contents quantitative information on market risk our future earnings are sensitive to a number of market risk factors and changes in these factors may have a variety of secondary effects that  in turn  will also impact our earnings 
to supplement this discussion on the market risk we face  the following table incorporates information that may be useful in analyzing certain market risks that may affect our consolidated balance sheets at december  the table presents principal cash flows and related average interest rates by year of repayment 
the forward curve future interest rates as implied by the yield structure of debt markets at december   was used to project the average coupon rates for each year presented 
the timing of principal cash flows includes assumptions on the prepayment speeds of assets based on their recent prepayment performance and future prepayment performance consistent with the forward curve 
our future results depend greatly on the credit performance of the underlying loans this table assumes no credit losses  future interest rates  prepayments  and our ability to invest our existing cash and future cash flow
