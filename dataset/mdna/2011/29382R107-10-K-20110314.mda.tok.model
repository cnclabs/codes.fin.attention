item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the years ended december   and and consolidated financial condition as of december  and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this document 
overview we are a diversified spanish language media company with a unique portfolio of television and radio assets that reach hispanic consumers across the united states  as well as the border markets of mexico 
we operate in two reportable segments television broadcasting and radio broadcasting 
our net revenue for the year ended december  was million 
of that amount  revenue generated by our television segment accounted for and revenue generated by our radio segment accounted for 
as of the date of filing this report  we own and or operate primary television stations located primarily in california  colorado  connecticut  florida  massachusetts  nevada  new mexico  texas and washington  dc we own and operate radio stations fm and am located primarily in arizona  california  colorado  florida  nevada  new mexico and texas 
we generate revenue primarilly from sales of national and local advertising time on television and radio stations  and from retransmission consent agreements 
advertising rates are  in large part  based on each medium s ability to attract audiences in demographic groups targeted by advertisers 
we recognize advertising revenue when commercials are broadcast 
we recognize retransmission consent revenue when it is accrued pursuant to the agreements we have entered into with respect to such revenue 
we do not obtain long term commitments from our advertisers and  consequently  they may cancel  reduce or postpone orders without penalties 
we pay commissions to agencies for local  regional and national advertising 
for contracts directly with agencies  we record net revenue from these agencies 
seasonal revenue fluctuations are common in the broadcasting industry and are due primarily to variations in advertising expenditures by both local and national advertisers 
additionally  revenue tends to be affected by the occurrence or non occurrence in a given year of major sporting and political events  such as world cup and major elections 
our primary expenses are employee compensation  including commissions paid to our sales staff and amounts paid to our national representative firms  as well as expenses for marketing  promotion and selling  technical  local programming  engineering  and general and administrative 
our local programming costs for television consist primarily of costs related to producing a local newscast in most of our markets 
the comparability of our results between and is affected by acquisitions and dispositions in those periods 
in those years  we primarily acquired new media properties in markets where we already owned existing media properties 
while new media properties contribute to the financial results of their markets  we do not attempt to measure their effect as they typically are integrated into existing operations 
highlights during  we saw stabilization in advertising  both in television and radio 
our revenues were positively affected by increased advertising  primarily relating to the world cup  political activity and the census 
in addition  we continued to generate increased retransmission consent revenue 
our audience shares remain strong in the nation most densely populated hispanic markets 
nonetheless  we believe that we will continue to face uncertainty in as our advertising customers continue to make difficult choices in the current uncertain economic environment and there is an absence of major sporting events and political activity 

table of contents net revenue for our television segment increased to million in from million in this increase of million  or  in net revenue was primarily due to revenue from political advertising  retransmission consent revenue and revenue from world cup advertising 
we generated million and million in retransmission consent revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we anticipate that retransmission consent revenue will continue to be a growing source of net revenues 
net revenue for our radio segment increased to million in  from million in this increase of million  or  in net revenue was primarily due to revenue from world cup  political and census advertising 
acquisitions and dispositions in april  we acquired the assets of television station kren tv  serving the reno  nevada market for approximately million 
we reduced the carrying value of the assets of television station kren tv to its fair value of million by recording a carrying value adjustment of million 
this charge is included in our consolidated statements of operations for continuing operations 
we evaluated the transferred set of activities  assets  inputs and processes applied to these inputs in this acquisition and determined that the acquisition did not constitute a business 
currently  we are subject to certain limitations on acquisitions under the terms of the indenture and the credit agreement 
please see liquidity and capital resources below 
in a strategic effort to focus our resources on strengthening existing clusters and expanding into new us hispanic markets  we periodically review our portfolio of media properties and  from time to time  seek to divest non core assets in markets where we do not see the opportunity to grow to scale and build out media clusters 
in accordance with this strategy  we sold our outdoor advertising operations in may to lamar advertising co 
for million and we no longer have outdoor advertising operations 
accordingly  our financial statements reflect the outdoor advertising operations as discontinued operations  we have presented the related assets and liabilities as assets held for sale and reclassified the related revenue and expenses as discontinued operations 
relationship with univision substantially all of our television stations are univision or telefutura affiliated television stations 
our network affiliation agreements with univision provide certain of our owned stations the exclusive right to broadcast univision s primary network and telefutura network programming in their respective markets

under the network affiliation agreements  univision acts as our exclusive sales representative for the sale of national and regional advertising sales on our univision and telefutura affiliate television stations  and entravision pays certain sales representation fees to univision relating to national and regional advertising sales 
during the years ended december  and  the amount we paid univision in this capacity was and million  respectively 
in august  we entered into a proxy agreement with univision pursuant to which we granted to univision the right to negotiate the terms of retransmission consent agreements for our univision and telefutura affiliated television station signals for a term of six years 
among other things  the proxy agreement provides terms relating to compensation to be paid to us by univision with respect to retransmission consent agreements entered into with cable and other television service providers

table of contents results of operations separate financial data for each of the company s operating segments is provided below 
segment operating profit loss is defined as operating profit loss before corporate expenses  loss gain on sale of assets and impairment charge 
the company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on the following in thousands years ended december  change to change to net revenue television radio consolidated direct operating expenses television radio consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses television radio consolidated depreciation and amortization television radio consolidated segment operating profit television radio consolidated corporate expenses impairment charge operating income loss consolidated adjusted ebitda capital expenditures television radio consolidated total assets television radio consolidated percentage not meaningful 
consolidated adjusted ebitda means net income loss plus gain loss on sale of assets  depreciation and amortization  non cash impairment charge  non cash stock based compensation included in operating and corporate expenses  net interest expense  loss on debt extinguishment  loss from discontinued operations  
table of contents income tax benefit expense  equity in net income loss of nonconsolidated affiliate  non cash losses and syndication programming amortization less syndication programming payments 
we use the term consolidated adjusted ebitda because that measure is defined in our syndicated bank credit facility and does not include gain loss on sale of assets  depreciation and amortization  non cash impairment charge  non cash stock based compensation  net interest expense  loss on debt extinguishment  loss from discontinued operations  income tax expense benefit  equity in net income loss of nonconsolidated affiliate  non cash losses and syndication programming amortization and does include syndication programming payments 
since our ability to borrow from our credit facility is based on a consolidated adjusted ebitda financial covenant  we believe that it is important to disclose consolidated adjusted ebitda to our investors 
our credit facility contains certain financial covenants relating to the maximum allowed leverage ratio  maximum revolving credit leverage ratio  minimum cash interest coverage ratio and minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
the maximum allowed leverage ratio  or the ratio of consolidated total debt to trailing twelve month consolidated adjusted ebitda  affects our ability to borrow from our credit facility 
under our credit facility  our maximum allowed leverage ratio may not exceed to the actual leverage ratio was as follows in each case as of december  to   to therefore  we were in compliance with this covenant at each of those dates 
we entered into our credit facility in july  so we were not subject to the same calculations and covenants in prior years 
however  for consistency of presentation  the foregoing historical ratios assume that the current covenant had been applicable for all periods presented 
while many in the financial community and we consider consolidated adjusted ebitda to be important  it should be considered in addition to  but not as a substitute for or superior to  other measures of liquidity and financial performance prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  such as cash flows from operating activities  operating income and net income

therefore  we consider both non gaap and gaap measures when evaluating our business 
consolidated adjusted ebitda is also used to make executive compensation decisions 

table of contents consolidated adjusted ebitda is a non gaap measure 
the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to consolidated adjusted ebitda is cash flows from operating activities

consolidated adjusted ebitda consolidated adjusted ebitda as defined below increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
as a percentage of net revenue  consolidated adjusted ebitda increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  we define consolidated adjusted ebitda as net income loss plus gain loss on sale of assets  depreciation and amortization  non cash impairment charge  non cash stock based compensation included in operating and corporate expenses  net interest expense  loss on debt extinguishment  loss from discontinued operations  income tax benefit expense  equity in net income loss of nonconsolidated affiliate  non cash losses and syndication programming amortization less syndication programming payments 
we use the term consolidated adjusted ebitda because that measure is defined in our syndicated bank credit facility and does not include gain loss on sale of assets  non cash depreciation and amortization  non cash impairment charge  non cash stock based compensation  net interest expense  loss on debt extinguishment  loss from discontinued operations  income tax benefit expense  equity in net income loss of nonconsolidated affiliate  non cash losses and syndication programming amortization and does include syndication programming payments 
since our ability to borrow from our credit facility is based on a consolidated adjusted ebitda financial covenant  we believe that it is important to disclose consolidated adjusted ebitda to our investors 
our credit facility contains certain financial covenants relating to the maximum allowed leverage ratio  maximum revolving credit leverage ratio  minimum cash interest coverage ratio and minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
the maximum allowed leverage ratio  or the ratio of consolidated total debt to trailing twelve month consolidated adjusted ebitda  affects our ability to borrow from our credit facility 
under our credit facility  our maximum allowed leverage ratio may not exceed to the actual leverage ratio was as follows in each case as of december  to   to therefore  we were in compliance with this covenant at each of those dates 
we entered into our credit facility in july  so we were not subject to the same calculations and covenants in prior years 
however  for consistency of presentation  the foregoing historical ratios assume that our current definition had been applicable for all periods presented 
while many in the financial community and we consider consolidated adjusted ebitda to be important  it should be considered in addition to  but not as a substitute for or superior to  other measures of liquidity and financial performance prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  such as cash flows from operating activities  operating income and net income 
as consolidated adjusted ebitda excludes non cash gain loss on sale of assets  non cash depreciation and amortization  non cash impairment charge  non cash stock based compensation  net interest expense  loss on debt extinguishment  loss from discontinued operations  income tax benefit expense  equity in net income loss of nonconsolidated affiliate  non cash losses and syndication programming amortization and includes syndication programming payments  consolidated adjusted ebitda has certain limitations because it excludes and includes several important non cash financial line items 
therefore  we consider both non gaap and gaap measures when evaluating our business 
consolidated adjusted ebitda is also used to make executive compensation decisions 
consolidated adjusted ebitda is a non gaap measure

application of critical accounting policies and accounting estimates critical accounting policies are defined as those that are the most important to the accurate portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies require management s subjective judgment and may produce materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we have discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed and approved our related disclosure in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
goodwill we believe that the accounting estimates related to the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite life intangible assets and our estimates of the useful lives of our long lived assets are critical accounting estimates because goodwill and other intangible assets are our most significant assets  and the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on the assets reported on our balance sheet  as well as on our results of operations  could be material 
accordingly  the assumptions about future cash flows on the assets under evaluation are critical goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in each business combination 
we test our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually on the first day of our fourth fiscal quarter  or more frequently if certain events or certain changes in circumstances indicate they may be impaired 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets  we must make a series of assumptions about such things as the estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of these assets 
goodwill impairment testing is a two step process 
the first step is a comparison of the fair values of our reporting units to their respective carrying amounts 
we have determined that each of our operating segments is a reporting unit 
if a reporting unit s estimated fair value is equal to or greater than that reporting unit s carrying value  no impairment of goodwill exists and the testing is complete at the first step 
however  if the reporting unit s carrying amount is greater than the estimated fair value  the second step must be completed to measure the amount of impairment of goodwill  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill with its carrying amount to measure the amount of impairment loss  if 
table of contents any 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill  then an impairment exists and an impairment loss is recorded for the amount of the difference 
as of december   we had million of goodwill in our television reporting unit 
the fair value of our television reporting unit was greater than the carrying value by 
therefore  we do not believe that we are at risk of failing step one of the goodwill impairment test in our television reporting unit for at least the foreseeable future 
if the fair value of our television reporting unit is less than the carrying value in future periods  we would  at that time  have to proceed to the second step of the goodwill impairment testing process 
we wrote down the remaining radio goodwill to during our annual impairment test so we do not have any goodwill in our radio reporting unit at december  the estimated fair value of goodwill is determined by using a combination of a market approach and an income approach 
the market approach estimates fair value by applying sales  earnings and cash flow multiples to each reporting unit s operating performance 
the multiples are derived from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics to our reporting units 
the market approach requires us to make a series of assumptions  such as selecting comparable companies and comparable transactions and transaction premiums 
the current economic conditions have led to a decrease in the number of comparable transactions  which makes the market approach of comparable transactions and transaction premiums more difficult to estimate than in previous years 
the income approach estimates fair value based on our estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit  discounted by an estimated weighted average cost of capital that reflects current market conditions  which reflect the overall level of inherent risk of that reporting unit 
the income approach also requires us to make a series of assumptions  such as discount rates  revenue projections  profit margin projections and terminal value multiples 
we estimated our discount rates on a blended rate of return considering both debt and equity for comparable publicly traded companies in the television and radio industries 
these comparable publicly traded companies have similar size  operating characteristics and or financial profiles to us 
we also estimated the terminal value multiple based on comparable publicly traded companies in the television and radio industries 
we estimated our revenue projections and profit margin projections based on internal forecasts about future performance 
the continuation or worsening of current economic conditions potentially could have an adverse effect on the capital markets  which would affect the discount rate assumptions  terminal value estimates  transaction premiums and comparable transactions 
such economic conditions could also have an adverse effect on the fundamentals of our business and results of operations  which would affect our internal forecasts about future performance and terminal value estimates 
furthermore  such economic conditions could have a negative impact on the advertising industry in general or the industries of those customers who advertise on our stations  including  among others  the automotive  financial and other services  telecommunications  travel and restaurant industries  which in the aggregate provide a significant amount of our historical and projected advertising revenue 
the activities of our competitors  such as other broadcast television stations and radio stations  could have an adverse effect on our internal forecasts about future performance and terminal value estimates 
changes in technology or our audience preferences  including increased competition from other forms of advertising based mediums  such as internet  social media and broadband content providers serving the same markets  could have an adverse effect on our internal forecasts about future performance  terminal value estimates and transaction premiums 
finally  the risk factors that we identify from time to time in our sec reports could have an adverse effect on our internal forecasts about future performance  terminal value estimates and transaction premiums 
given the uncertainties of the current economic environment and the impact it has had  and may continue to have  on our business  there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions made for the purpose of our goodwill impairment testing will prove to be accurate predictions of the future 
if our assumptions regarding internal forecasts of future performance of our business as a whole or of our units are not achieved  if market conditions change and affect the discount rate  or if there are lower comparable transactions and transaction 
table of contents premiums  we may be required to record additional goodwill impairment charges in future periods 
it is not possible at this time to determine if any such future change in our assumptions would have an adverse impact on our valuation models and result in impairment  or if it does  whether such impairment charge would be material 
indefinite life intangible assets we believe that our broadcast licenses are indefinite life intangible assets 
an intangible asset is determined to have an indefinite useful life when there are no legal  regulatory  contractual  competitive  economic or any other factors that may limit the period over which the asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to future cash flows 
the evaluation of impairment for indefinite life intangible assets is performed by a comparison of the asset s carrying value to the asset s fair value 
when the carrying value exceeds fair value  an impairment charge is recorded for the amount of the difference 
the unit of accounting used to test broadcast licenses represents all licenses owned and operated within an individual market cluster  because such licenses are used together  are complimentary to each other and are representative of the best use of those assets 
our individual market clusters consist of cities or nearby cities 
we test our broadcasting licenses for impairment based on certain assumptions about these market clusters 
we wrote down the carrying value of certain broadcast licenses in our television and radio reporting units to fair value during our annual impairment test 
the estimated fair value of indefinite life intangible assets is determined by using an income approach 
the income approach estimates fair value based on the estimated future cash flows of each market cluster that a hypothetical buyer would expect to generate  discounted by an estimated weighted average cost of capital that reflects current market conditions  which reflect the overall level of inherent risk 
the income approach requires us to make a series of assumptions  such as discount rates  revenue projections  profit margin projections and terminal value multiples 
we estimate the discount rates on a blended rate of return considering both debt and equity for comparable publicly traded companies in the television and radio industries 
these comparable publicly traded companies have similar size  operating characteristics and or financial profiles to us 
we also estimated the terminal value multiple based on comparable publicly traded companies in the television and radio industries 
we estimated the revenue projections and profit margin projections based on various market clusters signal coverage of the markets and industry information for an average station within a given market 
the information for each market cluster includes such things as estimated market share  estimated capital start up costs  population  household income  retail sales and other expenditures that would influence advertising expenditures 
alternatively  some stations under evaluation have had limited relevant cash flow history due to planned or actual conversion of format or upgrade of station signal 
the assumptions we make about cash flows after conversion are based on the performance of similar stations in similar markets and potential proceeds from the sale of the assets 
the continuation or worsening of current economic conditions potentially could have an adverse effect on the capital markets  which would affect the discount rate assumptions  terminal value estimates  transaction premiums and comparable transactions 
such economic conditions could also have an adverse effect on the fundamentals of our business and results of operations  which would affect our internal forecasts about future performance and terminal value estimates 
furthermore  such economic conditions could have a negative impact on the advertising industry in general or the industries of those customers who advertise on our stations  including  among others  the automotive  financial and other services  telecommunications  travel and restaurant industries  which in the aggregate provide a significant amount of our historical and projected advertising revenue 
the activities of our competitors  such as other broadcast television stations and radio stations  could have an adverse effect on our internal forecasts about future performance and terminal value estimates 
changes in technology or our audience preferences  including increased competition from other forms of advertising based mediums  such as internet  social media and broadband content providers serving the same markets  could have an adverse effect on our internal forecasts about future performance  terminal value estimates and transaction premiums

table of contents given the uncertainties of the current economic environment and the impact it has had  and may continue to have  on our business  there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions made for the purposes of our impairment testing will prove to be accurate predictions of the future 
if our assumptions regarding internal forecasts of future performance of our business as a whole or of our units are not achieved  if market conditions change and affect the discount rate  or if there are lower comparable transactions and transaction premiums  we may be required to record additional impairment charges in future periods 
it is not possible at this time to determine if any such future change in our assumptions would have an adverse impact on our valuation models and result in impairment  or if it does  whether such impairment charge would be material 
long lived assets  including intangibles subject to amortization depreciation and amortization of our long lived assets is provided using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
changes in circumstances  such as the passage of new laws or changes in regulations  technological advances  changes to our business model or changes in our capital strategy could result in the actual useful lives differing from initial estimates 
in those cases where we determine that the useful life of a long lived asset should be revised  we will depreciate the net book value in excess of the estimated residual value over its revised remaining useful life 
factors such as changes in the planned use of equipment  customer attrition  contractual amendments or mandated regulatory requirements could result in shortened useful lives 
long lived assets and asset groups are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
the estimated future cash flows are based upon  among other things  assumptions about expected future operating performance and may differ from actual cash flows 
long lived assets evaluated for impairment are grouped with other assets to the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities 
if the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows excluding interest is less than the carrying value of the assets  the assets will be written down to the estimated fair value in the period in which the determination is made 
deferred taxes deferred taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and deferred liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences 
temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is determined to be more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment 
we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon settlement 
we recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense 
revenue recognition television and radio revenue related to the sale of advertising is recognized at the time of broadcast 
revenue contracts with advertising agencies are recorded at an amount that is net of the commission retained by the agency 
revenue from contracts that we enter into directly with our advertisers is recorded at gross revenue and the related commission or national representation fee is recorded in operating expense 
cash payments received prior to services rendered result in deferred revenue  which is then recognized as revenue when the advertising time or space is actually provided 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts our accounts receivable consist of a homogeneous pool of relatively small dollar amounts from a large number of customers 
we evaluate the collectibility of our trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors 
when we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  a specific reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount we believe will ultimately be collected 
in addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts  bad debt charges are recorded based on our recent past loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable amounts outstanding 
derivative instruments asc  fair value measurements and disclosures  requires us to recognize all of our derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet at fair value 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship  and further  on the type of hedging relationship 
the carrying amount of our interest rate swap agreements is recorded at fair market value  including non performance risk  and any changes to the value are recorded as an increase or decrease in interest expense 
the fair market value of each interest rate swap agreement is determined by using multiple broker quotes  adjusted for non performance risk  which estimate the future discounted cash flows of any future payments that may be made under such agreements 
for the year ended december   we recognized a decrease of million in interest expense related to the increase in fair value of the interest rate swap agreements 
for the year ended december   the company recognized a decrease of million in interest expense related to the increase in fair value of the interest rate swap agreements 
we terminated the swap agreements effective july   so there is no balance as of december  as of december   the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements was a liability of million and is classified in other liabilities on the balance sheet

sensitivity of critical accounting estimates we have critical accounting estimates that are sensitive to change 
the most significant of those sensitive estimates relate to the impairment of intangible assets 
goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are not amortized but are tested annually on october for impairment  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets  we must make assumptions about the estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of these assets 
television in calculating the estimated fair value of our television reporting unit and fcc licenses  we used models that rely on various assumptions  such as future cash flows  discount rates and multiples 
the estimates of future cash flows assume that the television segment revenues will increase significantly faster than the increase in the television expenses  and therefore the television assets will also increase in value 
if any of the estimates of future cash flows  discount rates  multiples or assumptions were to change in any future valuation  it could affect our impairment analysis and cause us to record an additional expense for impairment
