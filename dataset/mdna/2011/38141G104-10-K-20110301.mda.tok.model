these results reflected significantly lower net revenues in institutional client services and slightly lower net revenues in investment banking compared with these decreases were partially offset by significantly higher net revenues in investing lending and higher net revenues in investment management 
the results of each of our business segments are discussed below 
institutional client services the decrease in institutional client services reflected significantly lower net revenues in fixed income  currency and commodities client execution and  to a lesser extent  equities 
during  fixed income  currency and commodities client execution operated in a challenging environment characterized by lower client activity levels  which reflected broad market concerns including european sovereign debt risk and uncertainty over regulatory reform  as well as tighter bid offer spreads 
the decrease in net revenues compared with a particularly strong primarily reflected significantly lower results in interest rate products  credit products  commodities and  to a lesser extent  currencies 
these decreases were partially offset by higher net revenues in mortgages 
the decline in equities compared with primarily reflected significantly lower net revenues in equities client execution  principally due to significantly lower results in derivatives and shares 
commissions and fees were also lower than  primarily reflecting lower client activity levels 
in addition  securities services net revenues were significantly lower compared with  primarily reflecting tighter securities lending spreads  principally due to the impact of changes in the composition of customer balances  partially offset by the impact of higher average customer balances 
during  although equity markets were volatile during the first half of the year  equity prices generally improved and volatility levels declined in the second half of the year 
see results of operations financial overview below for further information about our calculation of roe 
we believe that presenting our results excluding the impact of the uk bank payroll tax  the sec settlement and the nyse dmm rights impairment is meaningful  as excluding these items increases the comparability of period to period results 
see results of operations financial overview below for further information about our calculation of diluted earnings per common share and roe excluding the impact of these items

results in investing lending for primarily reflected a gain of million from our investment in the ordinary shares of industrial and commercial bank of china limited icbc  a net gain of billion from other equity securities and a net gain of billion from debt securities and loans 
investment management the increase in investment management primarily reflected higher incentive fees across our alternative investment products 
management and other fees also increased  reflecting favorable changes in the mix of assets under management  as well as the impact of appreciation in the value of client assets 
during  assets under management decreased to billion  primarily reflecting outflows in money market assets  consistent with industry trends 
our business  by its nature  does not produce predictable earnings 
our results in any given period can be materially affected by conditions in global financial markets  economic conditions generally and other factors

table of contents critical accounting policies fair value fair value hierarchy 
financial instruments owned  at fair value and financial instruments sold  but not yet purchased  at fair value ie  inventory  as well as certain other financial assets and financial liabilities  are reflected in our consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value ie  marked to market  with related gains or losses generally recognized in our consolidated statements of earnings 
the use of fair value to measure financial instruments is fundamental to our risk management practices and is our most critical accounting policy 
the fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
in determining fair value  the hierarchy under us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap gives i the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level inputs  ii the next priority to inputs other than level inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly level inputs  and iii the lowest priority to inputs that cannot be observed in market activity level inputs 
assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to their fair value measurement 
the fair values for substantially all of our financial assets and financial liabilities  including derivatives  are based on observable prices and inputs and are classified in levels and of the hierarchy 
certain level financial instruments may require appropriate discounts ie  valuation adjustments for factors such as transfer restrictions  the credit quality of a counterparty or the firm  and other premiums and discounts that a market participant would require to arrive at fair value 
valuation adjustments are generally based on market evidence 
instruments categorized within level of the fair value hierarchy  which represent approximately of the firm s total assets  require one or more significant inputs that are not observable 
absent evidence to the contrary  instruments classified within level of the fair value hierarchy are initially valued at transaction price  which is considered to be the best initial estimate of fair value 
subsequent to the transaction date  we use other methodologies to determine fair value  which vary based on the type of instrument 
estimating the fair value of level financial instruments may require judgments to be made 
these judgments include determining the appropriate valuation methodology and or model for each type of level financial instrument  determining model inputs based on an evaluation of all relevant empirical market data  including prices evidenced by market transactions  interest rates  credit spreads  volatilities and correlations  and determining appropriate valuation adjustments related to illiquidity or counterparty credit quality 
regardless of the methodology  valuation inputs and assumptions are only changed when corroborated by substantive evidence 
controls over valuation of financial instruments 
our control infrastructure is independent of the revenue producing units and is fundamental to ensuring that all of our financial instruments are appropriately valued at market clearing levels 
in particular  our independent price verification process is critical to ensuring that financial instruments are properly valued 

table of contents price verification 
the objective of price verification is to have an informed and independent opinion with regard to the valuation of financial instruments under review 
instruments that have one or more significant inputs which cannot be corroborated by external market data are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy 
in situations where there is a question about a valuation  the ultimate valuation is determined by senior managers in control and support functions that are independent of the revenue producing units independent control and support functions 
price verification strategies utilized by our independent control and support functions include trade comparison 
analysis of trade data both internal and external where available is used to determine the most relevant pricing inputs and valuations 
external price comparison 
valuations and prices are compared to pricing data obtained from third parties eg  broker or dealers  markit  bloomberg  idc  trace 
data obtained from various sources is compared to ensure consistency and validity 
when broker or dealer quotations or third party pricing vendors are used for valuation or price verification  greater priority is generally given to executable quotations 
calibration to market comparables 
market based transactions are used to corroborate the valuation of positions with similar characteristics  risks and components 
relative value analyses 
market based transactions are analyzed to determine the similarity  measured in terms of risk  liquidity and return  of one instrument relative to another  or for a given instrument  of one maturity relative to another 
collateral analyses 
margin disputes on derivatives are examined and investigated to determine the impact  if any  on our valuations 
execution of trades 
where appropriate  trading desks are instructed to execute trades in order to provide evidence of market clearing levels 
backtesting 
valuations are corroborated by comparison to values realized upon sales 
see notes through to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this form k for further information about fair value measurements 
review of net revenues 
independent control and support functions ensure adherence to our pricing policy through a combination of daily procedures  one of which is the process of validating and understanding results by attributing and explaining net revenues by the underlying factors 
through this process we independently validate net revenues  identify and resolve potential fair value or trade booking issues on a timely basis and ensure that risks are being properly categorized and quantified 
review of valuation models 
quantitative professionals within our market risk management department market risk management perform an independent model approval process 
this process incorporates a review of a diverse set of model and trade parameters across a broad range of values including extreme and or improbable conditions in order to critically evaluate a model s suitability for valuation and risk management of a particular instrument type  the model s accuracy in reflecting the characteristics of the related product and its significant risks  the suitability and properties of the numerical algorithms incorporated in the model  the model s consistency with models for similar products  and the model s sensitivity to input parameters and assumptions 
new or changed models are reviewed and approved 
models are evaluated and re approved annually to assess the impact of any changes in the product or market and any market developments in pricing theories 
see market risk management and credit risk management for a further discussion of how we manage the risks inherent in our businesses 

table of contents level financial assets at fair value 
the table below presents financial assets measured at fair value and the amount of such assets that are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy 
total level assets were billion and billion as of december and december  respectively 
the decrease in level assets during the year ended december primarily reflected i sales and transfers to level of loans and securities backed by commercial real estate  and ii net reductions in level financial instruments as a result of the consolidations of certain variable interest entities vies 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in derivatives primarily due to unrealized gains on credit derivatives  principally resulting from changes in level inputs

as of december as of december total at level total at level in millions fair value total fair value total commercial paper  certificates of deposit  time deposits and other money market instruments us government and federal agency obligations  non us government obligations   mortgage and other asset backed loans and securities loans and securities backed by commercial real estate loans and securities backed by residential real estate loan portfolios bank loans and bridge loans    corporate debt securities    state and municipal obligations   other debt obligations     equities and convertible debentures   commodities   total cash instruments    derivatives     financial instruments owned  at fair value   securities segregated for regulatory and other purposes  securities purchased under agreements to resell  securities borrowed   receivables from customers and counterparties  total     consists of acquired portfolios of distressed loans  primarily backed by commercial and residential real estate 
includes certain mezzanine financing  leveraged loans arising from capital market transactions and other corporate bank debt 

table of contents goodwill and identifiable intangible assets goodwill 
goodwill is the cost of acquired companies in excess of the fair value of net assets  including identifiable intangible assets  at the acquisition date 
the reorganization of the firm s segments in resulted in the reallocation of assets  including goodwill  and liabilities across our reporting units 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this form k for further information on segments 
we test the goodwill in each of our reporting units for impairment at least annually  by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its estimated net book value 
we derive the fair value based on valuation techniques we believe market participants would use ie  observable price to earnings multiples and price to book multiples 
we derive the net book value by estimating the amount of shareholders equity required to support the activities of each reporting unit 
estimating the fair value of our reporting units requires management to make judgments 
critical inputs include i projected earnings  ii estimated long term growth rates and iii cost of equity 
our last annual impairment test was performed during our fourth quarter and no impairment was identified 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this form k for the carrying value of our goodwill by operating segment 
identifiable intangible assets 
we amortize our identifiable intangible assets over their estimated lives or  in the case of insurance contracts  in proportion to estimated gross profits or premium revenues 
identifiable intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that an asset s or asset group s carrying value may not be fully recoverable 
an impairment loss  generally calculated as the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of an asset or asset group  is recognized if the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows relating to the asset or asset group is less than the corresponding carrying value 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this form k for the carrying value and estimated remaining lives of our identifiable intangible assets by major asset class and the carrying value of our identifiable intangible assets by operating segment 
a prolonged period of market weakness could adversely impact our businesses and impair the value of our identifiable intangible assets 
in addition  certain events could indicate a potential impairment of our identifiable intangible assets  including i changes in trading volumes or market structure that could adversely affect our nyse dmm business see discussion below  ii an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  iii adverse actual experience on the contracts in our variable annuity and life insurance business  iv decreases in cash receipts from television broadcast royalties or v decreases in revenues from commodity related customer contracts and relationships 
management judgment is required to evaluate whether indications of potential impairment have occurred  and to test intangibles for impairment if required 
nyse dmm rights 
during the fourth quarter of  as a result of continuing weak operating results in our nyse dmm business  we tested our nyse dmm rights for impairment in accordance with financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification asc because the carrying value of our nyse dmm rights exceeded the projected undiscounted cash flows over the estimated remaining useful life of our nyse dmm rights  we determined that the rights were impaired 
we recorded an impairment loss of million  which was included in our institutional client services segment in the fourth quarter of this impairment loss represented the excess of the carrying value of our nyse dmm rights over their estimated fair value 
we estimated this fair value  which is a level measurement  using a relative value analysis which incorporated a comparison to another dmm portfolio that was transacted between third parties 
as of december  the carrying value of our nyse dmm rights was million 

table of contents use of estimates the use of generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions 
in addition to the estimates we make in connection with fair value measurements and the accounting for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets  the use of estimates and assumptions is also important in determining provisions for potential losses that may arise from litigation and regulatory proceedings and tax audits 
we estimate and provide for potential losses that may arise out of litigation and regulatory proceedings to the extent that such losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
in accounting for income taxes  we estimate and provide for potential liabilities that may arise out of tax audits to the extent that uncertain tax positions fail to meet the recognition standard under asc see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this form k for further information about accounting for income taxes 
significant judgment is required in making these estimates and our final liabilities may ultimately be materially different 
our total estimated liability in respect of litigation and regulatory proceedings is determined on a case by case basis and represents an estimate of probable losses after considering  among other factors  the progress of each case or proceeding  our experience and the experience of others in similar cases or proceedings  and the opinions and views of legal counsel 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this form k for information on certain judicial  regulatory and legal proceedings 
results of operations the composition of our net revenues has varied over time as financial markets and the scope of our operations have changed 
the composition of net revenues can also vary over the shorter term due to fluctuations in us and global economic and market conditions 
see certain risk factors that may affect our businesses below and risk factors in part i  item a of this form k for a further discussion of the impact of economic and market conditions on our results of operations

regulatory reform on july   the us dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank act was enacted 
the dodd frank act significantly restructures the financial regulatory regime under which we operate 
the implications of the dodd frank act for our businesses will depend to a large extent on the provisions of required future rulemaking by the board of governors of the federal reserve system federal reserve board  the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic  the sec  the us commodity futures trading commission cftc and other agencies  as well as the development of market practices and structures under the regime established by the legislation and the rules adopted pursuant to it 
however  we expect that there will be two principal areas of impact for us the prohibition on proprietary trading and the limitation on the sponsorship of  and investment in  hedge funds and private equity funds by banking entities  including bank holding companies  and increased regulation of and restrictions on over the counter otc derivatives markets and transactions 
in addition  the legislation creates a new systemic risk oversight body to oversee and coordinate the efforts of the primary us financial regulatory agencies in establishing regulations to address financial stability concerns  including more stringent supervisory requirements and prudential standards applicable to systemically important financial institutions 
legal and regulatory changes under consideration in other jurisdictions could also have an impact on our activities in markets outside the united states 
see business regulation in part i  item of this form k for more information 
in light of the dodd frank act  during  we liquidated substantially all of the positions that had been held within principal strategies in our former equities operating segment  as this was a proprietary trading business 
in addition  during the first quarter of  we commenced the liquidation of the positions that had been held by the global macro proprietary trading desk in our former fixed income  currency and commodities operating segment 
net revenues from principal strategies and our global macro proprietary trading desk were not material for the year ended december the full impact of the dodd frank act and other regulatory reforms on our businesses  our clients and the markets in which we operate will depend on the manner in which the relevant authorities develop and implement the required rules and the reaction of market participants to these regulatory developments over the next several years 
we will continue to assess our business  risk management  and compliance practices to conform to developments in the regulatory environment 

table of contents balance sheet and funding sources balance sheet management one of our most important risk management disciplines is our ability to manage the size and composition of our balance sheet 
while our asset base changes due to client activity  market fluctuations and business opportunities  the size and composition of our balance sheet reflect i our overall risk tolerance  ii our ability to access stable funding sources and iii the amount of equity capital we hold 
although our balance sheet fluctuates on a day to day basis  our total assets and adjusted assets at quarterly and year end dates are generally not materially different from those occurring within our reporting periods 
in order to ensure appropriate risk management  we seek to maintain a liquid balance sheet and have processes in place to dynamically manage our assets and liabilities which include quarterly planning  business specific limits  monitoring of key metrics  and scenario analyses 
quarterly planning 
we prepare a quarterly balance sheet plan that combines our projected total assets and composition of assets with our expected funding sources and capital levels for the upcoming quarter 
the objectives of this quarterly planning process are to develop our near term balance sheet projections  taking into account the general state of the financial markets and expected client driven and firm driven activity levels  to ensure that our projected assets are supported by an adequate level and tenor of funding and that our projected capital and liquidity metrics are within management guidelines  and to allow business risk managers and managers from our independent control and support functions to objectively evaluate balance sheet limit requests from business managers in the context of the firm s overall balance sheet constraints 
these constraints include the firm s liability profile and equity capital levels  maturities and plans for new debt and equity issuances  share repurchases  deposit trends and secured funding transactions 
to prepare our quarterly balance sheet plan  business risk managers and managers from our independent control and support functions meet with business managers to review current and prior period metrics and discuss expectations for the upcoming quarter 
the specific metrics reviewed include asset and liability size and composition  aged inventory  limit utilization  risk and performance measures and capital usage 
our consolidated quarterly plan  including our balance sheet plans by business  funding and capital projections  and projected capital and liquidity metrics  is reviewed by the finance committee 
see overview and structure of risk management 
business specific limits 
the finance committee sets asset and liability limits for each business and aged inventory limits for certain financial instruments as a disincentive to hold inventory over longer periods of time 
these limits are set at levels which are close to actual operating levels in order to ensure prompt escalation and discussion among business managers and managers in our independent control and support functions on a routine basis 
the finance committee reviews and approves balance sheet limits on a quarterly basis and may also approve changes in limits on an ad hoc basis in response to changing business needs or market conditions 

table of contents monitoring of key metrics 
we monitor key balance sheet metrics daily both by business and on a consolidated basis  including asset and liability size and composition  aged inventory  limit utilization  risk measures and capital usage 
in our consolidated balance sheet  we allocate assets to businesses and review and analyze movements resulting from new business activity as well as market fluctuations 
scenario analyses 
we conduct scenario analyses to determine how we would manage the size and composition of our balance sheet and maintain appropriate funding  liquidity and capital positions in a variety of situations these scenarios cover one year and two year time horizons using various macro economic and firm specific assumptions 
we use these analyses to assist us in developing longer term funding plans  including the level of unsecured debt issuances  the size of our secured funding program and the amount and composition of our equity capital 
we also consider any potential future constraints  such as limits on our ability to grow our asset base in the absence of appropriate funding 
through our internal capital adequacy assessment process icaap and our resolution and recovery planning  we further analyze how we would manage our balance sheet through the duration of a severe crisis and we develop plans for mitigating actions to access funding  generate liquidity  and or redeploy equity capital  as appropriate 
balance sheet allocation in addition to preparing our consolidated statement of financial condition in accordance with us gaap  we prepare a balance sheet that generally allocates assets to our businesses 
we believe that presenting our assets on this basis is meaningful because it is consistent with the way management views and manages risks associated with the firm s assets and better enables investors to assess the liquidity of the firm s assets 
the table below presents a summary of this balance sheet allocation 
as of in millions december excess liquidity global core excess other cash excess liquidity and cash secured client financing inventory secured financing agreements receivables institutional client services icbc equity excluding icbc debt receivables and other investing lending total inventory and related assets other assets total assets 
table of contents the following is a description of the captions in the table above 
excess liquidity and cash 
we maintain substantial excess liquidity to meet a broad range of potential cash outflows and collateral needs in the event of a stressed environment 
see liquidity risk below for details on the composition and sizing of our excess liquidity pool or global core excess gce 
in addition to our excess liquidity  we maintain other operating cash balances  primarily for use in specific currencies  entities  or jurisdictions where we do not have immediate access to parent company liquidity 
secured client financing 
we provide collateralized financing for client positions  including margin loans secured by client collateral  securities borrowed  and resale agreements primarily collateralized by government obligations 
as a result of client activities  we are required to segregate cash and securities to satisfy regulatory requirements 
our secured client financing arrangements  which are generally short term  are accounted for at fair value or at amounts that approximate fair value  and include daily margin requirements to mitigate counterparty credit risk 
institutional client services 
in institutional client services  we maintain inventory positions to facilitate market making in fixed income  equity  currency and commodity products 
additionally  as part of client market making activities  we enter into resale or securities borrowing arrangements to obtain securities which we can use to cover transactions in which we or our clients have sold securities that have not yet been purchased 
the receivables in institutional client services primarily relate to securities transactions 
investing lending 
in investing lending  we make investments and originate loans to provide financing to clients 
these investments and loans are typically longer term in nature 
we make investments  directly and indirectly through funds that we manage  in debt securities  loans  public and private equity securities  real estate and other investments 
other assets 
other assets are generally less liquid  non financial assets  including property  leasehold improvements and equipment  goodwill and identifiable intangible assets  income tax related receivables  equity method investments and miscellaneous receivables

in the tables below  total assets for institutional client services and investing lending represent the inventory and related assets

table of contents less liquid inventory composition 
we seek to maintain a liquid balance sheet comprised of assets that can be readily funded on a secured basis 
however  we do hold certain financial instruments that may be more difficult to fund on a secured basis  especially during times of market stress 
we focus on funding these assets with longer contractual maturities to reduce the need to refinance in periods of market stress and generally hold higher levels of total capital for these assets than for more liquid types of financial instruments 
the table below presents our aggregate holdings in these categories of financial instruments 
as of december in millions mortgage and other asset backed loans and securities bank loans and bridge loans emerging market debt securities high yield and other debt obligations private equity investments and real estate fund investments emerging market equity securities icbc ordinary shares smfg convertible preferred stock other restricted public equity securities other investments in funds includes funded commitments and inventory held in connection with our origination  investing and market making activities

balance sheet analysis and metrics as of december  total assets on our consolidated statement of financial condition were billion  an increase of billion from december this increase is primarily due to i an increase in collateralized agreements of billion and an increase in cash and securities segregated for regulatory and other purposes of billion  both primarily due to an increase in client driven activity  and ii an increase in financial instruments owned  at fair value of billion  primarily due to increases in physical commodities and us government and federal agency obligations 
as of december  total liabilities on our consolidated statement of financial condition were billion  an increase of billion from december this increase is primarily due to i an increase in securities sold under agreements to repurchase of billion  primarily due to an increase in secured funding of our financial instruments owned  at fair value  and an increase in client driven activity  ii an increase in other secured financings of billion  primarily due to client driven activity and iii an increase in financial instruments sold  but not yet purchased  at fair value of billion  primarily due to increases in non us government obligations and equities and convertible debentures 
as of december  our total securities sold under agreements to repurchase  accounted for as collateralized financings  were billion  which was higher and higher than the daily average amount of repurchase agreements during the quarter ended and year ended december  respectively 
as of december  the increase in our repurchase agreements relative to the daily average during the quarter and year was due to an increase in client driven activity at the end of the year and an increase in firm financing activities 
as of december our total securities sold under agreements to repurchase  accounted for as collateralized financings  were billion  which was lower and lower than the daily average amount of repurchase agreements during the quarter ended and year ended december  respectively 
the level of our repurchase agreements fluctuates between and within periods  primarily due to providing clients with access to highly liquid collateral  such as us government  federal agency and investment grade sovereign obligations through collateralized financing activities 

table of contents the table below presents information on our assets  shareholders equity and leverage ratios 
as of december in millions  except per share amounts total assets adjusted assets total shareholders equity leverage ratio x x adjusted leverage ratio x x debt to equity ratio x x adjusted assets 
adjusted assets equals total assets less i low risk collateralized assets generally associated with our secured client financing transactions and federal funds sold and ii cash and securities we segregate for regulatory and other purposes 
the table below presents the reconciliation of total assets to adjusted assets 
as of december in millions total assets deduct securities borrowed securities purchased under agreements to resell and federal funds sold add financial instruments sold  but not yet purchased  at fair value less derivative liabilities subtotal deduct cash and securities segregated for regulatory and other purposes adjusted assets leverage ratio 
the leverage ratio equals total assets divided by total shareholders equity and measures the proportion of equity and debt the firm is using to finance assets 
this ratio is different from the tier leverage ratio included in equity capital consolidated regulatory capital ratios below  and further described in note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this form k 
adjusted leverage ratio 
the adjusted leverage ratio equals adjusted assets divided by total shareholders equity 
we believe that the adjusted leverage ratio is a more meaningful measure of our capital adequacy than the leverage ratio because it excludes certain low risk collateralized assets that are generally supported with little or no capital 
our adjusted leverage ratio decreased to x as of december from x as of december primarily because our total shareholders equity grew at a higher rate than our adjusted assets 
although total assets increased by during the period  this growth was principally comprised of increases in low risk assets primarily securities purchased under agreements to resell and cash and securities segregated for regulatory and other purposes  which do not impact our adjusted assets 
debt to equity ratio 
the debt to equity ratio equals unsecured long term borrowings divided by total shareholders equity 
funding sources our primary sources of funding are secured financings  unsecured long term and short term borrowings  and deposits 
we seek to maintain broad and diversified funding sources globally 
we raise funding through a number of different products  including collateralized financings  such as repurchase agreements  securities loaned and other secured financings  long term unsecured debt through syndicated us registered offerings  us registered and a medium term note programs  offshore medium term note offerings and other debt offerings  short term unsecured debt through us and us commercial paper and promissory note issuances and other methods  and demand and savings deposits through cash sweep programs and time deposits through internal and third party broker networks 
we generally distribute our funding sources through our own sales force to a large  diverse creditor base in a variety of markets in the americas  europe and asia 
we believe that our relationships with our creditors are critical to our liquidity 
our creditors include banks  governments  securities lenders  pension funds  insurance companies  mutual funds and individuals 
we have imposed various internal guidelines to monitor creditor concentration across our primary funding programs 

table of contents secured funding 
we fund a significant amount of our inventory on a secured basis 
we believe secured funding is more stable than unsecured financing because it is less sensitive to changes in our credit quality due to the nature of the collateral we post to our lenders 
however  because the terms or availability of secured funding  particularly short dated funding  can deteriorate rapidly in a difficult environment  we generally do not rely on short dated secured funding unless it is collateralized with highly liquid securities such as government obligations 
substantially all of our other secured funding is executed for tenors of one month or greater 
additionally  we monitor counterparty concentration and hold a portion of our gce for refinancing risk associated with all secured funding transactions 
we seek longer terms for secured funding collateralized by lower quality assets because these funding transactions may pose greater refinancing risk 
the weighted average maturity of our secured funding  excluding funding collateralized by highly liquid securities eligible for inclusion in our gce  exceeded days as of december a majority of our secured funding for securities not eligible for inclusion in the gce is executed through term repurchase agreements and securities lending contracts 
we also raise financing through other types of collateralized financings  such as secured loans and notes 
unsecured long term borrowings 
we issue unsecured long term borrowings as a source of capital to meet our long term financing requirements and to finance a portion of our gce 
we issue in different tenors  currencies  and products to maximize the diversification of our investor base 
the table below presents our quarterly unsecured long term borrowings maturity profile through as of december unsecured long term borrowings maturity profile in millions 
table of contents the weighted average maturity of our unsecured long term borrowings as of december was approximately seven years 
to mitigate refinancing risk  we seek to limit the principal amount of debt maturing on any one day or during any week or year 
we enter into interest rate swaps to convert a substantial portion of our long term borrowings into floating rate obligations in order to minimize our exposure to interest rates 
temporary liquidity guarantee program tlgp 
as of december  we had billion of senior unsecured debt outstanding comprised of billion of short term and billion of long term guaranteed by the fdic under the tlgp  all of which will mature on or prior to june  we have not issued long term debt under the tlgp since march and the program has expired for new issuances 
unsecured short term borrowings 
a significant portion of our short term borrowings were originally long term debt that is scheduled to mature within one year of the reporting date 
we use short term borrowings to finance liquid assets and for other cash management purposes 
we primarily issue commercial paper  promissory notes  and other hybrid instruments 
we prefer issuing promissory notes  in which we do not make a market  over commercial paper  which we may repurchase prior to maturity through the ordinary course of business as a market maker 
as of december  our unsecured short term borrowings  including the current portion of unsecured long term borrowings  were billion 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this form k for further information about our unsecured short term borrowings 
deposits 
as of december  our bank depository institution subsidiaries had billion in customer deposits  including billion of certificates of deposit and other time deposits with a weighted average maturity of three years  and billion of other deposits  substantially all of which were from cash sweep programs 
we utilize deposits to finance lending activities in our bank subsidiaries and to support potential outflows  such as lending commitments 
goldman sachs bank usa gs bank usa has access to funding through the federal reserve bank discount window 
while we do not rely on this funding in our liquidity planning and stress testing  we maintain policies and procedures necessary to access this funding and test discount window borrowing procedures 
equity capital the level and composition of our equity capital are determined by multiple factors including our consolidated regulatory capital requirements and icaap  and may also be influenced by other factors such as rating agency guidelines  subsidiary capital requirements  the business environment  conditions in the financial markets and assessments of potential future losses due to adverse changes in our business and market environments 
in addition  we maintain a contingency capital plan which provides a framework for analyzing and responding to an actual or perceived capital shortfall 
our consolidated regulatory capital requirements are determined by the federal reserve board  as described below 
our icaap incorporates an internal risk based capital assessment designed to identify and measure material risks associated with our business activities  including market risk  credit risk and operational risk  in a manner that is closely aligned with our risk management practices 
our internal risk based capital assessment is supplemented with the results of stress tests 
as of december  our total shareholders equity was billion consisting of common shareholders equity of billion and preferred stock of billion 
as of december  our total shareholders equity was billion consisting of common shareholders equity of billion and preferred stock of billion 
in addition to total shareholders equity  we consider our billion of junior subordinated debt issued to trusts to be part of our equity capital  as it qualifies as capital for regulatory and certain rating agency purposes 
see consolidated regulatory capital ratios below for information regarding the impact of regulatory developments 

table of contents consolidated regulatory capital the federal reserve board is the primary regulator of group inc  a bank holding company and a financial holding company under the us bank holding company act of as a bank holding company  we are subject to consolidated regulatory capital requirements that are computed in accordance with the federal reserve board s capital adequacy regulations currently applicable to bank holding companies basel 
these capital requirements  which are based on the capital accord of the basel committee on banking supervision basel committee  are expressed as capital ratios that compare measures of capital to risk weighted assets rwas 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this form k for additional information regarding the firm s rwas 
the firm s capital levels are also subject to qualitative judgments by its regulators about components  risk weightings and other factors 
federal reserve board regulations require bank holding companies to maintain a minimum tier capital ratio of and a minimum total capital ratio of 
the required minimum tier capital ratio and total capital ratio in order to be considered a well capitalized bank holding company under the federal reserve board guidelines are and  respectively 
bank holding companies may be expected to maintain ratios well above the minimum levels  depending upon their particular condition  risk profile and growth plans 
the minimum tier leverage ratio is for bank holding companies that have received the highest supervisory rating under federal reserve board guidelines or that have implemented the federal reserve board s risk based capital measure for market risk 
other bank holding companies must have a minimum tier leverage ratio of 
consolidated regulatory capital ratios the table below presents information about our regulatory capital ratios 
as of december in millions common shareholders equity less goodwill less disallowable intangible assets less other deductions tier common capital preferred stock junior subordinated debt issued to trusts tier capital qualifying subordinated debt less other deductions tier capital total capital risk weighted assets tier capital ratio total capital ratio tier leverage ratio tier common ratio principally includes equity investments in non financial companies and the cumulative change in the fair value of our unsecured borrowings attributable to the impact of changes in our own credit spreads  disallowed deferred tax assets  and investments in certain nonconsolidated entities 
substantially all of our subordinated debt qualifies as tier capital for basel purposes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this form k for additional information about the firm s rwas and tier leverage ratio 
the tier common ratio equals tier common capital divided by rwas 
we believe that the tier common ratio is meaningful because it is one of the measures that we and investors use to assess capital adequacy 
our tier capital ratio increased to as of december from as of december the growth in our tier capital during the year ended december was principally due to an increase in our shareholders equity  which was partially offset by an increase in our rwas 
our tier leverage ratio increased to as of december from as of december  reflecting an increase in our tier capital  principally due to an increase in our shareholders equity  which was partially offset by an increase in average adjusted total assets 

table of contents we are currently working to implement the requirements set out in the federal reserve board s capital adequacy guidelines for bank holding companies internal ratings based and advanced measurement approaches  which are based on the advanced approaches under the revised framework for the international convergence of capital measurement and capital standards issued by the basel committee as applicable to us as a bank holding company basel 
us banking regulators have incorporated the basel framework into the existing risk based capital requirements by requiring that internationally active banking organizations  such as us  transition to basel following the successful completion of a parallel run 
in addition  the basel committee has undertaken a program of substantial revisions to its capital guidelines 
in particular  the changes in the basel guidelines will result in increased capital requirements for market risk  additionally  the basel guidelines issued by the basel committee in december revise the definition of tier capital  introduce tier common equity as a regulatory metric  set new minimum capital ratios including a new capital conservation buffer  which must be composed exclusively of tier common equity and will be in addition to the other capital ratios  introduce a tier leverage ratio within international guidelines for the first time  and make substantial revisions to the computation of rwas for credit exposures 
implementation of the new requirements is expected to take place over an extended transition period  starting at the end of for basel and end of for basel 
although the us federal banking agencies have now issued proposed rules that are intended to implement certain aspects of the basel guidelines  they have not yet addressed all aspects of those guidelines or the basel changes 
in addition  both the basel committee and us banking regulators implementing the dodd frank act have indicated that they will impose more stringent capital standards on systemically important financial institutions 
although the criteria for treatment as a systemically important financial institution have not yet been determined  it is probable that they will apply to us 
therefore  the regulations ultimately applicable to us may be substantially different from those that have been published to date 
the dodd frank act will subject us at a firmwide level to the same leverage and risk based capital requirements that apply to depository institutions and directs banking regulators to impose additional capital requirements as disclosed above 
the federal reserve board will be required to begin implementing the new leverage and risk based capital regulation by january as a consequence of these changes  tier capital treatment for our junior subordinated debt issued to trusts and our cumulative preferred stock will be phased out over a three year period beginning on january  the interaction between the dodd frank act and the basel committee s proposed changes adds further uncertainty to our future capital requirements 
a number of other governmental entities and regulators  including the us treasury  the european union and the financial services authority in the united kingdom  have also proposed or announced changes which will result in increased capital requirements for financial institutions 
as a consequence of these developments  we expect minimum capital ratios required to be maintained under federal reserve board regulations will be increased and changes in the prescribed calculation methodology are expected to result in higher rwas and lower capital ratios than those currently computed 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this form k for additional information about our regulatory capital ratios and the related regulatory requirements 
internal capital adequacy assessment process we perform an icaap with the objective of ensuring that the firm is appropriately capitalized relative to the risks in our business 
as part of our icaap  we perform an internal risk based capital assessment 
our internal risk based capital assessment incorporates market risk  credit risk and operational risk 
market risk is calculated by using value at risk var calculations supplemented by risk based add ons which include risks related to rare events tail risks 
credit risk utilizes assumptions about our counterparties probability of default  the size of our losses in the event of a default and the maturity of our counterparties contractual obligations to us 
operational risk is calculated based on scenarios incorporating multiple types of operational failures 
backtesting is used to gauge the effectiveness of models at capturing and measuring relevant risks 

table of contents we evaluate capital adequacy based on the result of our internal risk based capital assessment  supplemented with the results of stress tests which measure the firm s performance under various market conditions 
our goal is to hold sufficient capital  under our internal risk based capital framework  to ensure we remain adequately capitalized after experiencing a severe stress event 
our assessment of capital adequacy is viewed in tandem with our assessment of liquidity adequacy and integrated into the overall risk management structure  governance and policy framework of the firm 
we attribute capital usage to each of our businesses based upon our internal risk based capital and regulatory frameworks and manage the levels of usage based upon the balance sheet and risk limits established 
rating agency guidelines the credit rating agencies assign credit ratings to the obligations of group inc  which directly issues or guarantees substantially all of the firm s senior unsecured obligations 
gs bank usa has also been assigned long term issuer ratings as well as ratings on its long term and short term bank deposits 
in addition  credit rating agencies have assigned ratings to debt obligations of certain other subsidiaries of group inc the level and composition of our equity capital are among the many factors considered in determining our credit ratings 
each agency has its own definition of eligible capital and methodology for evaluating capital adequacy  and assessments are generally based on a combination of factors rather than a single calculation 
see liquidity risk credit ratings for further information about our credit ratings 
subsidiary capital requirements many of our subsidiaries  including gs bank usa and our broker dealer subsidiaries  are subject to separate regulation and capital requirements in jurisdictions throughout the world 
for purposes of assessing the adequacy of its capital  gs bank usa has established an icaap which is similar to that used by group inc gs bank usa s capital levels and prompt corrective action classification are subject to qualitative judgments by its regulators about components  risk weightings and other factors 
we expect that the capital requirements of several of our subsidiaries will be impacted in the future by the various developments arising from the basel committee  the dodd frank act  and other governmental entities and regulators 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this form k for information about gs bank usa s capital ratios under basel as implemented by the federal reserve board  and for further information about the capital requirements of our other regulated subsidiaries and the potential impact of regulatory reform 
subsidiaries not subject to separate regulatory capital requirements may hold capital to satisfy local tax guidelines  rating agency requirements for entities with assigned credit ratings or internal policies  including policies concerning the minimum amount of capital a subsidiary should hold based on its underlying level of risk 
in certain instances  group inc may be limited in its ability to access capital held at certain subsidiaries as a result of regulatory  tax or other constraints 
as of december and december  group inc s equity investment in subsidiaries was billion and billion  respectively  compared with its total shareholders equity of billion and billion  respectively 
group inc has guaranteed the payment obligations of gs co  gs bank usa  goldman sachs bank europe plc and gsec subject to certain exceptions 
in november  we contributed subsidiaries into gs bank usa  and group inc agreed to guarantee certain losses  including credit related losses  relating to assets held by the contributed entities 
in connection with this guarantee  group inc also agreed to pledge to gs bank usa certain collateral  including interests in subsidiaries and other illiquid assets 
our capital invested in non us subsidiaries is generally exposed to foreign exchange risk  substantially all of which is managed through a combination of derivatives and non us denominated debt 

table of contents preferred stock 
in october  we issued to berkshire hathaway and certain affiliates  shares of cumulative perpetual preferred stock  series g series g preferred stock  and a five year warrant to purchase up to million shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share  for aggregate proceeds of billion 
the allocated carrying values of the warrant and the series g preferred stock based on their relative fair values on the date of issuance were billion and billion  respectively 
the series g preferred stock is redeemable at the firm s option  subject to the approval of the federal reserve board  at a redemption value of billion  plus accrued and unpaid dividends 
accordingly  upon a redemption in full at any time in the future of the series g preferred stock  we would recognize a one time preferred dividend of billion calculated as the difference between the carrying value and redemption value of the preferred stock  which would be recorded as a reduction to our earnings applicable to common shareholders and to our common shareholders equity in the period of redemption 
based on our december average diluted common shares outstanding and basic shares outstanding  the estimated impact to earnings per common share and book value per common share would be a reduction of approximately and  respectively  in the period in which the redemption occurs in the future 
contingency capital plan our contingency capital plan outlines the appropriate communication procedures to follow during a crisis period  including internal dissemination of information as well as ensuring timely communication with external stakeholders 
it also provides a framework for analyzing and responding to a perceived or actual capital deficiency  including  but not limited to  identification of drivers of a capital deficiency  as well as mitigants and potential actions 
equity capital management our objective is to maintain a sufficient level and optimal composition of equity capital 
we principally manage our capital through issuances and repurchases of our common stock 
we may also  from time to time  issue or repurchase our preferred stock  junior subordinated debt issued to trusts and other subordinated debt as business conditions warrant and subject to any regulatory approvals 
we manage our capital requirements principally by setting limits on balance sheet assets and or limits on risk  in each case both at the consolidated and business levels 
we attribute capital usage to each of our businesses based upon our internal risk based capital and regulatory frameworks and manage the levels of usage based upon the balance sheet and risk limits established 
share repurchase program 
we seek to use our share repurchase program to substantially offset increases in share count over time resulting from employee share based compensation and to help maintain the appropriate level of common equity 
the repurchase program is effected primarily through regular open market purchases  the amounts and timing of which are determined primarily by our issuance of shares resulting from employee share based compensation as well as our current and projected capital position ie  comparisons of our desired level of capital to our actual level of capital  but which may also be influenced by general market conditions and the prevailing price and trading volumes of our common stock 
as of december  under the board s existing share repurchase program  we can repurchase up to million additional shares of common stock  however  any such repurchases are subject to the approval of the federal reserve board

table of contents tangible common shareholders equity 
tangible common shareholders equity equals total shareholders equity less preferred stock  goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
tangible book value per common share is computed by dividing tangible common shareholders equity by the number of common shares outstanding  including restricted stock units rsus granted to employees with no future service requirements 
we believe that tangible common shareholders equity and tangible book value per common share are meaningful because they are measures that we and investors use to assess capital adequacy

off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations off balance sheet arrangements we have various types of off balance sheet arrangements that we enter into in the ordinary course of business 
our involvement in these arrangements can take many different forms  including purchasing or retaining residual and other interests in special purpose entities such as mortgage backed and other asset backed securitization vehicles  holding senior and subordinated debt  interests in limited and general partnerships  and preferred and common stock in other nonconsolidated vehicles  entering into interest rate  foreign currency  equity  commodity and credit derivatives  including total return swaps  entering into operating leases  and providing guarantees  indemnifications  loan commitments  letters of credit and representations and warranties 
we enter into these arrangements for a variety of business purposes  including securitizations 
the securitization vehicles that purchase mortgages  corporate bonds  and other types of financial assets are critical to the functioning of several significant investor markets  including the mortgage backed and other asset backed securities markets  since they offer investors access to specific cash flows and risks created through the securitization process 
we also enter into these arrangements to underwrite client securitization transactions  provide secondary market liquidity  make investments in performing and nonperforming debt  equity  real estate and other assets  provide investors with credit linked and asset repackaged notes  and receive or provide letters of credit to satisfy margin requirements and to facilitate the clearance and settlement process 
our financial interests in  and derivative transactions with  such nonconsolidated entities are accounted for at fair value  in the same manner as our other financial instruments  except in cases where we apply the equity method of accounting 
when we transfer a security that has very little  if any  default risk under an agreement to repurchase the security where the maturity date of the repurchase agreement matches the maturity date of the underlying security such that we effectively no longer have a repurchase obligation and we have relinquished control over the underlying security  we record such transactions as sales 
these transactions are referred to as repos to maturity 
we had no such transactions outstanding as of december or december

our occupancy expenses include costs associated with office space held in excess of our current requirements 
this excess space  the cost of which is charged to earnings as incurred  is being held for potential growth or to replace currently occupied space that we may exit in the future 
we regularly evaluate our current and future space capacity in relation to current and projected staffing levels 
for the year ended december  total occupancy expenses for space held in excess of our current requirements were million  which includes costs related to the transition to our new headquarters in new york city 
in addition  in  we incurred exit costs of million  related to our office space included in occupancy and depreciation and amortization in the consolidated statements of earnings 
we may incur exit costs in the future to the extent we i reduce our space capacity or ii commit to  or occupy  new properties in the locations in which we operate and  consequently  dispose of existing space that had been held for potential growth 
these exit costs may be material to our results of operations in a given period 
overview and structure of risk management overview we believe that effective risk management is of primary importance to the success of the firm 
accordingly  we have comprehensive risk management processes through which we monitor  evaluate and manage the risks we assume in conducting our activities 
these include market  credit  liquidity  operational  legal  regulatory and reputational risk exposures 
our risk management framework is built around three core components governance  processes and people 
governance 
risk management governance starts with our board  which plays an important role in reviewing and approving risk management policies and practices  both directly and through its risk committee  which consists of all of our independent directors 
the board also receives periodic updates on firmwide risks from our independent control and support functions 
next  at the most senior levels of the firm  our leaders are experienced risk managers  with a sophisticated and detailed understanding of the risks we take 
our senior managers lead and participate in risk oriented committees  as do the leaders of our independent control and support functions including those in internal audit  compliance  controllers  credit risk management  human capital management  legal  market risk management  operations  operational risk management  tax  technology and treasury 
the firm s governance structure provides the protocol and responsibility for decision making on risk management issues and ensures implementation of those decisions 
we make extensive use of risk related committees that meet regularly and serve as an important means to facilitate and foster ongoing discussions to identify  manage and mitigate risks 

table of contents we maintain strong communication about risk and we have a culture of collaboration in decision making among the revenue producing units  independent control and support functions  committees and senior management 
while we believe that the first line of defense in managing risk rests with the managers in our revenue producing units  we dedicate extensive resources to independent control and support functions in order to ensure a strong oversight structure and an appropriate segregation of duties 
processes 
we maintain various processes and procedures that are critical components of our risk management 
first and foremost is our daily discipline of marking substantially all of the firm s inventory to current market levels 
goldman sachs carries its inventory at fair value  with changes in valuation reflected immediately in our risk management systems and in net revenues 
we do so because we believe this discipline is one of the most effective tools for assessing and managing risk and that it provides transparent and realistic insight into our financial exposures 
we also apply a rigorous framework of limits to control risk across multiple transactions  products  businesses and markets 
this includes setting credit and market risk limits at a variety of levels and monitoring these limits on a daily basis 
limits are typically set at levels that will be periodically exceeded  rather than at levels which reflect our maximum risk appetite 
this fosters an ongoing dialogue on risk among revenue producing units  independent control and support functions  committees and senior management  as well as rapid escalation of risk related matters 
see market risk management and credit risk management for further information on our risk limits 
active management of our positions is another important process 
proactive mitigation of our market and credit exposures minimizes the risk that we will be required to take outsized actions during periods of stress 
we also focus on the rigor and effectiveness of the firm s risk systems 
the goal of our risk management technology is to get the right information to the right people at the right time  which requires systems that are comprehensive  reliable and timely 
we devote significant time and resources to our risk management technology to ensure that it consistently provides us with complete  accurate and timely information 
people 
even the best technology serves only as a tool for helping to make informed decisions in real time about the risks we are taking 
ultimately  effective risk management requires our people to make ongoing portfolio interpretations and adjustments 
in both our revenue producing units and our independent control and support functions  the experience of our professionals  and their understanding of the nuances and limitations of each risk measure  guide the firm in assessing exposures and maintaining them within prudent levels 
structure ultimate oversight of risk is the responsibility of the firm s board 
the board oversees risk both directly and through its risk committee 
within the firm  a series of committees with specific risk management mandates have oversight or decision making responsibilities for risk management activities 
committee membership generally consists of senior managers from both our revenue producing units and our independent control and support functions 
we have established procedures for these committees to ensure that appropriate information barriers are in place 
our primary risk committees  most of which also have additional sub committees or working groups  are described below 
in addition to these committees  we have other risk oriented committees which provide oversight for different businesses  activities  products  regions and legal entities 
membership of the firm s risk committees is reviewed regularly and updated to reflect changes in the responsibilities of the committee members 
accordingly  the length of time that members serve on the respective committees varies as determined by the relevant committee charter or the committee chairs  and based on the responsibilities of the members within the firm 
in addition  independent control and support functions  which report to the chief financial officer  general counsels  chief administrative officer  or in the case of internal audit  to the audit committee of the board  are responsible for day to day oversight of risk  as discussed in greater detail in the following sections

table of contents liquidity risk liquidity is of critical importance to financial institutions 
most of the recent failures of financial institutions have occurred in large part due to insufficient liquidity 
accordingly  the firm has in place a comprehensive and conservative set of liquidity and funding policies to address both firm specific and broader industry or market liquidity events 
our principal objective is to be able to fund the firm and to enable our core businesses to continue to generate revenues  even under adverse circumstances 
we manage liquidity risk according to the following principles excess liquidity 
we maintain substantial excess liquidity to meet a broad range of potential cash outflows and collateral needs in a stressed environment 
asset liability management 
we assess anticipated holding periods for our assets and their potential illiquidity in a stressed environment 
we manage the maturities and diversity of our funding across markets  products and counterparties  and seek to maintain liabilities of appropriate tenor relative to our asset base 
contingency funding plan 
we maintain a contingency funding plan to provide a framework for analyzing and responding to a liquidity crisis situation or periods of market stress 
this framework sets forth the plan of action to fund normal business activity in emergency and stress situations 
these principles are discussed in more detail below 
excess liquidity our most important liquidity policy is to pre fund our estimated potential cash needs during a liquidity crisis and hold this excess liquidity in the form of unencumbered  highly liquid securities and cash instruments 
we believe that this global core excess would be readily convertible to cash in a matter of days  through liquidation  by entering into repurchase agreements or from maturities of reverse repurchase agreements  and that this cash would allow us to meet immediate obligations without needing to sell other assets or depend on additional funding from credit sensitive markets 
as of december and december  the fair value of the securities and certain overnight cash deposits included in our gce totaled billion and billion  respectively 
based on the results of our internal liquidity risk model  discussed below  as well as our consideration of other factors including but not limited to a qualitative assessment of the condition of the financial markets and the firm  we believe our liquidity position as of december was appropriate 
beginning with the fourth quarter of  our gce  which was previously reported at loan value  is now reported at fair value 
the differences between the loan value and fair value were not material and prior periods are presented on a comparable basis 
the table below presents the fair value of the securities and certain overnight cash deposits that are included in our gce 
average for the year ended december in millions us dollar denominated non us dollar denominated total the us dollar denominated excess is composed of unencumbered us government obligations  us agency obligations and highly liquid us agency mortgage backed obligations  all of which are eligible as collateral in federal reserve open market operations and certain overnight us dollar cash deposits 
the us dollar denominated excess is composed of only unencumbered french  german  united kingdom and japanese government obligations and certain overnight cash deposits in highly liquid currencies 
we strictly limit our excess liquidity to this narrowly defined list of securities and cash because they are highly liquid  even in a difficult funding environment 
we do not include other potential sources of excess liquidity  such as lower quality unencumbered securities or committed credit facilities  in our gce 

table of contents the table below presents the fair value of our gce by asset class 
average for the year ended december in millions overnight cash deposits federal funds sold us government obligations us federal agency obligations and highly liquid us federal agency mortgage backed obligations french  german  united kingdom and japanese government obligations total the gce is held at group inc and our major broker dealer and bank subsidiaries  as presented in the table below 
average for the year ended december in millions group inc major broker dealer subsidiaries major bank subsidiaries total our gce reflects the following principles the first days or weeks of a liquidity crisis are the most critical to a company s survival 
focus must be maintained on all potential cash and collateral outflows  not just disruptions to financing flows 
our businesses are diverse  and our liquidity needs are determined by many factors  including market movements  collateral requirements and client commitments  all of which can change dramatically in a difficult funding environment 
during a liquidity crisis  credit sensitive funding  including unsecured debt and some types of secured financing agreements  may be unavailable  and the terms eg  interest rates  collateral provisions and tenor or availability of other types of secured financing may change 
as a result of our policy to pre fund liquidity that we estimate may be needed in a crisis  we hold more unencumbered securities and have larger debt balances than our businesses would otherwise require 
we believe that our liquidity is stronger with greater balances of highly liquid unencumbered securities  even though it increases our total assets and our funding costs 
we believe that our gce provides us with a resilient source of funds that would be available in advance of potential cash and collateral outflows and gives us significant flexibility in managing through a difficult funding environment 
in order to determine the appropriate size of our gce  we use an internal liquidity model  referred to as the modeled liquidity outflow  which captures and quantifies the firm s liquidity risks 
we also consider other factors including but not limited to a qualitative assessment of the condition of the financial markets and the firm 
we distribute our gce across subsidiaries  asset types  and clearing agents to provide us with sufficient operating liquidity to ensure timely settlement in all major markets  even in a difficult funding environment 
we maintain our gce to enable us to meet current and potential liquidity requirements of our parent company  group inc  and our major broker dealer and bank subsidiaries 
the modeled liquidity outflow incorporates a consolidated requirement as well as a standalone requirement for each of our major broker dealer and bank subsidiaries 
liquidity held directly in each of these subsidiaries is intended for use only by that subsidiary to meet its liquidity requirements and is assumed not to be available to group inc unless i legally provided for and ii there are no additional regulatory  tax or other restrictions 
we hold a portion of our gce directly at group inc to support consolidated requirements not accounted for in the major subsidiaries 
in addition to the gce held at our major broker dealer and bank subsidiaries  we maintain operating cash balances in several of our other operating entities  primarily for use in specific currencies  entities  or jurisdictions where we do not have immediate access to parent company liquidity 
in addition to our gce  we have a significant amount of other unencumbered cash and financial instruments  including other government obligations  high grade money market securities  corporate obligations  marginable equities  loans and cash deposits not included in our gce 
the fair value of these assets averaged billion and billion for the years ended december and december  respectively 
we do not consider these assets liquid enough to be eligible for our gce liquidity pool and therefore conservatively do not assume we will generate liquidity from these assets in a short term stress scenario 

table of contents modeled liquidity outflow 
our modeled liquidity outflow is based on a scenario that includes both a market wide stress and a firm specific stress  characterized by some or all of the following elements global recession  default by a medium sized sovereign  low consumer and corporate confidence  and general financial instability 
severely challenged market environment with material declines in equity markets and widening of credit spreads 
damaging follow on impacts to financial institutions leading to the failure of a large bank 
a firm specific crisis potentially triggered by material losses  reputational damage  litigation  executive departure  and or a ratings downgrade 
the following are the critical modeling parameters of the modeled liquidity outflow liquidity needs over a day scenario 
a two notch downgrade of the firm s long term senior unsecured credit ratings 
no support from government funding facilities 
although we have access to various central bank funding programs  we do not assume reliance on them as a source of funding in a liquidity crisis 
a combination of contractual outflows  such as upcoming maturities of unsecured debt  and contingent outflows eg  actions though not contractually required  we may deem necessary in a crisis 
we assume that most contingent outflows will occur within the initial days and weeks of a crisis 
no diversification benefit across liquidity risks 
we assume that liquidity risks are additive 
maintenance of our normal business levels 
we do not assume asset liquidation  other than the gce 
the modeled liquidity outflow is calculated and reported to senior management on a daily basis 
we regularly refine our model to reflect changes in market or economic conditions and the firm s business mix 
the potential contractual and contingent cash and collateral outflows covered in our modeled liquidity outflow include unsecured funding contractual all upcoming maturities of unsecured long term debt  commercial paper  promissory notes and other unsecured funding products 
we assume that we will be unable to issue new unsecured debt or rollover any maturing debt 
contingent repurchases of our outstanding long term debt  commercial paper and hybrid financial instruments in the ordinary course of business as a market maker 
deposits contractual all upcoming maturities of term deposits 
we assume that we will be unable to raise new term deposits or rollover any maturing term deposits 
contingent withdrawals of bank deposits that have no contractual maturity 
the withdrawal assumptions reflect  among other factors  the type of deposit  whether the deposit is insured or uninsured  and the firm s relationship with the depositor 
secured funding contractual a portion of upcoming contractual maturities of secured funding trades due to either the inability to refinance or the ability to refinance only at wider haircuts ie  on terms which require us to post additional collateral 
our assumptions reflect  among other factors  the quality of the underlying collateral and counterparty concentration 
contingent a decline in value of financial assets pledged as collateral for financing transactions  which would necessitate additional collateral postings under those transactions 
otc derivatives contingent collateral postings to counterparties due to adverse changes in the value of our otc derivatives 
contingent other outflows of cash or collateral related to otc derivatives  including the impact of trade terminations  collateral substitutions  collateral disputes  collateral calls or termination payments required by a two notch downgrade in our credit ratings  and collateral that has not been called by counterparties  but is available to them 
exchange traded derivatives contingent variation margin postings required due to adverse changes in the value of our outstanding exchange traded derivatives 
contingent an increase in initial margin and guaranty fund requirements by derivative clearing houses 
customer cash and securities contingent liquidity outflows associated with our prime brokerage business  including withdrawals of customer credit balances  and a reduction in customer short positions  which serve as a funding source for long positions 

table of contents unfunded commitments contingent draws on our unfunded commitments 
draw assumptions reflect  among other things  the type of commitment and counterparty 
other other upcoming large cash outflows  such as tax payments 
asset liability management our liquidity risk management policies are designed to ensure we have a sufficient amount of financing  even when funding markets experience persistent stress 
we seek to maintain a long dated and diversified funding profile  taking into consideration the characteristics and liquidity profile of our assets 
our approach to asset liability management includes conservatively managing the overall characteristics of our funding book  with a focus on maintaining long term  diversified sources of funding in excess of our current requirements 
see balance sheet and funding sources funding sources for additional details 
actively managing and monitoring our asset base  with particular focus on the liquidity  holding period and our ability to fund assets on a secured basis 
this enables us to determine the most appropriate funding products and tenors 
less liquid assets are more difficult to fund and therefore require funding that has longer tenors with a greater proportion of unsecured debt 
for more detail on our balance sheet management process  please see balance sheet and funding sources balance sheet management 
raising secured and unsecured financing that has a sufficiently longer term than the anticipated holding period of our assets 
this reduces the risk that our liabilities will come due in advance of our ability to generate liquidity from the sale of our assets 
because we maintain a highly liquid balance sheet  the holding period of certain of our assets may be materially shorter than their contractual maturity dates 
our goal is to have sufficient total capital unsecured long term borrowings plus total shareholders equity so that we can avoid reliance on asset sales other than our gce 
however  we recognize that orderly asset sales may be prudent or necessary in a severe or persistent liquidity crisis 
the target amount of our total capital is based on an internal funding model which incorporates the following long term financing requirements the portion of financial instruments owned  at fair value that we believe could not be funded on a secured basis in periods of market stress  assuming stressed fair values 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets  property  leasehold improvements and equipment  and other illiquid assets 
derivative and other margin and collateral requirements 
anticipated draws on our unfunded loan commitments 
regulatory requirements to hold capital or other forms of financing in excess of what we would otherwise hold in regulated subsidiaries 
subsidiary funding policies 
the majority of our unsecured funding is raised by group inc which lends the necessary funds to its subsidiaries  some of which are regulated  to meet their asset financing  liquidity and capital requirements 
in addition  group inc provides its regulated subsidiaries with the necessary capital to meet their regulatory requirements 
the benefits of this approach to subsidiary funding are enhanced control and greater flexibility to meet the funding requirements of our subsidiaries 
funding is also raised at the subsidiary level through a variety of products  including secured funding  unsecured borrowings and deposits 
our intercompany funding policies assume that  unless legally provided for  a subsidiary s funds or securities are not freely available to its parent company or other subsidiaries 
in particular  many of our subsidiaries are subject to laws that authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to group inc regulatory action of that kind could impede access to funds that group inc needs to make payments on its obligations 
accordingly  we assume that the capital provided to our regulated subsidiaries is not available to group inc or other subsidiaries and any other financing provided to our regulated subsidiaries is not available until the maturity of such financing 

table of contents group inc has provided substantial amounts of equity and subordinated indebtedness  directly or indirectly  to its regulated subsidiaries 
for example  as of december  group inc had billion of equity and subordinated indebtedness invested in gs co  its principal us registered broker dealer  billion invested in gsi  a regulated uk broker dealer  billion invested in goldman sachs execution clearing  lp  a lp registered broker dealer  billion invested in goldman sachs japan co  ltd  a regulated japanese broker dealer  and billion invested in gs bank usa  a regulated new york state chartered bank 
group inc also had billion of unsubordinated loans and billion of collateral provided to these entities as of december and significant amounts of capital invested in and loans to its other regulated subsidiaries 
contingency funding plan the goldman sachs contingency funding plan sets out the plan of action we would use to fund business activity in crisis situations and periods of market stress 
the contingency funding plan outlines a list of potential risk factors  key reports and metrics that are reviewed on an ongoing basis to assist in assessing the severity of  and managing through  a liquidity crisis and or market dislocation 
the contingency funding plan also describes in detail the firm s potential responses if our assessments indicate that the firm has entered a liquidity crisis  which include pre funding for what we estimate will be our potential cash and collateral needs as well as utilizing secondary sources of liquidity 
mitigants and action items to address specific risks which may arise are also described and assigned to individuals responsible for execution 
the contingency funding plan identifies key groups of individuals to foster effective coordination  control and distribution of information  all of which are critical in the management of a crisis or period of market stress 
the contingency funding plan also details the responsibilities of these groups and individuals  which include making and disseminating key decisions  coordinating all contingency activities throughout the duration of the crisis or period of market stress  implementing liquidity maintenance activities and managing internal and external communication

table of contents we rely on the short term and long term debt capital markets to fund a significant portion of our day to day operations and the cost and availability of debt financing is influenced by our credit ratings 
credit ratings are also important when we are competing in certain markets  such as otc derivatives  and when we seek to engage in longer term transactions 
see certain risk factors that may affect our businesses  and risk factors in part i  item a of this form k for a discussion of the risks associated with a reduction in our credit ratings 
we believe our credit ratings are primarily based on the credit rating agencies assessment of our liquidity  market  credit and operational risk management practices  the level and variability of our earnings  our capital base  our franchise  reputation and management  our corporate governance  and the external operating environment  including the assumed level of government support 
we allocate a portion of our gce to ensure we would be able to make the additional collateral or termination payments that may be required in the event of a two notch reduction in our long term credit ratings  as well as collateral that has not been called by counterparties  but is available to them 
the table below presents the additional collateral or termination payments that could have been called at the reporting date by counterparties in the event of a one notch and two notch downgrade in our credit ratings 
as of december in millions additional collateral or termination payments for a one notch downgrade additional collateral or termination payments for a two notch downgrade the basel committee on banking supervision s international framework for liquidity risk measurement  standards and monitoring calls for imposition of a liquidity coverage ratio  designed to ensure that the banking entity maintains an adequate level of unencumbered high quality liquid assets based on expected cash outflows under an acute liquidity stress scenario  and a net stable funding ratio  designed to promote more medium and long term funding of the assets and activities of banking entities over a one year time horizon 
the liquidity coverage ratio would be implemented subject to an observation period beginning in  but would not be introduced as a requirement until january   and the net stable funding ratio would not be introduced as a requirement until january  while the principles behind the new framework are broadly consistent with our current liquidity management framework  it is possible that the implementation of these standards could impact our liquidity and funding requirements and practices 
cash flows as a global financial institution  our cash flows are complex and bear little relation to our net earnings and net assets 
consequently  we believe that traditional cash flow analysis is less meaningful in evaluating our liquidity position than the excess liquidity and asset liability management policies described above 
cash flow analysis may  however  be helpful in highlighting certain macro trends and strategic initiatives in our businesses 
year ended december our cash and cash equivalents increased by billion to billion at the end of we generated billion in net cash from financing activities primarily from net proceeds from issuances of short term secured financings 
we used net cash of billion for operating and investing activities  primarily to fund an increase in securities purchased under agreements to resell and an increase in cash and securities segregated for regulatory and other purposes  partially offset by cash generated from a decrease in securities borrowed 
year ended december our cash and cash equivalents increased by billion to billion at the end of we generated billion in net cash from operating activities 
we used net cash of billion for investing and financing activities  primarily for net repayments in unsecured and secured short term borrowings and the repurchases of series h preferred stock and the related common stock warrant from the us treasury  partially offset by an increase in bank deposits and the issuance of common stock 

table of contents market risk management overview market risk is the risk of loss in the value of our inventory due to changes in market prices 
we hold inventory primarily for market making for our clients and for our investing and lending activities 
our inventory therefore changes based on client demands and our investment opportunities 
our inventory is accounted for at fair value and therefore fluctuates on a daily basis 
categories of market risk include the following interest rate risk primarily results from exposures to changes in the level  slope and curvature of yield curves  the volatilities of interest rates  mortgage prepayment speeds and credit spreads 
equity price risk results from exposures to changes in prices and volatilities of individual equities  baskets of equities and equity indices 
currency rate risk results from exposures to changes in spot prices  forward prices and volatilities of currency rates 
commodity price risk results from exposures to changes in spot prices  forward prices and volatilities of commodities  such as electricity  natural gas  crude oil  petroleum products  and precious and base metals 
market risk management process we manage our market risk by diversifying exposures  controlling position sizes and establishing economic hedges in related securities or derivatives 
this includes accurate and timely exposure information incorporating multiple risk metrics  a dynamic limit setting framework  and constant communication among revenue producing units  risk managers and senior management 
market risk management  which is independent of the revenue producing units and reports to the firm s chief risk officer  has primary responsibility for assessing  monitoring and managing market risk at the firm 
we monitor and control risks through strong firmwide oversight and independent control and support functions across the firm s global businesses 
managers in revenue producing units are accountable for managing risk within prescribed limits 
these managers have in depth knowledge of their positions  of markets and the instruments available to hedge their exposures 
managers in revenue producing units and market risk management discuss market information  positions and estimated risk and loss scenarios on an ongoing basis 
risk measures market risk management produces risk measures and monitors them against market risk limits set by our firm s risk committees 
these measures reflect an extensive range of scenarios and the results are aggregated at trading desk  business and firmwide levels 
we use a variety of risk measures to estimate the size of potential losses for both moderate and more extreme market moves over both short term and long term time horizons 
risk measures used for shorter term periods include var and sensitivity metrics 
for longer term horizons  our primary risk measures are stress tests 
our risk reports detail key risks  drivers and changes for each desk and business  and are distributed daily to senior management of both our revenue producing units and our independent control and support functions 
systems we have made a significant investment in technology to monitor market risk including an independent calculation of var and stress measures  risk measures calculated at individual position levels  attribution of risk measures to individual risk factors of each position  the ability to report many different views of the risk measures eg  by desk  business  product type or legal entity  and the ability to produce ad hoc analyses in a timely manner 

table of contents value at risk var is the potential loss in value of inventory positions due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon with a specified confidence level 
we typically employ a one day time horizon with a confidence level 
thus  we would expect to see reductions in the fair value of inventory positions at least as large as the reported var once per month 
the var model captures risks including interest rates  equity prices  currency rates and commodity prices 
as such  var facilitates comparison across portfolios of different risk characteristics 
var also captures the diversification of aggregated risk at the firmwide level 
inherent limitations to var include var does not estimate potential losses over longer time horizons where moves may be extreme 
var does not take account of the relative liquidity of different risk positions 
previous moves in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of all future market moves 
the historical data used in our var calculation is weighted to give greater importance to more recent observations and reflect current asset volatilities 
this improves the accuracy of our estimates of potential loss 
as a result  even if our inventory positions were unchanged  our var would increase with increasing market volatility and vice versa 
given its reliance on historical data  var is most effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are no sudden fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions 
we evaluate the accuracy of our var model through daily backtesting ie  comparing daily trading net revenues to the var measure calculated as of the prior business day at the firmwide level and for each of our businesses and major regulated subsidiaries 
var does not include positions that are best measured and monitored using sensitivity measures  and the impact of changes in counterparty and our own credit spreads on derivatives as well as changes in our own credit spreads on unsecured borrowings for which the fair value option was elected 
stress testing we use stress testing to examine risks of specific portfolios as well as the potential impact of significant risk exposures across the firm 
we use a variety of scenarios to calculate the potential loss from a wide range of market moves on the firm s portfolios 
these scenarios include the default of single corporate or sovereign entities  the impact of a move in a single risk factor across all positions eg  equity prices or credit spreads or a combination of two or more risk factors 
unlike var measures  which have an implied probability because they are calculated at a specified confidence level  there is generally no implied probability that our stress test scenarios will occur 
instead  stress tests are used to model both moderate and more extreme moves in underlying market factors 
when estimating potential loss  we generally assume that our positions cannot be reduced or hedged although experience demonstrates that we are generally able to do so 
stress test scenarios are conducted on a regular basis as part of the firm s routine risk management process and on an ad hoc basis in response to market events or concerns 
stress testing is an important part of the firm s risk management process because it allows us to highlight potential loss concentrations  undertake risk reward analysis  and assess and mitigate our risk positions 
limits we use risk limits at various levels in the firm including firmwide  product and business to govern risk appetite by controlling the size of our exposures to market risk 
limits are reviewed frequently and amended on a permanent or temporary basis to reflect changing market conditions  business conditions or tolerance for risk 
the firmwide risk committee sets market risk limits at firmwide and product levels and our securities division risk committee sets sub limits for market making and investing activities at a business level 
the purpose of the firmwide limits is to assist senior management in controlling the firm s overall risk profile 
sub limits set the desired maximum amount of exposure that may be managed by any particular business on a day to day basis without additional levels of senior management approval  effectively leaving day to day trading decisions to individual desk managers and traders 
accordingly  sub limits are a management tool designed to ensure appropriate escalation rather than to establish maximum risk tolerance 
sub limits also distribute risk among various businesses in a manner that is consistent with their level of activity and client demand  taking into account the relative performance of each area 

table of contents our market risk limits are monitored daily by market risk management  which is responsible for identifying and escalating  on a timely basis  instances where limits have been exceeded 
the business level limits that are set by the securities division risk committee are subject to the same scrutiny and limit escalation policy as the firmwide limits 
when a risk limit has been exceeded eg  due to changes in market conditions  such as increased volatilities or changes in correlations  it is reported to the appropriate risk committee and a discussion takes place with the relevant desk managers  after which either the risk position is reduced or the risk limit is temporarily or permanently increased 
metrics we analyze var at the firmwide level and a variety of more detailed levels  including by risk category  business  and region 
the tables below present average daily var and year end var by risk category 
average daily var year ended in millions december december november risk categories interest rates equity prices currency rates commodity prices diversification effect total equals the difference between total var and the sum of the vars for the four risk categories 
this effect arises because the four market risk categories are not perfectly correlated 
our average daily var decreased to million in from million in  principally due to a decrease in the interest rates category which was primarily due to reduced exposures  lower levels of volatility and tighter spreads 
our average daily var increased to million in from million in  principally due to an increase in the interest rates category and a reduction in the diversification benefit across risk categories  partially offset by a decrease in the commodity prices category 
the increase in the interest rates category was primarily due to wider spreads 
the decrease in the commodity prices category was primarily due to lower energy prices 
year end var and high and low var year ended in millions as of december december risk categories high low interest rates equity prices currency rates commodity prices diversification effect total equals the difference between total var and the sum of the vars for the four risk categories 
this effect arises because the four market risk categories are not perfectly correlated 
our daily var decreased to million as of december from million as of december  principally due to a decrease in the equity prices and interest rates categories  partially offset by a decrease in the diversification benefit across risk categories 
the decreases in the equity prices and interest rates categories were primarily due to reduced exposures and lower levels of volatility 
during the year ended december  the firmwide var risk limit was exceeded on one occasion in order to facilitate a client transaction and was resolved by a reduction in the risk position on the following day 
separately  during the year ended december  the firmwide var risk limit was reduced on one occasion reflecting lower risk utilization 
during the year ended december  the firmwide var risk limit was exceeded on two successive days 
it was resolved by a reduction in the risk position without a permanent or temporary var limit increase 
separately  during the year ended december  the firmwide var risk limit was raised on one occasion and reduced on two occasions as a result of changes in the risk utilization and the market environment 

table of contents the chart below reflects the var over the last four quarters 
the chart below presents the frequency distribution of our daily trading net revenues for substantially all inventory positions included in var for the year ended december as noted above  daily trading net revenues are compared with var calculated as of the end of the prior business day

table of contents credit risk management overview credit risk represents the potential for loss due to the default or deterioration in credit quality of a counterparty eg  an otc derivatives counterparty or a borrower or an issuer of securities or other instruments we hold 
our exposure to credit risk comes mostly from client transactions in otc derivatives and loans and lending commitments 
credit risk also comes from cash placed with banks  securities financing transactions ie  resale and repurchase agreements and securities borrowing and lending activities and receivables from brokers  dealers  clearing organizations  customers and counterparties 
credit risk management  which is independent of the revenue producing units and reports to the firm s chief risk officer  has primary responsibility for assessing  monitoring and managing credit risk at the firm 
the credit policy committee and the firmwide risk committee establish and review credit policies and parameters 
in addition  we hold other positions that give rise to credit risk eg  bonds held in our inventory and secondary bank loans 
these credit risks are captured as a component of market risk measures  which are monitored and managed by market risk management  consistent with other inventory positions 
policies authorized by the firmwide risk committee and the credit policy committee prescribe the level of formal approval required for the firm to assume credit exposure to a counterparty across all product areas  taking into account any enforceable netting provisions  collateral or other credit risk mitigants 
credit risk management process effective management of credit risk requires accurate and timely information  a high level of communication and knowledge of customers  countries  industries and products 
our process for managing credit risk includes approving transactions and setting and communicating credit exposure limits  monitoring compliance with established credit exposure limits  assessing the likelihood that a counterparty will default on its payment obligations  measuring the firm s current and potential credit exposure and losses resulting from counterparty default  reporting of credit exposures to senior management  the board and regulators  use of credit risk mitigants  including collateral and hedging  and communication and collaboration with other independent control and support functions such as operations  legal and compliance 
as part of the risk assessment process  credit risk management performs credit reviews which include initial and ongoing analyses of our counterparties 
a credit review is an independent judgment about the capacity and willingness of a counterparty to meet its financial obligations 
for substantially all of our credit exposures  the core of our process is an annual counterparty review 
a counterparty review is a written analysis of a counterparty s business profile and financial strength resulting in an internal credit rating which represents the probability of default on financial obligations to the firm 
the determination of internal credit ratings incorporates assumptions with respect to the counterparty s future business performance  the nature and outlook for the counterparty s industry  and the economic environment 
senior personnel within credit risk management  with expertise in specific industries  inspect and approve credit reviews and internal credit ratings 
our global credit risk management systems capture credit exposure to individual counterparties and on an aggregate basis to counterparties and their subsidiaries economic groups 
these systems also provide management with comprehensive information on our aggregate credit risk by product  internal credit rating  industry  country and region 
risk measures and limits we measure our credit risk based on the potential loss in an event of non payment by a counterparty 
for derivatives and securities financing transactions  the primary measure is potential exposure  which is our estimate of the future exposure that could arise over the life of a transaction based on market movements within a specified confidence level 
potential exposure takes into account netting and collateral arrangements 
for loans and lending commitments  the primary measure is a function of the notional amount of the position 
we also monitor credit risk in terms of current exposure  which is the amount presently owed to the firm after taking into account applicable netting and collateral 

table of contents we use credit limits at various levels counterparty  economic group  industry  country to control the size of our credit exposures 
limits for counterparties and economic groups are reviewed regularly and revised to reflect changing appetites for a given counterparty or group of counterparties 
limits for industries and countries are based on the firm s risk tolerance and are designed to allow for regular monitoring  review  escalation and management of credit risk concentrations 
stress tests scenario analysis we use regular stress tests to calculate the credit exposures  including potential concentrations that would result from applying shocks to counterparty credit ratings or credit risk factors eg  currency rates  interest rates  equity prices 
these shocks include a wide range of moderate and more extreme market movements 
some of our stress tests include shocks to multiple risk factors  consistent with the occurrence of a severe market or economic event 
unlike potential exposure  which is calculated within a specified confidence level  with a stress test there is generally no assumed probability of these events occurring 
we run stress tests on a regular basis as part of our routine risk management processes and conduct tailored stress tests on an ad hoc basis in response to market developments 
stress tests are regularly conducted jointly with the firm s market and liquidity risk functions 
risk mitigants to reduce our credit exposures on derivatives and securities financing transactions  we may enter into netting agreements with counterparties that permit us to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties 
we may also reduce credit risk with counterparties by entering into agreements that enable us to obtain collateral from them on an upfront or contingent basis and or to terminate transactions if the counterparty s credit rating falls below a specified level 
for loans and lending commitments  we typically employ a variety of potential risk mitigants  depending on the credit quality of the borrower and other characteristics of the transaction 
risk mitigants include collateral provisions  guarantees  covenants  structural seniority of the bank loan claims and  for certain lending commitments  provisions in the legal documentation that allow the firm to adjust loan amounts  pricing  structure and other terms as market conditions change 
the type and structure of risk mitigants employed can significantly influence the degree of credit risk involved in a loan 
when we do not have sufficient visibility into a counterparty s financial strength or when we believe a counterparty requires support from its parent company  we may obtain third party guarantees of the counterparty s obligations 
we may also mitigate our credit risk using credit derivatives or participation agreements 
credit exposures the firm s credit exposures are described further below 
cash and cash equivalents 
cash and cash equivalents include both interest bearing and non interest bearing deposits 
to mitigate the risk of credit loss  we place substantially all of our deposits with highly rated banks and central banks 
otc derivatives 
derivatives are reported on a net by counterparty basis ie  the net payable or receivable for derivative assets and liabilities for a given counterparty when a legal right of setoff exists under an enforceable netting agreement 
derivatives are accounted for at fair value net of cash collateral received or posted under credit support agreements 
as credit risk is an essential component of fair value  the firm includes a credit valuation adjustment cva in the fair value of derivatives to reflect counterparty credit risk  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this form k 
cva is a function of the present value of expected exposure  the probability of counterparty default and the assumed recovery upon default 

table of contents the tables below present the distribution of our exposure to otc derivatives by tenor  based on expected duration for mortgage related credit derivatives and generally on remaining contractual maturity for other derivatives  both before and after the effect of collateral and netting agreements 
the categories shown reflect our internally determined public rating agency equivalents 
in millions as of december years exposure or net of credit rating equivalent months years greater total netting exposure collateral aaa aaa aa aa a a bbb baa bb ba or lower unrated total in millions as of december years exposure or net of credit rating equivalent months years greater total netting exposure collateral aaa aaa aa aa a a bbb baa bb ba or lower unrated total represents the netting of receivable balances with payable balances for the same counterparty across tenor categories under enforceable netting agreements  and the netting of cash collateral received under credit support agreements 
receivable and payable balances with the same counterparty in the same tenor category are netted within such tenor category 

table of contents lending activities 
we manage the firm s traditional credit origination activities  including funded loans  lending commitments and the william street credit extension program  using the credit risk process  measures and limits described above 
other lending positions  including secondary trading positions  are risk managed as a component of market risk 
resale agreements and securities borrowed 
the firm bears credit risk related to resale agreements and securities borrowed only to the extent that cash advanced to the counterparty exceeds the value of the collateral received 
therefore  the firm s credit exposure on these transactions is significantly lower than the amounts recorded on the consolidated statement of financial condition which represent fair value or contractual value before consideration of collateral received 
the firm also has credit exposure on repurchase agreements and securities loaned  which are liabilities on our consolidated statement of financial condition  to the extent that the value of collateral pledged to the counterparty for these transactions exceeds the amount of cash received 
other credit exposures 
the firm is exposed to credit risk from its receivables from brokers  dealers and clearing organizations and customers and counterparties 
receivables from brokers  dealers and clearing organizations are primarily comprised of initial margin placed with clearing organizations and receivables related to sales of securities which have traded  but not yet settled 
these receivables have minimal credit risk due to the low probability of clearing organization default and the short term nature of receivables related to securities settlements 
receivables from customers and counterparties are generally comprised of collateralized receivables related to customer securities transactions and have minimal credit risk due to both the value of the collateral received and the short term nature of these receivables 
credit exposures the tables below present the firm s credit exposures related to cash  otc derivatives  loans and lending commitments associated with traditional credit origination activities  and securities financing transactions  broken down by industry  region and internal credit rating 
during the year ended december  total credit exposures increased by billion reflecting an increase in loans and lending commitments 
this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in lending activity and a modest increase in average commitment size 
during the year ended december  incidence of counterparty default and the associated credit losses have declined compared with the year ended december the credit quality of the overall portfolio as of december is relatively unchanged although otc derivative exposure to non investment grade counterparties declined approximately from december

table of contents operational risk overview operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes  people and systems or from external events 
our exposure to operational risk arises from routine processing errors as well as extraordinary incidents  such as major systems failures 
potential types of loss events related to internal and external operational risk include clients  products and business practices  execution  delivery and process management  business disruption and system failures  employment practices and workplace safety  damage to physical assets  internal fraud  and external fraud 
the firm maintains a comprehensive control framework designed to provide a well controlled environment to minimize operational risks 
the firmwide operational risk committee provides oversight of the ongoing development and implementation of our operational risk policies and framework 
our operational risk management department operational risk management is a risk management function independent of our revenue producing units and is responsible for developing and implementing policies  methodologies and a formalized framework for operational risk management with the goal of minimizing our exposure to operational risk 
operational risk management managing operational risk requires timely and accurate information as well as a strong control culture 
we seek to manage our operational risk through the training  supervision and development of our people  the active participation of senior management in identifying and mitigating key operational risks across the firm  independent control and support functions that monitor operational risk on a daily basis and have instituted extensive policies and procedures and implemented controls designed to prevent the occurrence of operational risk events  proactive communication between our revenue producing units and our independent control and support functions  and a network of systems throughout the firm to facilitate the collection of data used to analyze and assess our operational risk exposure 
we combine top down and bottom up approaches to manage and measure operational risk 
from a top down perspective  the firm s senior management assesses firmwide and business level operational risk profiles 
from a bottom up perspective  revenue producing units and independent control and support functions are responsible for risk management on a day to day basis  including identifying  mitigating  and escalating operational risks to senior management 
our operational risk framework is in part designed to comply with the operational risk measurement rules under basel and has evolved based on the changing needs of our businesses and regulatory guidance 
our framework includes the following practices risk identification and reporting  risk measurement  and risk monitoring 
internal audit performs a review of our operational risk framework  including our key controls  processes and applications  on an annual basis to ensure the effectiveness of our framework 
risk identification and reporting the core of our operational risk management framework is risk identification and reporting 
we have a comprehensive data collection process  including firmwide policies and procedures  for operational risk events 
we have established policies that require managers in our revenue producing units and our independent control and support functions to escalate operational risk events 
when operational risk events are identified  our policies require that the events be documented and analyzed to determine whether changes are required in the firm s systems and or processes to further mitigate the risk of future events 
in addition  our firmwide systems capture internal operational risk event data  key metrics such as transaction volumes  and statistical information such as performance trends 
we use an internally developed operational risk management application to aggregate and organize this information 
managers from both revenue producing units and independent control and support functions analyze the information to evaluate operational risk exposures and identify businesses  activities or products with heightened levels of operational risk 
we also provide operational risk reports to senior management  risk committees and the board periodically 

table of contents risk measurement we measure the firm s operational risk exposure over a twelve month time horizon using scenario analyses  together with qualitative assessments of the potential frequency and extent of potential operational risk losses  for each of the firm s businesses 
operational risk measurement incorporates qualitative and quantitative assessments of factors including internal and external operational risk event data  assessments of the firm s internal controls  evaluations of the complexity of the firm s business activities  the degree of and potential for automation in the firm s processes  new product information  the legal and regulatory environment  changes in the markets for the firm s products and services  including the diversity and sophistication of the firm s customers and counterparties  and the liquidity of the capital markets and the reliability of the infrastructure that supports the capital markets 
the results from these scenario analyses are used to monitor changes in operational risk and to determine business lines that may have heightened exposure to operational risk 
these analyses ultimately are used to determine the appropriate level of operational risk capital to hold 
risk monitoring we evaluate changes in the operational risk profile of the firm and its businesses  including changes in business mix or jurisdictions in which the firm operates  by monitoring these factors at a firmwide  entity and business level 
the firm has both detective and preventive internal controls  which are designed to reduce the frequency and severity of operational risk losses and the probability of operational risk events 
we monitor the results of assessments and independent internal audits of these internal controls
