item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general this discussion is intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the company 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes contained in this report 
critical accounting policies the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in future periods 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
please see those policies in conjunction with this discussion 
management believes that the following policies would be considered critical under the sec s definition allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is the company s estimate of probable credit losses that are inherent in the loan portfolio at the financial statement date 
management uses historical information  as well as current economic data  to assess the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses as it is affected by changing economic conditions and various external factors  which may impact the portfolio in ways currently unforeseen 
although we believe that we use appropriate available information to establish the allowance for loan losses  future additions to the allowance may be necessary if certain future events occur that cause actual results to differ from the assumptions used in making the evaluation 
conditions in the local economy and real estate values could require us to increase our provisions for loan losses  which would negatively impact earnings 
income taxes 
the company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in which deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the company s asset and liabilities 
the realization of the net deferred tax asset generally depends upon future levels of taxable income and the existence of prior years taxable income  to which carry back refund claims could be made 
a valuation allowance is maintained for deferred tax assets that management estimates are more likely than not to be unrealizable based on available evidence at the time the estimate is made 
significant management judgment is required in determining income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities 
in determining the valuation allowance  the company uses historical and forecasted future operating results  based upon approved business plans  including a review of the eligible carryforward periods  tax planning opportunities and other relevant considerations 
these underlying assumptions can change from period to period 
for example  tax law changes or variances in future projected operating performance could result in a change in the valuation allowance 
should actual factors and conditions differ materially from those considered by management  the actual realization of the net deferred tax asset could differ materially from the amounts recorded in the financial statements 
if the company is not able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be charged to income tax expense in the period such determination was made 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets are recorded as a result of business acquisitions and combinations 
these assets are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 
if the carrying amount exceeds fair value  an impairment charge is recorded to income 
the fair value is based on observable market prices  when practicable 
other valuation techniques may be used when market prices are unavailable  including estimated discounted cash flows and market multiples analyses 
these types of analyses contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies 
in the event of future changes in fair value  the company may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material 
determination of other than temporary impairment of securities 
the company evaluates debt and equity securities within the company s available for sale and held to maturity portfolios for other than temporary impairment otti  at least quarterly 
if the fair value of a debt security is below the amortized cost basis of the security  otti is required to be recognized if any of the following are met the company intends to sell the security  it is more likely than not that the company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis  or for debt securities  the present value of expected cash flows is not sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis 
for all impaired debt securities that the company intends to sell  or more likely than not will be required to sell  the full amount of the depreciation is recognized as otti through earnings 
credit related otti for all other impaired debt securities is recognized through earnings 
non credit related otti for such debt securities is recognized in other comprehensive income  net of applicable taxes 
in evaluating its marketable equity securities portfolios for otti  the company considers its intent and ability to hold an equity security to recovery of its cost basis in addition to various other factors  including the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost and the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer 
any otti on marketable equity securities is recognized immediately through earnings 
should actual factors and conditions differ materially from those expected by management  the actual realization of gains or losses on investment securities could differ materially from the amounts recorded in the financial statements 
fair value of financial instruments 
the company uses fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain financial instruments and to determine fair value disclosures 
trading assets  securities available for sale  and derivative instruments are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis 
additionally  from time to time  the company may be required to record at fair value other assets on a nonrecurring basis  or to establish a loss allowance or write down based on the fair value of impaired assets 
further  the notes to financial statements include information about the extent to which fair value is used to measure assets and liabilities  the valuation methodologies used and its impact to earnings 
additionally  for financial instruments not recorded at fair value  the notes to financial statements disclose the estimate of their fair value 
due to the judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimation process  the estimates could result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions

during the year  the pool trust secured security was downgraded from caa and the unrealized loss increased to of book value from at year end this security is performing 
the company evaluated the security  with a level fair value of million  for potential otti at year end and determined that other than temporary impairment was not evident based on both the company s more likely than not ability to hold the security until the recovery of its remaining amortized cost and the protection from credit loss afforded by million in excess subordination above current and projected losses 
the company s analysis included a break even analysis with the assistance of an independent third party valuation specialist to calculate the excess subordination of the mezzanine class b tranche

the total amount of loans with such floors was about million at year end the average balance of loans increased by in as a result of accelerated growth in the second half of and loan charge offs recorded at the end of as a result  the earnings benefit from higher second half loan growth will provide additional momentum to interest income growth in asset quality

loan loss allowance 
the determination of the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting estimate 
the company s methodologies for determining the loan loss allowance are discussed in item i of this report

the specific valuation allowance assigned to impaired loans decreased to million from million during total loans deemed impaired decreased to million from million as a result of the problem asset resolution strategies discussed earlier

the new york growth reflected ongoing deposit growth related to the bank s de novo branches opened in recent years in this strategically important region 
the bank opened an additional two branches in this region late in new york deposit growth also benefited from commercial balance growth developed by the commercial banking team that joined the region in the company achieved low single digit deposit growth in all of its other regions  reflecting ongoing business development 
the deposit growth resulted from growth of non maturity deposits which was partially offset by a decrease in time deposits 
the decrease in time deposits reflected shifting consumer preferences to more liquid balances in light of the continuing low interest rate environment and the run off of higher yielding maturing time account balances 
the increase in non maturity deposits included a million increase in retail balances and an million increase in commercial balances 
all categories of non maturity deposits increased  with most of the growth concentrated in a million increase in money market deposits which the company promoted throughout the year as an alternative to time deposits and as a vehicle to other relationship product sales 
transaction account balances increased by in  and the company continues to promote demand deposit and now accounts as core components to the total banking relationship 
demand deposit growth of included a increase in the number of accounts and a increase in balances  reflecting higher liquidity held by customers in these accounts

the average cost of fdic insurance expense measured approximately of average deposits in under new premium rules  fdic insurance expense will be based on total assets rather than total deposits  and will include higher assessment rates for banks over billion 
the fdic expects that most institutions under billion will pay lower assessments as a result of these new rules 
borrowings and debentures 
total borrowings and debentures decreased by million to million in  as excess liquidity from deposit growth was used to pay down short term borrowings from the federal home loan bank 
the company purchased million in forward starting interest rate swaps on fhlbb borrowings in which will have the effect of extending protection from rising rates in future years 
additionally  in the third quarter  the company terminated million of cash flow hedges against fhlbb borrowings maturing in years based on a determination that this level of protection against rising interest rates was not necessary given the company s continuing asset sensitive interest rate risk profile 
the average cost of borrowings decreased from in the fourth quarter of to in the first quarter of due to the borrowings prepayments made at the end of the cost of borrowings further declined to in the fourth quarter of including the benefit of the hedging changes discussed above 
derivative financial instruments 
the company has relationships with several national banks which are counterparties for its interest rate swaps 
at year end  the company had million in total notional value of interest rate swaps with commercial loan customers  which were offset with back to back swaps with bank counterparties 
this was a increase over the million notional value of these swaps at the start of the year 
the company also had million in total notional value of interest rate swaps with bank counterparties which were hedging borrowings and debentures  and million hedging the tax advantaged economic development bond designated as a trading security 
these totals were unchanged from the start of the year  although the component swaps were changed as discussed in the borrowings discussion 
the effect of these changes was to shorten the overall maturity of borrowings hedges and to reduce the current and future period payments contracted under the swaps 
the million loss on the million in terminated cash flow hedges remained in accumulated other comprehensive income and will be amortized into earnings in the same periods during which the originally hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings 
this amortization is expected to be more than offset by the lower interest cost on the related borrowings 
the net fair value of derivative financial instruments was estimated at a net loss of million at year end  which was slightly more than the loss estimated at the prior year end 
this unrealized estimated loss is primarily due to the impact of the unanticipated ongoing low interest rate environment on the value of the swaps on borrowings which were intended to fix the rates on variable rate borrowings 
the increase in other liabilities was primarily due to an increase in the gross derivatives liability to million at year end from million at the start of the year and resulted from the higher liability on fixed rate swaps sold to commercial customers  this liability is offset by a similar asset on the offsetting back to back swaps  with little impact on the million net derivatives liability discussed above

based on the year end closing stock price of and year end outstanding shares totaling million  the company s market capitalization at that date was million  which was an increase over million at the start of the year 
total stockholders equity increased slightly to million from million in as the increase in retained earnings was partially offset by an increase in the accumulated other comprehensive loss primarily related to derivative instruments 
the company paid dividends totaling million  or of the million in net income 
the per share dividend in provided a yield based on the average closing price of the company s common stock in equity also increased by million as a result of stock based compensation relating to grants of restricted stock totaling  shares  including  performance based shares  with vesting scheduled over a year period 
additionally  equity increased by million due to proceeds received from the exercise of stock options during the year 
at year end  the bank s regulatory capital ratios exceeded the requirements to be considered well capitalized  with the total risk based capital ratio measuring 
the bank is regulated by the fdic and berkshire hills bancorp is regulated by the ots  which does not establish required holding company capital ratios similar to those of the other bank regulatory agencies 
based on federal regulatory changes  the ots is being merged into another federal agency  and the regulation and supervision of berkshire hills bancorp will become the responsibility of the federal reserve bank of boston  beginning in the third quarter of the boston federal reserve bank already supervises the majority of bank holding companies located in new england 
the federal reserve bank requires capital ratios and capital standards for consolidated holding companies  which are similar in many respects to those required by the fdic for regulated banks 
the company does not expect that there will be any material impact on its business as a result of this holding company regulatory change

the company strives to maintain a modestly asset sensitive interest rate risk profile so that long term earnings will benefit when interest rates increase from the very low levels that have existed in the most recent years 
at the start of  the company s interest rate model indicated that the margin would be under further pressure if interest rates did not increase in the company undertook various initiatives previously described to offset this margin pressure and to increase the net interest margin towards its long term goal of 
at year end  the model continued to indicate the potential for gradual margin pressure until interest rates increase 
the company continues to pursue strategies intended to avoid a reduction in the net interest margin and expects that the net interest margin will improve as a result of the completion of the pending merger agreements with rome and legacy

fair value measurements 
the company records fair value measurements of certain assets and liabilities  as described in the related note in the financial statements 
recurring fair values of financial instruments primarily relate to securities and derivative instruments 
a valuation hierarchy is utilized based on generally accepted accounting principles 
measurements based on level inputs rely the most on subjective management judgments 
level recurring measurements relate primarily to the million fair value of a local tax advantaged economic development bond issued to a berkshire county non profit  which is classified as a trading security 
changes in the fair value of this security are recorded in non interest income  as are offsetting changes in the accompanying interest rate swap 
additionally  a pooled trust preferred security and two limited partnership securities are valued on this basis 
non recurring fair values of financial instruments relate primarily to impairment analysis of economic development bonds recorded as held to maturity  restricted equity securities  and loans 
the only assets deemed impaired were million in loans  which were evaluated based on level inputs  which gave rise to a million impairment reserve at year end fair value measurements of non financial assets and liabilities primarily relate to impairment analyses of intangibles and goodwill 
the company performed an impairment analysis of its goodwill in the most recent quarter  and determined that there was no impairment at year end the company also provides a summary of estimated fair values of financial instruments at each quarter end 
the category of financial assets with the most significant difference between carrying value and fair value is the net loan category 
the fair value of loans is estimated to be at a million discount to carrying value at year end  compared to a million discount to carrying value at year end this improvement reflected the improved credit profile of the loan portfolio in  along with the impact of lower medium term rates and market pricing spreads for loans 
for financial liabilities  the total fair value of deposits  borrowings  and debentures is estimated to be million higher than carrying value at year end  which is not significantly changed from million at the start of the year 
the improvement in the unrealized loss on these liabilities was primarily due to an improvement in deposits related to the runoff of higher costing time deposits during the year 
the combined million improvement in the unrealized loss on the above loans and liabilities reflected an overall improvement in the economic value of equity related to these instruments 
impact of inflation and changing price the financial statements and related financial data presented in this form k have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike many industrial companies  substantially all of the assets and liabilities of the bank are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on the bank s performance than the general level of inflation 
interest rates may be affected by inflation  but the direction and magnitude of the impact may vary 
a sudden change in inflation or expectations about inflation  with a related change in interest rates  would have a significant impact on our operations 
impact of new accounting pronouncements please refer to the note on recent accounting pronouncements in note to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of new accounting pronouncements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management of interest rate risk and market risk analysis qualitative aspects of market risk 
the company s most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk 
the comany seeks to avoid fluctuations in its net interest income and to maximize net interest income within acceptable levels of risk through periods of changing interest rates 
the company maintains an asset liability committee that is responsible for reviewing its asset liability policies and interest rate risk position 
this committee meets monthly and reports trends and interest rate risk position to the risk management committee and board of directors on a quarterly basis 
the extent of the movement of interest rates is an uncertainty that could have a negative impact on the company s earnings 
the company has managed interest rate risk by emphasizing assets with shorter term repricing durations  periodically selling long term fixed rate assets  promoting low cost core deposits  and using fhlbb advances to structure its liability repricing durations 
the company also uses interest rate swaps in order to enhance its interest rate risk position and manage its balance sheet 
quantitative aspects of market risk 
the company uses a simulation model to measure the potential change in net interest income that would result from both an instantaneous or ramped change in market interest rates assuming a parallel shift along the entire yield curve 
the chart below shows the analysis of a ramped change 
loans  deposits and borrowings were expected to reprice at the repricing or maturity date 
the company uses prepayment guidelines set forth by market sources as well as company generated data where applicable 
cash flows from loans and securities are assumed to be reinvested based on current operating conditions and strategies 
other assumptions about balance sheet mix are generally held constant 
no material changes have been made to the methodologies used in the model 
change in interest rates basis months months points rate ramp change change change change in thousands at december  at december  during  the company maintained its moderately asset sensitive interest rate risk profile 
this reflects the company s general preference and also reflects management s expectations that inflation and interest rates will rise from recent low levels 
one factor contributing to this profile included the bank s new asset based lending program which began in nearly all of the loans in this program have rate reset frequencies of one month or less 
additionally  the company continues to offer back to back interest rate swaps to certain commercial borrowers  and thereby was able to originate adjustable rate commercial loans which the customers swapped into fixed interest rates 
back to back interest rate swaps totaled million at year end and allowed the bank to fund these loans with short term deposits  including money market accounts which help the company grow its core transaction based customer deposit franchise 
due to the limitations and uncertainties relating to model assumptions  the above computations should not be relied on as projections of income 
further  the computations do not reflect any actions that management may undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
the most significant assumption relates to expectations for the interest sensitivity of non maturity deposit accounts in a rising rate environment 
the model assumes that deposit rate sensitivity will be a percentage of the market interest rate change 
the rate sensitivity depends on the underlying amount of market rate change and the type of deposit account 
the percentage rate movements are as follows now accounts ranging between and  money market accounts ranging between and  and savings accounts ranging between and 
one of the significant limitations of the simulation is that it assumes parallel shifts in the yield curve 
actual interest rate risks are often more complex than this scenario 
assumption changes in were based on a review of past performance and future expectations and were not viewed as material
