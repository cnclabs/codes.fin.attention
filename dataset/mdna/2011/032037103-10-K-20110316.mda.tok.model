item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in thousands  except per share amounts executive overview ampco pittsburgh corporation operates in two business segments the forged and cast rolls segment and the air and liquid processing segment 
the forged and cast rolls segment consists of union electric steel corporation union electric steel or ues and union electric steel uk limited  formerly known as the davy roll company limited ues uk 
union electric steel is one of the world s largest manufacturers of forged hardened steel rolls with principal operations in pennsylvania and indiana whereas ues uk produces cast iron and steel rolls in england 
rolls are supplied to manufacturers of steel and aluminum throughout the world 
the air and liquid processing segment includes aerofin  buffalo air handling and buffalo pumps  all divisions of air liquid systems corporation 
aerofin produces highly engineered heat exchange coils for a variety of users including electric utility  hvac  power generation  industrial process and other manufacturing industries 
buffalo air handling makes custom designed air handling systems for commercial  institutional and industrial building markets 
buffalo pumps manufactures centrifugal pumps for the defense  refrigeration and power generation industries 
the segment has operations in virginia and new york with headquarters in pennsylvania 
the segment distributes a significant portion of its products through a common independent group of sales offices located throughout the us and canada 
in  the forged and cast rolls group achieved strong earnings in a recovering global metals industry 
aided by a robust government stimulus in the western world and the continued need for steel products by developing countries  particularly china and india  demand for roll products was significantly better than in the group also benefited from long term supply agreements in place with its major steel and aluminum producers who  in turn  placed a higher than normal percentage of business with the forged and cast rolls group to meet its contractual requirements 
all of these events resulted in improved operating levels compared to there are signs that excessive inventories of rolling mill rolls throughout the world are being reduced as production begins to return to pre levels 
expectations for are for a modest increase in roll consumption and  for us  a gradual improvement in production levels 
additionally  we expect to continue to benefit from a weak us dollar and british pound  however  pricing pressures from our customers will likely remain 
in  results of the air and liquid processing segment were impacted by a pre tax charge of  for the increase in estimated settlement and defense costs of pending and future asbestos claims  net of estimated insurance recoveries 
the claims result from alleged personal injury from exposure to asbestos containing components historically used in some products manufactured decades ago by certain former subsidiary companies now operated as divisions within the air and liquid processing group 
with the help of experts in asbestos liability valuation and insurance recovery modeling  we determined that litigation costs net of insurance recoveries could be reasonably estimated through causing the additional charge see note to consolidated financial statements 
notwithstanding the asbestos charge of  the air and liquid processing segment had disappointing operating results when compared to the backlog at the beginning of was well below the prior year which forced the segment to rely on quick turn business which in many cases was at lower margins 
the power generation and new construction spending by the institutional markets has yet to exhibit any significant signs of a recovery 
the focus for these companies is to continue to search for new product lines and to strengthen their sales distribution networks 
operating results for the corporation for are expected to be comparable to those of  excluding the additional asbestos charge 
additionally  we are financially liquid with over  in cash and cash equivalents as of december  ampco pittsburgh annual report consolidated results of operations overview the corporation net sales forged and cast rolls air and liquid processing consolidated income loss from operations forged and cast rolls air and liquid processing corporate costs consolidated backlog forged and cast rolls air and liquid processing consolidated income loss from operations for the air and liquid processing segment includes a provision for asbestos related costs of  and  for and  respectively  see note to consolidated financial statements 
after being adversely impacted by the global economic downturn beginning in the fourth quarter of  consolidated net sales began to rebound during the current year due to improved demand for forged and cast rolls 
notwithstanding the additional asbestos charge of  and  for and  respectively  consolidated income from operations for decreased when compared to the earlier years principally due to higher costs for raw materials 
a more detailed synopsis by segment is included below 
the increase in corporate costs over the previous years is primarily attributable to stock based compensation and higher pension related costs and professional fees 
gross margin  excluding depreciation  as a percentage of net sales was  and for  and  respectively 
the improvement in is primarily attributable to lower raw material costs and reduced labor charges related to decreases in employment and temporary layoffs 
raw material costs increased in the current year and  for the forged and cast rolls group  manning levels began to return to more historical levels 
selling and administrative expenses totaled  of net sales   of net sales and  of net sales for  and  respectively 
the increase in from is primarily attributable to escalating pension related expenses  stock based compensation associated with a grant of stock options  and higher commissions and freight costs attributable to higher sales 
while pension related expenses and stock based compensation costs for increased over amounts  the effect was more than offset by lower commissions and freight costs 
depreciation expense increased in as a result of the completion of a significant portion of our capital investment program for the forged and cast rolls group including the installation of a forged press and manipulator at one of its domestic operations 
the goodwill impairment charge in represents the write off of goodwill associated with one of the divisions of the air and liquid processing segment 
we do not have any other material intangible assets 
the charge for asbestos litigation in represents an extension of the estimated costs of pending and future asbestos claims  net of additional insurance recoveries  to the end of the charge for asbestos litigation in represented an extension of the estimated costs of pending and future asbestos claims  net of additional insurance recoveries  from through the end of the claims result from alleged personal injury from exposure to asbestos containing components historically used in some products manufactured decades ago by certain of our former subsidiary companies now operated as divisions within the air and liquid processing group see note to consolidated financial statements 
investment related income increased in when compared to due to higher dividends from our chinese cast roll joint venture company which approximated  and in  and  respectively 
investment related income decreased in against due to lower average interest rates during the year 
ampco pittsburgh annual report interest expense for and decreased from as a result of lower interest rates on our variable rate industrial revenue bonds 
other expense income fluctuated primarily as a result of foreign exchange gains in versus foreign exchange losses in and additionally  provisions were made in and of and  respectively  for environmental costs estimated to be incurred relating to the remediation of real estate previously owned whereas benefited from a reduction in an accrual for environmental remediation for unrelated locations which were previously sold 
our statutory income tax rate equals which compares to an effective income tax rate of  and for  and  respectively 
for  although the effective income tax rate was favorably impacted by beneficial permanent differences for our domestic operations and reversal of a valuation allowance previously provided against deferred income tax assets associated with foreign tax credit carryforwards  tax consequences related to certain foreign sourced income and changes in state income tax rates offset the expected improvement 
for  the income tax provision includes an additional charge to recognize a reduction in the effective state income tax rate for which certain net deferred income tax assets will be realized 
for  beneficial permanent differences for our domestic operations favorably impacted the effective income tax rate 
in addition  for  the effective income tax rate was reduced by the reversal of a valuation allowance previously provided against deferred income tax assets associated with capital loss carryforwards 
equity losses in chinese joint venture represent union electric steel s share of the losses of ues mg see note to consolidated financial statements 
since production by the joint venture is in its early stages  operating results have been insignificant 
as a result of the above  we earned  or per common share for   or per common share for and  or per common share for net income for includes an after tax charge of  or per common share for estimated costs of asbestos related litigation through net income for includes an after tax charge of  or per common share for the write off of goodwill associated with one of the divisions of the air and liquid processing segment and adjustment of net deferred income tax assets to their realizable amount 
net income for includes an after tax charge of  or per common share for estimated costs of asbestos related litigation through offset by the release of tax related valuation allowances associated with capital loss carryforwards 
forged and cast rolls net sales operating income backlog net sales for the current year improved from the prior year due to an increase in the volume of shipments  particularly to our international customers 
the expected contribution to operating income from the additional sales was offset by lower revenues from the variable index surcharge program and higher costs for direct and indirect materials and fuels 
additionally  as sales and production returned to more normal levels during  commissions and employee related costs increased and  with the completion of a significant portion of its capital investment program  depreciation expense was higher 
pension related expenses also continued to increase 
net sales for declined when compared to primarily due to the weak economy and worldwide recession resulting in a lower consumption of rolling mill rolls and the deferral of orders by customers  particularly for the cast roll business in england 
by comparison  the global steel and aluminum industries were operating at or near capacity in additionally  in  revenues from the variable index surcharge program were less than that in while reduced shipment levels negatively impacted operating income  the effect was minimized from lower raw material costs  lower employee related costs resulting from temporary layoffs and reductions in manning  and a decrease in commission expense and freight costs 
deterioration in the weighted average exchange rates used to translate sales and operating income of ues uk from the british pound to the us dollar also reduced sales and operating income for when compared to by  and  respectively 
with respect to the variable index surcharge  a majority of customer orders include a provision allowing the selling price to be increased or decreased  as applicable  for corresponding changes in the published index cost of certain raw materials eg  steel scrap and ferroalloys utilized in the manufacturing process 
while this variable index surcharge program helps to protect us and our customers against unpredictable changes in the cost of commodities used in the manufacturing process against the base cost of commodities used to establish selling prices at the time of order placement  there is a lag in timing of approximately six months between the recognition of these changes in our costs of products sold and in our revenues 
ampco pittsburgh annual report the ongoing decline in backlog from the previous periods is a result of shipments outpacing new orders 
historically  the norm for the level of backlog was to months 
however  the surge in global steel production coupled with the then existing shortage of supply caused customers to place orders for rolling mill rolls out several years 
the resultant high level of backlog at the end has been declining and becoming more in line with our historical pattern 
as of december   approximately  of the backlog is expected to be released after in addition  we have commitments of roughly  from customers under long term supply arrangements which will be included in backlog upon receipt of specific purchase orders closer to the requirement dates for delivery 
air and liquid processing income loss from operations for and includes a charge for asbestos litigation of  and  respectively  relating to claims resulting from alleged personal injury from exposure to asbestos containing equipment manufactured decades ago see note to consolidated financial statements 
in addition  uninsured legal and case management and valuation costs associated with asbestos litigation approximated  and in  and  respectively 
in  due to uncertainties in the industry  including when business activity would return to historical levels  and excess capacity in the market place  we determined that the goodwill associated with one of the divisions of this segment was impaired and recorded a pre tax charge of  net sales operating loss income backlog notwithstanding the additional charge for asbestos litigation in and  sales and operating income for the segment for the current year decreased when compared to the two prior years 
the lack of new construction spending has adversely impacted all three divisions 
with respect to buffalo pumps  sales and operating income for were less than due to a reduction in the volume of business activity particularly from power generation customers and us navy shipbuilders 
the expected impact to operating income was minimized as a result of improved margins 
while sales for were less than sales for  operating income was comparable due to better margins and lower raw material costs 
regarding aerofin  sales and operating income for the current year were less than each of the prior years attributable to a reduced volume of shipments  particularly to customers in the utility industry 
additionally  operating income for benefited from a shift in product mix with higher portion of shipments to electric utility customers offset by a reduction in lower margin sales to original equipment manufacturers 
for buffalo air handling  sales and operating results for were less than that for and due to lower business activity 
construction projects for pharmaceutical companies and universities continue to be adversely impacted by the weak economy and lack of funding 
the improvement in backlog at december  against is principally attributable to buffalo air handling due to receipt of one large order for a customer in the medical industry and buffalo pumps due to additional orders for the us navy 
when compared to december   backlog for buffalo pumps and aerofin has been affected by conservative spending from its customers due to the weak economy and in anticipation of future energy policies by the us government 
the majority of the year end backlog is currently scheduled to ship in liquidity and capital resources net cash flows provided by operating activities for equaled  compared to  and  for and  respectively 
while the charges for asbestos litigation recorded in and reduced earnings  they did not impact cash flows for those years by those amounts 
instead  the asbestos liability  net of insurance recoveries  will be paid over a number of years and will be subject to tax benefits 
net asbestos related payments equaled   and  in  and  respectively  and are expected to approximate  in also  the goodwill impairment charge recorded in does not impact net cash flows provided by operating activities 
contributions to our pension and other postretirement plans approximated  in of which  were voluntary contributions   in of which  were voluntary contributions and  in of which  were voluntary contributions 
while required minimum contributions to our pension and other postretirement plans are expected to approximate  in  further voluntarily contributions may be made 
additionally  the estimated minimum contribution to the us pension plan in may have been higher if voluntary contributions would not have been made to the plan 
accounts receivable increased as of december  when compared to as a result of stronger fourth quarter sales 
by comparison  accounts receivable decreased at the end of against due to weaker fourth quarter to fourth quarter sales 
the increase in inventories at december  and against december  is principally associated with higher levels of raw materials particularly steel scrap  ferroalloys and other commodities associated with improved business ampco pittsburgh annual report activity 
the increase in accounts payable at year end against year end is attributable to timing of payments and outstanding amounts relating to purchases of equipment 
net cash flows used in investing activities were   and  in  and  respectively  the majority of which represents expenditures relating to the capital investment program for the forged and cast rolls group 
in  ues uk was awarded a governmental grant of up to  toward the purchase and installation of certain machinery and equipment of which was received during the year 
as of december   anticipated future capital expenditures are expected to approximate  the majority of which will be spent in during  union electric steel made its final contribution to the chinese joint venture 
additionally  in  monies were deposited in escrow and are being held as collateral for the outstanding foreign currency sales contracts of ues uk 
a portion of these monies were returned in and in connection with diminishing exposure and no further deposits have been required to date 
net cash outflows from financing activities represent primarily the payment of dividends of per common share during each of the years 
during and  stock options were exercised resulting in proceeds from the issuance of common stock and excess tax benefits 
no options were exercised during the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents is primarily attributable to the fluctuation of the british pound against the us dollar 
as a result of the above  cash and cash equivalents increased by  in and ended the year at  in comparison to  and  at december  and  respectively 
funds on hand and funds generated from future operations are expected to be sufficient to finance the operational and capital expenditure requirements 
we also maintain short term lines of credit in excess of the cash needs of our businesses 
the total available at december  was approximately  including  in the uk and in belgium 
we had the following contractual obligations outstanding as of december  payments due by period total years other industrial revenue bond debt operating lease obligations capital expenditures pension and other postretirement benefit obligations purchase obligations unrecognized tax benefits total amount represents principal only 
interest is not included since it is variable  interest rates averaged less than in the current year 
the industrial revenue bonds begin to mature in  however  if the bonds are unable to be remarketed they will be refinanced under a separate facility 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
represents estimated contributions to our pension and other postretirement plans 
actual required contributions are contingent on a number of variables including future investment performance of the plans assets and may differ from these estimates 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
contributions to the us defined benefit plan are based on the projected funded status of the plan including anticipated normal costs  amortization of unfunded liabilities and an expected return on plan assets 
with respect to the uk defined benefit plan  the trustees and ues uk have agreed to a recovery plan that estimates the amount of employer contributions  based on uk regulations  necessary to eliminate the funding deficit of the plan over an agreed period 
represents primarily commitments by one of our forged and cast rolls subsidiaries for the purchase of natural gas through covering approximately of anticipated needs to meet orders in backlog 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
represents uncertain tax positions 
amount included as other represents portion for which the period of cash settlement cannot be reasonably estimated 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
with respect to environmental matters  we are currently performing certain remedial actions in connection with the sale of real estate previously owned and have been named a potentially responsible party at two third party landfill sites 
in addition  as a result of a sale of a segment  we retained the liability to remediate certain environmental contamination and have agreed to indemnify the buyer against third party claims arising from the discharge of certain contamination  the cost for which was accrued at the time of sale 
environmental exposures are difficult to assess and estimate for numerous reasons including lack of reliable data  the multiplicity of possible solutions  the years of remedial and monitoring activity required and the identification of new sites 
however  we believe the potential liability for all environmental proceedings of approximately  accrued at december  is considered adequate based on information known to date see note to consolidated financial statements 
ampco pittsburgh annual report the nature and scope of our business brings us into regular contact with a variety of persons  businesses and government agencies in the ordinary course of business 
consequently  we  our subsidiaries and our divisions from time to time are named in various legal actions 
generally  we do not anticipate that our financial condition or liquidity will be materially affected by the costs of known  pending or threatened litigation 
however  we  our subsidiaries and our divisions are involved in multiple claims for alleged personal injury from exposure to asbestos containing components used in certain products and there can be no assurance that future claims will not present significantly greater and longer lasting financial exposure than presently contemplated see note to consolidated financial statements 
effects of inflation while inflationary and market pressures on costs are likely to be experienced in  it is anticipated that price adjustments  ongoing improvements in manufacturing efficiencies and cost savings efforts will mitigate the effects of inflation on operating results 
product pricing for the forged and cast rolls segment is reflective of current costs with a majority of orders subject to a variable index surcharge program which helps to protect the segment and its customers against the volatility in the cost of certain raw materials 
additionally  long term labor agreements exist at each of the key locations and commitments have been executed for natural gas usage to cover a significant portion of orders in the backlog 
application of critical accounting policies we have identified critical accounting policies that are important to the presentation of our financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations and involve the most complex or subjective assessments 
critical accounting policies relate to accounting for pension and other postretirement benefits  assessing recoverability of long lived assets  litigation  environmental matters  income taxes and stock based compensation 
accounting for pension and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the time period each employee works 
to accomplish this  input from our actuary is evaluated and extensive use is made of assumptions about inflation  long term rate of return on plan assets  mortality  rates of increases in compensation  employee turnover and discount rates 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is an estimate of average rates of earnings expected to be earned on funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation 
since these benefits will be paid over many years  the expected long term rate of return is reflective of current investment returns and investment returns over a longer period 
also  consideration is given to target and actual asset allocations  inflation and real risk free return 
we believe the expected long term rate of return of for our domestic plan and for our foreign plan to be reasonable 
actual returns on plan assets for and  respectively  approximated and for our domestic plan and and for our foreign plan 
the discount rates used in determining future pension obligations and other postretirement benefits for each of our plans are based on rates of return on high quality fixed income investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension and other postretirement benefits 
high quality fixed income investments are defined as those investments which have received one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency with maturities of years 
we believe the assumed discount rates of and as of december  for our domestic and uk plans  respectively  to be reasonable 
we believe that the amounts recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are based on appropriate assumptions although actual outcomes could differ 
a percentage point decrease in the expected long term rate of return would increase annual pension expense by approximately  a percentage point decrease in the discount rate would increase projected and accumulated benefit obligations by approximately  conversely  an increase in the expected long term rate of return would decrease annual pension expense and an increase in the discount rate would decrease projected and accumulated benefit obligations see note to consolidated financial statements 
property  plant and equipment are reviewed for recoverability whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the long lived assets may not be recoverable 
if the undiscounted cash flows generated from the use and eventual disposition of the assets are less than their carrying value  then the asset value may not be fully recoverable potentially resulting in a write down of the asset value 
estimates of future cash flows are based on expected market conditions over the remaining useful life of the primary asset s 
accordingly  assumptions are made about pricing  volume and asset resale values 
actual results may differ from these assumptions 
we believe the amounts recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for property  plant and equipment are recoverable and are not impaired as of december  ampco pittsburgh annual report litigation and loss contingency accruals are made when it is determined that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
specifically  we and certain of our subsidiaries and divisions are involved in various claims and lawsuits incidental to their businesses 
in addition  claims have been asserted alleging asbestos liability and alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos containing components historically used in some products of an inactive subsidiary in dissolution and a former division of the corporation 
other than an accrual for certain deductible features of relevant insurance policies  prior to  we had not accrued for settlement or defense costs for pending asbestos liability claims or asbestos liability claims that may be asserted in the future since we did not have sufficient information to make a reasonable estimate 
to assist us in determining whether an estimate could be made of the potential liability for pending and unasserted future claims for asbestos liability along with applicable insurance coverage  and the amounts of any estimates  we hired nationally recognized asbestos liability experts and insurance consultants 
the experts were not requested to estimate asbestos claims against the inactive subsidiary in dissolution or the former division  which we believe are immaterial 
based on their analyses  in and  we established reserves for the probable and reasonably estimable costs of asbestos liabilities  including defense costs  through and  respectively  and also established receivables for the insurance recoveries that were deemed probable 
these amounts relied on assumptions which were based on currently known facts and strategy 
in  we undertook another review of our asbestos liability claims  defense costs and the likelihood for insurance recoveries and determined that litigation costs net of insurance recoveries could be reasonably estimated through december causing an additional provision of  actual expenses or insurance recoveries could be significantly higher or lower than those recorded if assumptions used in the calculations vary significantly from actual results 
key variables in these assumptions are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements and include the number and type of new claims to be filed each year  the average cost of disposing of each new claim  average annual defense costs  the resolution of coverage issues with insurance carriers  and the solvency risk with respect to the relevant insurance carriers 
other factors that may affect our asbestos liability and ability to recover under our insurance policies include uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case  reforms that may be made by state and federal courts  and the passage of state or federal tort reform legislation 
we intend to evaluate our estimated asbestos liability and related insurance receivables as well as the underlying assumptions on a regular basis to determine whether any adjustments to the estimates are required 
due to the uncertainties surrounding asbestos litigation and insurance  these regular reviews may result in the incurrence of future charges  however  we are currently unable to estimate such future charges 
adjustments  if any  to our estimate of our recorded asbestos liability and or insurance receivables could be material to the operating results for the periods in which the adjustments to the liability or receivable are recorded  and to our liquidity and consolidated financial position 
environmental exposures are difficult to assess and estimate for numerous reasons including lack of reliable data  the multiplicity of possible solutions  the years of remedial and monitoring activity required and the identification of new sites 
we believe the potential liability for all environmental proceedings based on information known to date has been adequately reserved see note to consolidated financial statements 
accounting for income taxes includes management s evaluation of the underlying accounts  permanent and temporary differences  our tax filing positions and interpretations of existing tax law 
a valuation allowance is recorded against deferred income tax assets to reduce them to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in doing so  assumptions are made about the future profitability of our operations and the nature of that profitability 
actual results may differ from these assumptions 
if we determined we would not be able to realize all or part of the deferred income tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be established resulting in a charge to net income 
likewise  if we determined we would be able to realize deferred income tax assets in excess of the net amount recorded  we would release a portion of the existing valuation allowance resulting in an increase in net income 
as of december   we have deferred income tax assets approximating  and a valuation allowance of  we do not recognize a tax benefit in the financial statements related to a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return unless it is more likely than not that the tax authorities will sustain the tax position solely on the basis of the position s technical merits 
consideration is given primarily to legislation and statutes  legislative intent  regulations  rulings and case law as well as their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position when assessing the sustainability of the tax position 
in the event a tax position no longer meets the more likely than not criteria  we would reverse the tax benefit by recognizing a liability and recording a charge to earnings 
conversely  if we subsequently determined that a tax position meets the more likely than not criteria  we would recognize the tax benefit by reducing the liability and recording a credit to earnings 
as of december   based on information known to date  we believe the amount of unrecognized tax benefits of for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return which may be challenged by the tax authorities is adequate 
ampco pittsburgh annual report see note to consolidated financial statements 
accounting for stock based compensation is based on the fair value of the stock options on the date of grant 
the fair value is affected by our stock price and various assumptions including assumptions about the expected term of the options  volatility  dividends and the risk free interest rate 
if the fair value of granted stock options was re determined  on a date other than the date of grant  the resulting fair value would differ 
accordingly  the fair value of stock options granted to date is not indicative of the fair value of stock options to be granted in the future see note to consolidated financial statements 
recently implemented accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new guidance replacing the quantitative based risks and rewards calculation with a more qualitative approach for determining which enterprise  if any  has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity 
the new guidance also adds an additional reconsideration event for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity and ongoing assessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary 
the new guidance became effective on january  and did not affect our operating results  financial position or liquidity 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued asu  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  which addresses the accounting and revenue recognition of sales contracts with multiple products and or services when such products and or services are provided to the customer at different points in time or over different time periods 
asu requires the sales consideration to be allocated  at the inception of the arrangement  to each deliverable and or service using the relative selling price method 
asu will be effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified on or after january  and is not expected to have a significant impact on our operating results  financial position or liquidity 
forward looking statements the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements made by or on behalf of us 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and other sections of the annual report on form k as well as the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contain forward looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance 
forward looking statements are identified by the use of the words believes  expects  anticipates  estimates  projects  forecasts and other expressions that indicate future events and trends 
forward looking statements speak only as of the date on which such statements are made  are not guarantees of future performance or expectations  and involve risks and uncertainties 
for us  these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  those described under item a 
risk factors of this annual report on form k 
in addition  there may be events in the future that we are not able to predict accurately or control which may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations expressed or implied by forward looking statements 
we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statement  whether as a result of new information  events or otherwise 
ampco pittsburgh annual report item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we view our primary market risk exposures to relate to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
to manage certain foreign currency exchange exposures  our policy is to hedge a portion of our foreign currency denominated sales and receivables  primarily us sales denominated in euros and us sales denominated in us dollars and euros 
although strengthening of the us dollar could result in a lower volume of exports from the us and at reduced margins  it is expected that some exports of our foreign operation may increase and gross margins might improve 
additionally  strengthening of the british pound could result in a lower volume of exports from the uk and at reduced margins  however  it is expected that exports for our domestic operations may increase and gross margins might improve 
accordingly  a strengthening of either of the entities functional currency the us dollar and the british pound is not expected to have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements 
to reduce the effect of price changes for certain of our raw materials and energy  we enter into contracts for particular commodities copper and aluminum and purchase a portion of our energy usage in advance 
based on estimated annual purchases  a fluctuation in commodity prices including electricity  natural gas not purchased in advance  steel scrap and ferroalloys would have an impact of approximately  and  in and  respectively  with the increase between the two years partially being attributable to higher raw material costs in there is no guarantee that fluctuations in commodity prices will be limited to 
the ability to pass on increases in the price of commodities to the customer is contingent upon current market conditions with us potentially having to absorb some portion of such increase 
however  a sales price surcharge mechanism is in place with a majority of the customers of the forged and cast rolls segment which helps to protect us against such commodity price increases
