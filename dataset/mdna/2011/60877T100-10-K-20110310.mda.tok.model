item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes the identification of certain trends and other statements that may predict or anticipate future business or financial results 
there are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated 
see risk factors in item a of this annual report on form k 
business overview we are a biotechnology company specializing in the characterization and process engineering of complex molecules 
these complex molecules include proteins  polypeptides  and cell surface polysaccharides  like heparan sulfate proteoglycans  or hspgs 
this results in a diversified product portfolio and pipeline of complex generic  follow on biologic  and novel drugs derived from our proprietary  innovative technology platform which we leverage to study the structure thorough characterization of chemical components  structure process understand  design and control of manufacturing process  and structure activity understand and relate structure to biological and clinical activity of complex molecule drugs 
our complex generics and follow on biologics activities are focused on building a thorough understanding of the structure process activity of complex molecule drugs to develop generic versions of marketed products 
while we use a similar analytical and development approach across all of our programs  we tailor that approach for each specific program 
our first objective is to apply our core analytical technology to thoroughly characterize the structure of the marketed product 
by defining the chemical composition of multiple batches of the marketed product  we are able to develop an equivalence window which captures the inherent variability of the innovator manufacturing process 
using this information  we then build an extensive understanding of the structure process relationship to thoroughly understand  design and control our manufacturing process to reproducibly manufacture an equivalent version of the marketed product 
where necessary or appropriate  and as required by the us food and drug administration  or fda  we will provide regulators with additional supportive structure activity data eg  immunogenicity  pharmacodynamics 
our goal is to obtain fda approval for and commercialize  either directly or with collaborative partners  complex generic and follow on biologic products thereby providing high quality  effective  safe and affordable medicines to patients in need 
our complex generic programs target marketed products that were originally approved by the fda as new drug applications  or ndas 
therefore  we were able to access the existing generic regulatory pathway and submit abbreviated new drug applications  or andas  for these products 
enoxaparin sodium injection  formerly known as m enoxaparin  received fda marketing approval in july as a generic version of lovenox  which is used to prevent and treat deep vein thrombosis  or dvt  and to support the treatment of acute coronary syndromes  or acs 
lovenox is a complex mixture of polysaccharide chains derived from naturally sourced heparin 
our second major generic product program  m  is designed to be a generic version of copaxone glatiramer acetate injection  a drug that is indicated for the reduction of the frequency of relapses in patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis  or rrms 
copaxone consists of a complex mixture of polypeptide chains 
with m  we have extended our core characterization and process engineering capabilities from the characterization of complex polysaccharide mixtures to include the characterization of complex polypeptide mixtures 
the anda for m is currently under fda review 
in addition to our two complex generic programs  our follow on biologics  or fob  program further extends our proprietary technology platform to include the characterization and engineering of therapeutic protein products 
by thoroughly characterizing these molecules  which are derived from natural or cell based manufacturing processes  we seek to gain a deeper understanding of the 
table of contents relationship between the multiple steps involved in their manufacturing processes and the final product compositions 
our goal is to replicate our development approach with enoxaparin sodium injection and m to pursue the development and commercialization of follow on  or biosimilar including interchangeable  biologics 
our novel drug program leverages our characterization and process engineering capabilities to develop novel drugs by studying the structure activity of complex mixtures 
we are targeting our efforts to understand the relationship between structure and the biological and therapeutic activity of various complex molecule drug candidates 
our goal is to capitalize on the structural diversity and or the multi targeting potential of these complex molecules to engineer novel drug candidates that we believe will meet key unmet medical needs in various diseases 
while we believe that our capabilities to engineer improved and novel complex molecule drug candidates can be applied across several product categories with significant therapeutic potential  our most advanced efforts have been in the area of hspgs 
our lead novel hspg based drug candidate  adomiparin  has been engineered to possess what we believe will be an improved therapeutic profile compared with other currently marketed anticoagulants to support the treatment of acs 
m  our second novel hspg based drug candidate  is in early development as a potential anti cancer agent 
we also are seeking to discover and develop additional novel hspg based drugs  as well as improved and novel protein drug candidates by applying our technology to better understand the function of these complex molecules in biological processes 
in november  we entered into a collaboration and license agreement  or the sandoz collaboration  with sandoz nv and sandoz inc to jointly develop  manufacture and commercialize enoxaparin sodium injection 
sandoz nv later assigned its rights in the sandoz collaboration to sandoz ag 
we refer to sandoz ag and sandoz inc together as sandoz 
in and  we entered into a series of agreements  including a stock purchase agreement and an investor rights agreement  each with novartis pharma ag  and a collaboration and license agreement  or the definitive agreement  with sandoz ag  an affiliate of novartis pharma ag 
together  this series of agreements is referred to as the sandoz collaboration 
under the definitive agreement  we and sandoz ag jointly develop  manufacture and commercialize m in connection with the sandoz collaboration  we sold  shares of common stock to novartis pharma ag at a per share price of the closing price of our common stock on the nasdaq global market was on the date of purchase for an aggregate purchase price of million  resulting in an equity premium of million 
in july  sandoz began the commercial sale of enoxaparin sodium injection 
under the sandoz collaboration  in the event no third party competitors are marketing an interchangeable generic version of lovenox  or lovenox equivalent product as defined in the sandoz collaboration  sandoz will pay us of the contractual profits from the sale of enoxaparin sodium injection 
profits on sales of enoxaparin sodium injection are calculated by deducting from net sales the cost of goods sold and an allowance for selling  general and administrative costs  which is a contractual percentage of net sales 
if a third party competitor begins marketing a lovenox equivalent product  sandoz will instead pay us a royalty based on net sales of enoxaparin sodium injection at royalty rates ranging from high single digit to low double digits 
if the only lovenox equivalent product being marketed by a third party competitor is lovenox being marketed by sanofi aventis us llc  or sanofi aventis  as a generic drug  or licensed by sanofi aventis to another company to be sold as a generic drug  both known as authorized generics  sandoz will pay us a combination of a royalty payment based on net sales and a share of profits 
certain development and legal expenses may reduce the amount of profit share  royalty and milestone payments paid to us by sandoz 
any product liability costs and certain other expenses arising from patent litigation may also reduce the amount of profit share  royalty and milestone payments paid to us by sandoz  but only up to of these amounts due to us from sandoz each quarter 
our contractual share of these development and legal expenses is subject to an annual adjustment in each of the next five years  but the amount of any future payment due to the annual 
table of contents adjustment is not expected to be material 
because no third party competitors marketed a lovenox equivalent product during the year ended december   we earned million  net of million of development and legal expenses  in profit share product revenue from sandoz 
in addition to the profit share earned  we achieved a regulatory milestone defined in the sandoz collaboration as a result of the fda approval of the anda and received an additional million in research and development revenue from sandoz 
the future revenue that we recognize from the sale of enoxaparin sodium injection will depend on  among other things  whether any other generic versions of lovenox are approved by the fda  whether the lawsuit filed by sanofi aventis in july is partially or wholly successful at limiting sandoz sales of enoxaparin sodium injection and whether sandoz is able to continue commercialization of enoxaparin sodium injection 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
to date  we have devoted substantially all of our capital resource expenditures to the research and development of our product candidates 
prior to the launch of enoxaparin sodium injection  our revenue had been derived from our sandoz collaboration and sandoz collaboration and primarily consisted of amounts earned by us for reimbursement by sandoz of research and development services and development costs for certain programs 
in the second half of  we began to derive revenue from our profit share on the commercial sale of enoxaparin sodium injection 
we may still incur annual operating losses over the next several years as we expand our drug commercialization  development and discovery efforts 
additionally  we plan to continue to evaluate possible acquisitions or licensing of rights to additional technologies  products or assets that fit within our growth strategy 
accordingly  we will need to generate significant revenue to maintain profitability 
financial operations overview revenue we have recognized  in the aggregate  million of revenue from our inception through december  this revenue was derived entirely from our sandoz collaboration and sandoz collaboration 
we will seek to generate revenue from a combination of research and development payments  profit sharing payments  milestone payments and royalties in connection with our sandoz collaboration and sandoz collaboration and similar future collaborative or strategic relationships 
in the near term  our current and future revenues are dependent upon the continued sale of enoxaparin sodium injection 
in the longer term  our revenue growth will be dependent upon the successful pursuit of external business development opportunities and clinical development  regulatory approval and launch of new commercial products 
we expect that any revenue we generate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the amount and timing of profit share and royalty payments we receive and the timing and amount of research and development and other payments received under our collaborative or strategic relationships 
research and development research and development expenses consist of costs incurred in identifying  developing and testing product candidates 
these expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel  license fees  consulting fees  clinical trial costs  contract research and manufacturing costs  and the costs of laboratory equipment and facilities 
we expense research and development costs as incurred 
due to the variability in the length of time necessary to develop a product  the uncertainties related to the estimated cost of the projects and ultimate ability to obtain governmental approval for commercialization  accurate and meaningful estimates of the ultimate cost to bring our product candidates to market are not available 

table of contents commercial and development programs the following summarizes our primary commercial and development programs enoxaparin sodium injection enoxaparin sodium injection  our first product to receive marketing approval under an anda  is a generic version of lovenox  a complex drug consisting of a mixture of polysaccharide chains 
lovenox is a widely prescribed lmwh used for the prevention and treatment of dvt and to support the treatment of acs 
lovenox is distributed worldwide by sanofi aventis and is also known outside the united states as clexane and klexane 
under our sandoz collaboration  we work with sandoz exclusively to develop  manufacture and commercialize enoxaparin sodium injection in the united states and sandoz is responsible for funding substantially all of the united states related enoxaparin sodium injection development  regulatory  legal and commercialization costs 
sandoz submitted andas in its name to the fda for enoxaparin sodium injection in syringe and vial forms  seeking approval to market enoxaparin sodium injection in the united states 
the anda for the syringe form of enoxaparin sodium injection was approved in july the fda is currently reviewing the anda for the vial form of enoxaparin sodium injection 
in july  sanofi aventis filed a lawsuit in the united states district court for the district of columbia against the fda  margaret a 
hamburg  commissioner of food and drugs  and kathleen sebelius  secretary of health and human services 
the complaint alleged  among other things  that fda approval of the anda filed by sandoz for enoxaparin sodium injection was arbitrary and capricious and exceeded fda statutory authority by requiring additional data for the purpose of demonstrating the safety or effectiveness of a generic version of lovenox and departing from its own precedent governing the approval of generic drugs that have not been fully characterized 
the lawsuit sought  among other things  a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction directing the fda to suspend and withdraw its approval of the anda filed by sandoz for enoxaparin sodium injection 
in august  the court denied the motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction 
in december  sanofi aventis filed a motion for summary judgment seeking a reversal of the fda approval and the defendants have each filed responses opposing the motion and filed cross motions seeking to affirm the approval of sandoz anda for enoxaparin sodium injection 
we believe that sanofi aventis claims are without merit and are cooperating with sandoz to vigorously oppose the lawsuit and uphold the fda approval 
in december  we sued teva pharmaceutical industries ltd  or teva  in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts for infringement of two of our patents 
the patents claim methods of producing enoxaparin having specified quality attributes 
we will continue to prosecute this case and enforce our patents 
m m is designed to be a generic version of copaxone  a complex drug consisting of a mixture of polypeptide chains 
copaxone is indicated for reduction of the frequency of relapses in patients with rrms 
multiple sclerosis is a chronic disease of the central nervous system characterized by inflammation and neurodegeneration 
in north america  copaxone is marketed by teva neuroscience llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of teva pharmaceutical industries ltd 
in europe  copaxone is marketed by teva pharmaceutical industries ltd 
and sanofi aventis 
in december  our collaborative partner  sandoz  submitted to the fda an anda in its name containing a paragraph iv certification seeking approval to market m in the united states 
in july  the fda notified sandoz that it had accepted the anda for review as of december  in addition  the fda published database indicates that the first substantially complete anda submitted 
table of contents for glatiramer acetate injection containing a paragraph iv certification was filed on december   making sandoz anda eligible for the grant of a day generic exclusivity period upon approval 
under applicable laws  there are a number of ways an anda applicant may forfeit its day exclusivity  including if the applicant fails to achieve at least tentative approval within months after the date on which the anda is filed 
because tentative approval for the m anda was not received in the specified months  the day exclusivity period will be forfeited unless the exception to the forfeiture rule applies 
we will not know whether the exception applies unless and until the fda approves the anda 
the review of sandoz anda is ongoing 
we and sandoz are in regular communication with the fda to address any additional questions or requests that it may have as it continues the review of sandoz application follow on biologics fobs program we are also applying our technology platform to the development of fobs  including both generic designated by fda to be interchangeable and biosimilar versions of marketed therapeutic proteins 
therapeutic proteins represent a sizable segment of the us drug industry  with sales expected to be approximately billion in given the inadequacies of standard technology  many of these therapeutic proteins have not been thoroughly characterized 
most of these products are complex glycoprotein mixtures  consisting of proteins that contain branched sugars that vary from molecule to molecule 
these sugars can impart specific biological properties to the glycoprotein drug and can often comprise a significant portion of the mass of the molecule 
in addition to the structural characterization of several marketed therapeutic proteins  we are also advancing our structure process capabilities as we further define the relationship between aspects of the manufacturing process and the structural composition of the final protein product 
we believe that our investment in our analytics and characterization technology coupled with our investment in the science of better understanding the relationship of the biologic manufacturing process to structural composition provides us with the opportunity develop a competitive advantage for our future fob product candidates 
most protein drugs have been approved by the fda under the biologics license application  or bla  regulatory pathway 
the bla pathway was created to review and approve applications for biologic drugs that are typically produced from living systems 
until  there was no abbreviated regulatory pathway for the approval of generic or biosimilar versions of bla approved products in the united states  however  there have been guidelines for biosimilar products in the european union for several years 
in march  with the enactment of the biologics price competition and innovation act of  or bpci  an abbreviated pathway for the approval of fobs was created 
the new abbreviated regulatory pathway establishes legal authority for the fda to review and approve biosimilar biologics  including the possible designation of a biosimilar as interchangeable  based on their similarity to existing brand product 
under the bpci  an application for a biosimilar product cannot be approved by the fda until years after the original brand product was approved under a bla 
there are many biologics at this time for which this year period has expired or is nearing expiration 
we believe that scientific progress in the analysis and characterization of complex mixture drugs is likely to play a significant role in fda approval of biosimilar including interchangeable biologics in the years to come 
the new law is complex and is only beginning to be interpreted and implemented by the fda 
as a result  its ultimate impact  implementation and meaning will be subject to uncertainty for years to come 

table of contents adomiparin adomiparin  formerly referred to as m  is a novel anticoagulant that is a complex drug consisting of a mixture of polysaccharide chains 
adomiparin was rationally designed to capture  in a single therapy  the positive attributes of both unfractionated heparin reversibility  monitorability and broad inhibition of the coagulation cascade and lmwh adequate bioavailability and predictable pharmacokinetics to allow for convenient subcutaneous administration 
we believe that adomiparin has the potential to replace these agents and provide a safer  more effective and easier to use baseline anticoagulant therapy for the medical management of patients diagnosed with acs who may or may not require coronary intervention in order to treat their condition 
we believe that the properties of adomiparin observed to date in both preclinical and clinical investigations continue to support the design hypothesis and may provide physicians with a more flexible treatment option than is currently available 
acs includes several diseases ranging from unstable angina  which is characterized by chest pain at rest  to acute myocardial infarction  or heart attack  which is caused by a complete blockage of a coronary artery 
currently  a majority of patients are initially medically managed with an anti clotting agent  such as lmwh or unfractionated heparin  or ufh  in combination with other therapies 
neither lmwh nor ufh were developed specifically for patients with acs  and both have numerous clinical disadvantages 
an increasing proportion of acs patients are also proceeding to early intervention with procedures such as angioplasty or coronary artery bypass grafting  or cabg 
both angioplasty and cabg require anticoagulant therapy to prevent clot formation during and immediately following the procedure 
adomiparin is designed to be a lmwh that could be used in multiple settings  including initial medical management  angioplasty or cabg 
in july  we filed an investigational new drug application  or ind  with the fda for our adomiparin intravenous injection product candidate and in october began phase clinical trials to evaluate its human safety  tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile 
in june  we completed a phase a clinical trial to evaluate the feasibility of utilizing adomiparin intravenous injection as an anticoagulant in patients with stable coronary artery disease undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention 
this trial  known as eminence evaluation of m in percutaneous coronary intervention  enrolled approximately patients with stable coronary artery disease undergoing elective percutaneous coronary intervention 
patients were randomly assigned to receive treatment with one of three doses of intravenous adomiparin or a standard dose of ufh 
the primary endpoint of the study was the combined incidence of clinical events defined as the composite of death  myocardial infarction  repeat revascularization  and stroke over thirty days  incidence of bleeding and thrombocytopenia over the first hours  and bailout use of glycoprotein iib iiia inhibitors and catheter thrombus during the procedure 
the primary analysis in the study provided evidence of non inferiority of the combined adomiparin group combining all three doses as compared to the ufh group within the parameters of the prospectively defined analysis 
the observed incidence of the primary endpoint was lower in all adomiparin treatment groups than in the ufh group  however it should be noted that the study was not designed or powered to detect statistically significant differences between treatments 
the incidence of serious and non serious adverse events was comparable in all treatment groups 
in march  we submitted an ind for our adomiparin subcutaneous injection product candidate and in may began phase clinical trials to evaluate its human safety  tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile 
these trials have been completed 
we believe that the results of clinical trials conducted to date support continuing the evaluation of adomiparin in patients diagnosed with acs who are medically managed with or without an intervention 
we are seeking a collaborative partner to finance and support the further clinical development of adomiparin 
we will not start additional clinical trials until we have a partner or funding available  but we remain committed to the product and its continued development 

table of contents m m is our next most advanced novel hspg based product candidate and is engineered to have potent anti cancer properties and low anticoagulant activity 
hspgs are complex molecules present in the tumor microenvironment which present growth factors  cytokines  and chemokines necessary for tumor cell growth  migration and survival 
m is designed to exploit this biology by binding to and down regulating multiple factors involved in disease progression and metastasis 
data from multiple preclinical studies have shown that m has the potential to modulate angiogenesis and tumor progression and metastasis through a variety of hspg binding proteins 
a preclinical study  in collaboration with the cancer research institute cambridge  uk  demonstrated the efficacy of m in a murine pancreatic cancer model 
the study showed that m  in combination with gemcitabine  significantly improved survival and substantially lowered the incidence of metastasis compared to mice treated with gemcitabine alone 
we currently have plans to advance m into human clinical trials in it is anticipated that m will be used in combination with standard of care cytotoxic regimens for the treatment of advanced malignancies 
discovery program hspg and proteins our most advanced efforts have been in the area of hspgs 
we believe our analytical tools enable new insights into exploring the biology of many diseases  which will lead to an enhanced understanding of the relative role of different biological targets and related cell to cell signaling pathways 
with hspgs  our goal is to leverage the multi targeting nature of these molecules to develop novel hspg based therapeutics each of which we could positively affect multiple pathways in a disease with a single drug 
because of the broad role of hspgs in biology  we plan to target multiple disease areas with this therapeutic approach 
while not yet as advanced as our hspg program  we also are extending these biological systems insights into the development of improved and more targeted protein therapeutics 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel in executive  finance  legal  accounting  investor relations  information technology  business development and human resource functions 
other costs include facility and insurance costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses and professional fees for legal and accounting services and other general expenses 
results of operations years ended december   and collaboration revenue collaboration revenue for was million  compared with million for and million for 
table of contents collaboration revenues are summarized as follows for years ended december  in thousands product revenue milestone revenue research and development revenue total research and development revenue total collaboration revenue the increase in collaboration revenue from to was due primarily to product revenue we earned from sandoz representing our profit share on sandoz sales of enoxaparin sodium injection following its commercial launch in july due to the fda approval of the enoxaparin sodium injection anda  sandoz made a non refundable milestone payment of million to us in research and development revenue for the years ended december   and consists of amounts earned by us under the sandoz collaboration for reimbursement of research and development services and reimbursement of development costs  and amounts earned by us under the sandoz collaboration for amortization of the equity premium  reimbursement of research and development services and reimbursement of development costs 
research and development revenue decreased million from to due primarily to a decrease in reimbursable expenses associated with the development of enoxaparin sodium injection 
research and development revenue increased million from to due primarily to a million increase in reimbursable process engineering activities associated with our m program and a million increase in reimbursable expenses associated with our enoxaparin sodium injection program  primarily for development services related to the anda review process 
these increases were offset by a million decrease in reimbursable expenses associated with our m program  as planned development activities on the m program were completed in because sandoz only launched enoxaparin sodium injection in july  there are a number of factors that make it difficult to predict the magnitude of future enoxaparin sodium injection product revenue  including how long we will remain the sole generic competitor to the brand product receiving of the contractual profits compared to receiving a royalty based on net sales of enoxaparin sodium injection  the inventory levels of enoxpaparin sodium injection maintained by wholesalers  distributors and other customers  the frequency of re orders by existing customers  the change in estimates for product reserves  the pricing of products that compete with enoxaparin sodium injection and other actions taken by our competitors 
accordingly  our enoxaparin sodium injection collaboration revenue in previous quarters may not be indicative of future enoxaparin sodium injection collaboration revenue 
as a result of these and other factors  future enoxaparin sodium injection collaboration revenue could decline or could vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
research and development expense research and development expense for was million  compared with million in and million in the decrease of million  or  from to resulted from decreases of million in process development  manufacturing and third party research costs in support of our development programs  principally our m program  million in consultant costs and million in clinical development costs both of which were associated with the completion in july of the phase a clinical trial for our adomiparin program  million in laboratory expenses related to our enoxaparin sodium injection program  million in depreciation expense and facility 
table of contents related expense and million in share based compensation expense 
these decreases were offset by increases of million in personnel and related costs primarily due to performance payments made in connection with the approval and launch of enoxaparin sodium injection in july and a million credit to research and development expense as a result of a revision to an accrued milestone liability in the increase of research and development expense of million  or  from to principally resulted from increases of million in manufacturing  process development and third party research costs primarily in support of our m program  million in share based compensation expense  million in depreciation and facility related expense  million in personnel and related costs  and million in consultant costs 
these increases were offset by decreases of million in clinical development costs associated with the completion in july of the phase a clinical trial for our adomiparin program  a million credit to research and development expense as a result of a revision to an accrued milestone liability  and a decrease of million in laboratory supplies 
the lengthy process of securing fda approval for new drugs requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals would materially adversely affect our product development efforts and our business overall 
accordingly  we cannot currently estimate with any degree of certainty the amount of time or money that we will be required to expend in the future on our product candidates prior to their regulatory approval  if such approval is ever granted 
as a result of these uncertainties surrounding the timing and outcome of any approvals  we are currently unable to estimate when  if ever  our product candidates will generate revenues and cash flows 
we expect future research and development expenses to increase in support of our product candidates 
the following table summarizes the primary components of our research and development expenditures for our principal commercial and development programs for the years ended december    and  and it shows the total external costs incurred by us for each of our major commercial and development projects 
the table excludes costs incurred by our collaborative partner on such major commercial and development projects 
we do not maintain or evaluate  and therefore do not allocate  internal research and development costs on a project by project basis 
consequently  we do not analyze internal research and development costs by project in managing our research and development activities

the decrease of million in adomiparin external expenditures from to 
table of contents was due to the completion of our phase a clinical trial in june the increase of million in the other development programs from to primarily related to an increase in m manufacturing  preclinical and toxicology work 
the increase of million in external expenditures for enoxaparin sodium injection from to was primarily due to increased development services related to the anda review process 
the increase in m external expenditures of million from to was due to increased process development  manufacturing costs and third party research expenses 
the decrease of million in adomiparin external expenditures from to was due to the completion of our phase a clinical trial in june the research and development internal costs consist of compensation and other expense for research and development personnel  supplies and materials  facility costs and depreciation 
the increase of million from to was due to additional research and development headcount and related costs in support of our development programs 
general and administrative general and administrative expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million in and million in general and administrative expense increased by million  or  from to due to increases of million in royalty and license fees payable to massachusetts institute of technology associated with the launch and sales of enoxaparin sodium injection  million in professional and other fees primarily due to a increase in legal and consulting activities  million in personnel and related costs primarily due to performance payments made in connection with the approval and launch of enoxaparin sodium injection in july  and a increase in share based compensation expense 
general and administrative expense decreased by million  or  from to primarily due to a decrease of million in professional fees due to a reduction in legal and consulting activities  offset by an increase of million in share based compensation expense 
we expect our general and administrative expenses  including internal and external legal and business development costs that support our various product development efforts  to vary from period to period in relation to our commercial and development activities 
interest income interest income was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease of million from to and the decrease of million from to were primarily due to lower average investment balances and lower interest rates 
interest expense interest expense was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease of million from to and the decrease of million from to were primarily due to the completion of repayment schedules on our equipment line of credit during and other income expense other income of million for the year ended december  was due to the receipt of a tax grant related to the approval of our application for the qualifying therapeutic discovery project program during 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations since inception primarily through the sale of equity securities  payments from our sandoz collaboration and sandoz collaboration  including profit share payments related to product sales of enoxaparin sodium injection  and borrowings from our lines of credit and capital lease obligations 
since our inception  we have received million through private and public issuance of equity securities  including the issuance of shares to novartis pharma ag in connection with our sandoz collaboration 
as of december   we have received a cumulative total of million from our sandoz collaboration and sandoz collaboration  million from debt financing  million from capital lease obligations and million from our landlord for leasehold improvements related to our corporate facility and additional funds from interest income 
the length of time we remain the sole generic competitor to lovenox  and therefore continue to receive a profit share compared to a royalty based on net sales of enoxaparin sodium injection  will have a notable impact on our near term cash trend 
we expect to finance our current and planned operating requirements principally through our current cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
we believe that these funds will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements through at least however  our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary materially 
we may  from time to time  seek additional funding through a combination of new collaborative agreements  strategic alliances and additional equity and debt financings or from other sources 
at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and million in accounts receivable 
in addition  we also hold million in restricted cash which serves as collateral for a letter of credit related to our facility lease 
our funds at december  were primarily invested in senior debt of government sponsored enterprises and united states money market funds  directly or through managed funds  with remaining maturities of months or less 
our cash is deposited in and invested through highly rated financial institutions in north america 
the composition and mix of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities may change frequently as a result of our evaluation of conditions in the financial markets  the maturity of specific investments  and our near term liquidity needs 
we do not believe that our cash equivalents and marketable securities were subject to significant risk at december  during the years ended december   and  our operating activities used million  million and million  respectively 
the use of cash for operating activities generally approximates our net income loss adjusted for non cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
for the year ended december   our net income adjusted for non cash items was million 
for the year ended december   non cash items include share based compensation of million and depreciation and amortization of property and equipment and intangible assets of million 
in addition  the net change in our operating assets and liabilities used million and resulted from an increase in accounts receivable of million  primarily due to the timing of cash receipts from sandoz related to our share of sandoz profit from sales of enoxaparin sodium injection during the third and fourth quarters of  an increase in unbilled revenue of million  resulting from increased manufacturing costs for m batches  an increase in accrued expenses of million  due to an accrual for royalties payable to mit based on our share of sandoz profit from sales of enoxaparin sodium injection during the third and fourth quarters of and an increase in the bonus pool for related performance  and a decrease in deferred revenue of million  principally due to the amortization of the million equity premium paid by novartis in connection with the sandoz collaboration

critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  accrued expenses and share based payments 
we base our estimates on historical experience  known trends and events and various other 
table of contents factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of product has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we receive revenue from research and development collaboration agreements 
we record revenue on an accrual basis as it is earned and when amounts are considered collectible 
revenue received in advance of performance obligations or in cases where we have a continuing obligation to perform services are deferred and recognized over the performance period 
when we are required to defer revenue  the period over which such revenue is recognized is based on estimates by management and may change over the course of the performance period 
at the inception of a collaboration agreement  we estimate the term of our performance obligation based on our development plans and our estimate of the regulatory review period 
the development plans generally include designing a manufacturing process to make the drug product  scaling up the process  contributing to the preparation of regulatory filings  further scaling up the manufacturing process to commercial scale and related development of intellectual property 
each reporting period we reassess our remaining performance obligations under the applicable collaboration arrangement by considering the time period over which any remaining development and related services to be provided prior to obtaining regulatory approval are expected to be completed 
changes in our estimate could occur due to changes in our development plans or due to changes in regulatory or legal requirements 
product revenue profit share and or royalty revenue is reported as product revenue and is recognized based upon net sales of licensed products in licensed territories as provided by the collaboration agreement in the period the sales occur 
these amounts are determined based on amounts provided by the collaboration partner and involve the use of estimates and judgments  such as product sales allowances and accruals related to prompt payment discounts  chargebacks  governmental and other rebates  distributor  wholesaler and group purchasing organizations  or gpo  fees  and product returns  which could be adjusted based on actual results in the future 
research and development revenue revenue from non refundable  up front license fees is reported as research and development revenue and is recognized on a straight line basis over the contracted or estimated period of performance  which is typically the development term 
research and development funding is recognized as earned over the period of effort 
milestone payments are recognized as research and development revenue upon achievement of the milestone only if the milestone payment is non refundable  substantive effort is involved in achieving the milestone and the amount of the milestone is reasonable in relation to the effort expended or the risk associated with achievement of the milestone 
if any of these conditions are not met  the milestone payment is deferred and recognized as revenue over the estimated remaining period of performance under the contract as we complete our performance obligations 

table of contents cash and cash equivalents we consider only those investments which are highly liquid  readily convertible to cash and that mature within three months from date of purchase to be cash equivalents 
cash equivalents are carried at fair value  which approximates cost  and were primarily comprised of money market funds at december  marketable securities available for sale debt securities are recorded at fair market value 
purchased premiums or discounts on debt securities are amortized to interest income through the stated maturities of the debt securities 
we determine the appropriate classification of our investments in marketable securities at the time of purchase and evaluate such designation as of each balance sheet date 
unrealized gains and losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  which is reported as a separate component of stockholders equity 
if a decline in the fair value is considered other than temporary  based on available evidence  the unrealized loss is transferred from other comprehensive income loss to the statements of operations 
there were no charges taken for other than temporary declines in fair value of marketable securities in  or realized gains and losses are reported in interest income on a specific identification basis 
during the year ended december   we recorded realized gains on marketable securities of  there were no realized gains or losses on marketable securities during the years ended december  or fair value of other financial instruments the carrying amounts of our financial instruments that are not stated at fair value  which include accounts receivable  unbilled collaboration revenue and other accrued expenses  approximate their fair values due to their short maturities 
the carrying amount of our line of credit and capital lease obligations approximate their fair values due to their variable interest rates 
intangible assets we have acquired intangible assets that we value and record 
we use a discounted cash flow model to value intangible assets at acquisition 
the discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future cash inflows and outflows  risk and the cost of capital 
each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset 
we review intangible assets for impairment on a periodic basis using an undiscounted net cash flows approach when impairment indicators arise 
if the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value of an intangible asset  we would write down the intangible asset to the discounted cash flow value 
where we cannot identify cash flows for an individual asset  our review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable 
share based compensation we recognize the fair value of share based compensation in our statement of operations 
share based compensation expense primarily relates to stock options  restricted stock and stock issued under our stock option plans and employee stock purchase plan 
we recognize share based compensation expense equal to the fair value of stock options on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
restricted stock awards are recorded as compensation cost  based on the market value on the date of the grant  on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
we issue new shares to satisfy stock option exercises  the issuance of restricted stock and stock issued under our employee stock purchase plan 
we estimate the fair value of each option award on the date of grant using the black scholes merton option pricing model 
option valuation models require the input of highly subjective 
table of contents assumptions  including stock price volatility and expected term of an option 
we believe a blended volatility rate based upon historical performance  as well as the implied volatilities of currently traded options  best reflects the expected volatility of our stock going forward 
changes in market price directly affect volatility and could cause share based compensation expense to vary significantly in future reporting periods 
the expected term of awards represents the period of time that the awards are expected to be outstanding 
we use a blend of our own historical employee exercise and post vest termination behavior and expected term data from our peer group to arrive at the estimated expected life of an option 
we update these assumptions as needed to reflect recent historical data 
additionally  we are required to estimate forfeiture rates to approximate the number of shares that will vest in a period to which the fair value is applied 
estimated forfeitures will be adjusted to actual forfeitures upon the vest date of the cancelled options as a cumulative adjustment on a quarterly basis 
the value of our restricted stock awards is recognized as compensation cost in our consolidated statements of operations over each award explicit or implicit service periods 
we estimate an award implicit service period based on our best estimate of the period over which an award vesting conditions will be achieved 
we reevaluate these estimates on a quarterly basis and will recognize any remaining unrecognized compensation as of the date of an estimate revision over the revised remaining implicit service period 
recently issued accounting standards please see note to our consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies  for a discussion of new accounting standards 
the notes to our consolidated financial statements are contained in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
our current investment policy is to maintain an investment portfolio consisting mainly of us money market  government secured  and high grade corporate securities  directly or through managed funds  with maturities of twenty four months or less 
our cash is deposited in and invested through highly rated financial institutions in north america 
our marketable securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
however  due to the conservative nature of our investments  low prevailing market rates and relatively short effective maturities of debt instruments  interest rate risk is mitigated 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels at december   we estimate that the fair value of our investment portfolio would decline by an immaterial amount 
we do not own derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
accordingly  we do not believe that there is any material market risk exposure with respect to derivative  foreign currency or other financial instruments that would require disclosure under this item
