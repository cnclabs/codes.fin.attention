we have expressed our intent to separate our casual games business from the rest of our businesses and  during the year  we continued to make progress on that separation 
no timetable has been set for the separation and we have not determined the optimal structure of the separated games business  including whether we will retain control of the business or enter into another strategic transaction involving the business

impairment of deferred costs and prepaid royalties we assess the recovery of all deferred project costs and any royalty advances paid to content providers on a quarterly basis 
as of december   we determined that the total estimated costs associated with certain projects exceeded the total estimated revenues expected to be recognized on those projects 
as a result  we impaired approximately million in deferred project costs 
in addition  we assessed the recovery of recoupable royalty advances paid to certain content providers 
as of december   we determined that approximately million in royalty advances was not recoverable and therefore charged to expense

see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for more information 
no such charges existed in or 
table of contents assessing the recoverability of deferred project costs and prepaid royalty advances is based on significant assumptions and estimates  including future revenue and cost of sales 
significant or sustained decreases in revenue or increases in cost of sales in future periods could result in additional impairments of deferred project costs and prepaid royalty advances 
we cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of such impairments 
should the value of deferred project costs or prepaid royalty advances become impaired  we would record the appropriate charge  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations

the decrease of million in tax expense from to was primarily due to the smaller increase in valuation allowance in compared to we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered 
in making this assessment  many factors are considered including the current economic climate  our expectations of future taxable income  our ability to project such income  and the appreciation of our investments and other assets

changes in certain operating assets and liabilities  net of acquisitions  in the year ended december  primarily consisted of an increase of million in prepaid expenses and other assets due primarily to increases in prepaid royalties  and a decrease in accounts payable of million due primarily to a decrease in amounts due to third party content providers  partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of million related to decreases in revenue associated with our systems integration business 
in the year ended december   investing activities used cash primarily for payments made in connection with the restructuring of rhapsody of million  purchases of equipment  software  and leasehold improvements of million  as well as a million payment of acquisition costs for backstage  net of cash acquired 
these uses of cash were partially offset by the repayment of temporary funding upon the deconsolidation of rhapsody of approximately million 
purchases  net of sales and maturities  of short term investments provided cash of million during in the year ended december   investing activities provided cash primarily from the sales and maturities  net of purchases  of short term investments of approximately million 
uses of cash during included the purchases of equipment  software and leasehold improvements of million and the payment of acquisition costs of million primarily related to the payment of anniversary and performance costs relating to the acquisition of zylom  which were previously accrued 
in the year ended december   investing activities used cash primarily for purchases of equipment  software  and leasehold improvements of million and acquisition costs of million  net of cash acquired from the acquisition of trymedia  and the payment of anniversary and performance costs relating to the acquisition of zylom  which were previously accrued 
purchases net of sales and maturities of short term investments used cash of million during financing activities in the year ended december  provided cash from the proceeds of sales of common stock under employee stock purchase plans and the exercise of stock options of million 
financing activities provided cash from the proceeds of sales of interests in rhapsody of million as well as sales of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan and exercise of stock options of million in the year ended december  financing activities in used cash for the repurchase of our common stock of million  in addition to payments on our convertible debt obligations of million in these uses of cash were partially offset by the proceeds of sales of interests in rhapsody of million as well as sales of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan and exercise of stock options of million 
our board of directors has previously authorized share repurchase programs for the repurchase of our outstanding common stock  and all repurchases have been made pursuant to these authorized programs 
during  we repurchased million shares for an aggregate payment of million at an average cost of per share 
the purchases made through december  completed the authorized amount for all of the repurchase programs 
we currently have no planned significant capital expenditures for other than those in the ordinary course of business 
in the future  we may seek to raise additional funds through public or private equity financing  or through other sources such as credit facilities 
the sale of additional equity securities could result in dilution to our shareholders 
in addition  in the future  we may enter into cash or stock acquisition transactions or 
table of contents other strategic transactions that could reduce cash available to fund our operations or result in dilution to shareholders 
our principal commitments include office leases and contractual payments due to content and other service providers 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
we do not hold derivative financial instruments or equity securities in our short term investment portfolio 
our cash equivalents and short term investments consist of high quality securities  as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
the policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one non us government or non us agency issue or issuer to a maximum of of the total portfolio 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if interest rates increase 
because we have historically had the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity  we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be significantly affected by a sudden change in market interest rates in our securities portfolio 
we conduct our operations primarily in five functional currencies the us dollar  the korean won  the japanese yen  the british pound and the euro 
historically  neither fluctuations in foreign exchange rates nor changes in foreign economic conditions have had a significant impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
we currently do not hedge the majority of our foreign currency exposures and are therefore subject to risk from exchange rate fluctuations 
we invoice our international customers primarily in us dollars  except in korea  japan  germany  france and the united kingdom  where we invoice our customers primarily in the respective local currencies 
we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations also arises from intercompany payables and receivables to and from our foreign subsidiaries 
at december   we had commitments to make the following payments contractual obligations total less than year years years after years in thousands office leases other contractual obligations total contractual cash obligations other contractual obligations primarily relate to minimum contractual payments due to content and other service providers 
in addition to the amounts shown in the table above  million of unrecognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities in accordance with fasb asc previously fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled 
we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of related future payments for such liability 
off balance sheet arrangements our only significant off balance sheet arrangements relate to operating lease obligations for office facility leases and other contractual obligations related primarily to minimum contractual payments due to content and other service providers 
future annual minimum rental lease payments and other contractual obligations are included in the commitment schedule above 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period 
our critical accounting policies and estimates are as follows revenue recognition  estimating music publishing rights and music royalties  
table of contents estimating recoverability of deferred costs  estimating allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns  estimating losses on excess office facilities  valuation of equity method investments  valuation of available for sale securities  valuation of long lived assets  valuation of goodwill  stock based compensation  noncontrolling interest  accounting for gains on sale of subsidiary stock  and accounting for income taxes 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
physical products are considered delivered to the customer once they have been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred 
for online sales  the products or services are considered delivered at the time the product or services are made available  digitally  to the end user 
we recognize revenue on a gross or net basis 
in most arrangements  we contract directly with end user customers  are the primary obligor and carry all collectability risk 
in such arrangements  we recognize revenue on a gross basis 
in some cases  we utilize third party distributors to sell products or services directly to end user customers and carry no collectability risk 
in such instances  we recognize revenue on a net basis 
in our direct to consumer business segments  we derive revenue through subscriptions of superpass within our core products segment and subscriptions sold by our games segment  sales of content downloads  software and licenses offered by our core products  emerging products and games segments and the sale of advertising and the distribution of third party products on our websites and in our games 
prior to april   our direct to consumer business also included the products and services offered by our music segment  which was primarily sold by the rhapsody joint venture 
beginning on april   revenue from the rhapsody joint venture is no longer consolidated within our financial statements and we are no longer recording any operating or other financial results for the former music segment 
consumer subscription products are paid in advance  typically for monthly  quarterly or annual duration 
subscription revenue is recognized ratably over the related subscription time period 
revenue from sales of content downloads  software and licenses is recognized at the time the product is made available  digitally  to the end user 
revenue generated from advertising on our websites and from advertising and the distribution of third party products included in our products is recognized as revenue at the time of delivery 
we also generate revenue through business to business channels by providing services within our core products segment enabling mobile carriers to deliver audio and video content to their customers and by selling software licenses and products and related support and other services 
revenue generated from services provided to mobile carriers that enable the delivery of audio and video content to their customers is recognized as the services are provided 
setup fees to build these services are recognized ratably upon launch of the service over the remaining expected term of the service 
a portion of the revenue related to the sale of software licenses and products and related support and other services is recorded as unearned due to undelivered elements including  in some cases  post delivery support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades or enhancements on a when and if available basis 
the amount of revenue allocated to undelivered elements is based on the vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for those elements using the residual method or relative fair value method 
unearned revenue due to undelivered elements is recognized ratably on a straight line basis over the related products contract term 

table of contents estimating music publishing rights and music royalty accruals 
we must make estimates of amounts owed related to our music publishing rights and music royalties for our domestic and international music services primarily incurred by rhapsody which was separated from our operating results beginning april  unsettled obligations incurred prior to april  remain our liability 
material differences may impact the amount and timing of our expense for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
under copyright law  we may be required to pay licensing fees for digital sound recordings and compositions we deliver 
copyright law generally does not specify the rate and terms of the licenses  which are determined by voluntary negotiations among the parties or  for certain compulsory licenses where voluntary negotiations are unsuccessful  by arbitration 
there are certain geographies and agencies for which we have not yet completed negotiations with regard to the royalty rate to be applied to the current or historic sales of our digital music offerings 
our estimates are based on contracted or statutory rates  when established  or management s best estimates based on facts and circumstances regarding the specific music services and agreements in similar geographies or with similar agencies 
while we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
estimating recoverability of deferred costs 
we defer costs on projects for service revenue and system sales 
deferred costs consist primarily of direct and incremental costs to customize and install systems  as defined in individual customer contracts  including costs to acquire hardware and software from third parties and payroll costs for our employees and other third parties 
we recognize such costs as a component of cost of revenue  the timing of which is dependent upon the revenue recognition policy by contract 
for revenue recognized under the completed contract method  costs are deferred until the products are delivered  or upon completion of services or  where applicable  customer acceptance 
for revenue recognized under the percentage of completion method  costs are recognized as products are delivered or services are provided in accordance with the percentage of completion calculation 
for revenue recognized ratably over the term of the contract  costs are recognized ratably over the term of the contract  commencing on the date of revenue recognition 
at each balance sheet date  we review deferred costs to ensure they are ultimately recoverable 
any anticipated losses on uncompleted contracts are recognized when evidence indicates the estimated total cost of a contract exceeds its estimated total revenue 
estimating allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns 
we make estimates of the uncollectible portion of our accounts receivable 
we specifically analyze the age of accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
similarly  we make estimates of potential future product returns related to current period revenue 
we analyze historical returns  current economic trends  and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns allowance 
significant judgments and estimates are made and used in connection with establishing allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if we were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates or actual future experience was different from the judgments and estimates 
estimating losses on excess office facilities 
we made significant estimates in determining the appropriate amount of accrued loss on excess office facilities 
if we made different estimates  our loss on excess office facilities could be significantly different from that recorded  which could have a material impact on our operating results 
valuation of equity method investments 
we use the equity method in circumstances where we have the ability to exert significant influence  but not control  over an investee or joint venture 
we initially record our investment based on a fair value analysis of the investment 
prior to  most of our equity method investments were purchased with cash which was determined to be fair value 
for the investment in rhapsody as of march   we used multiple valuation models that were based on assumptions of future results  including operating and cash flow projections  to calculate the fair value since we contributed both cash and non cash items in exchange for our equity interest 

table of contents we record our percentage interest in the investee or joint venture s income or loss under this method  which will increase or decrease the value of the investment 
we record investee losses up to the aggregate amount of the investment 
we would evaluate impairment of an investment valued under the equity method only if events and circumstances warrant 
an impairment charge would be recorded whenever a decline in value of an equity investment below its carrying amount is determined to be other than temporary 
in determining if a decline is other than temporary  we consider factors such as the length of time and extent to which the fair value of the investment has been less than the carrying amount of the investee or joint venture  the near term and longer term operating and financial prospects of the investee or joint venture and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery 
valuation of available for sale securities 
our investments in publicly traded companies are accounted for as available for sale and are carried at current market value 
we periodically evaluate whether any declines in fair value of our available for sale securities are other than temporary based on a review of qualitative and quantitative factors 
for investments with publicly quoted market prices  these factors include the time period and extent by which its accounting basis exceeds its quoted market price 
we consider additional factors to determine whether declines in fair value are other than temporary  such as the investee s financial condition  results of operations  and operating trends 
the evaluation also considers publicly available information regarding the investee companies 
valuation of long lived assets 
long lived assets consist primarily of property  plant and equipment  as well as amortizable intangible assets acquired in business combinations 
long lived assets are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amount to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
if long lived assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair market value 
the impairment analysis of long lived assets is based upon estimates and assumptions relating to our future revenue  cash flows  operating expenses  costs of capital and capital purchases 
these estimates and assumptions are complex and subject to a significant degree of judgment with respect to certain factors including  but not limited to  the cash flows of our long term operating plans  market and interest rate risk  and risk commensurate discount rates and cost of capital 
significant or sustained declines in future revenue or cash flows  or adverse changes in our business climate  among other factors  and their resulting impact on the estimates and assumptions relating to the value of our long lived assets could result in the need to perform an impairment analysis in future interim periods which could result in a significant impairment 
while we believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  due to their complexity and subjectivity  these estimates and assumptions could vary period to period 
valuation of goodwill 
we assess the impairment of goodwill on an annual basis  in our fourth quarter  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of the reporting unit to which goodwill relates is less than the carrying value 
we consider a synthesis of the following important factors that could trigger an impairment review include the following poor economic performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant negative industry  economic or company specific trends  market and interest rate risk  changes in the manner of our use of the assets or the plans for our business  and loss of key personnel 
in addition  we perform a reconciliation of our market capitalization plus a reasonable control premium to the aggregated implied fair value of all of our reporting units 
if we were to determine that the fair value of a reporting unit was less than its carrying value  including goodwill  based upon the annual test or the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we 
table of contents would measure impairment based on a comparison of the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of a reporting unit to its assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the goodwill of the reporting unit 
to the extent the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill  we would record an impairment charge for the difference 
judgment is required in determining our reporting units and assessing fair value of the reporting units 
the impairment analysis of goodwill is based upon estimates and assumptions relating to our future revenue  cash flows  operating expenses  costs of capital and capital purchases 
these estimates and assumptions are complex and subject to a significant degree of judgment with respect to certain factors including  but not limited to  the cash flows of our long term operating plans  market and interest rate risk  and risk commensurate discount rates and cost of capital 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award s fair value as calculated by the black scholes option pricing model and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period  which is the vesting period 
the black scholes model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including volatility in our common stock price and expected option life 
if any of the assumptions used in the black scholes model change significantly  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from the amounts recorded in our consolidated statement of operations 
we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
noncontrolling interests 
we record noncontrolling interest expense benefit which reflects the portion of the earnings losses of majority owned entities which are applicable to the noncontrolling interest partners in the consolidated statement of operations 
redeemable noncontrolling interests that are redeemable at either fair value or are based on a formula that is intended to approximate fair value follow our historical disclosure only policy for the redemption feature 
redeemable noncontrolling interests that are redeemable at either a fixed price or are based on a formula that is not akin to fair value are reflected as an adjustment to income attributable to common shareholders based on the difference between accretion as calculated using the terms of the redemption feature and the accretion entry for a hypothetical fair value redemption feature with the remaining amount of accretion to redemption value recorded directly to equity 
net loss attributable to the noncontrolling interest in rhapsody is included within the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss 
we applied this accounting policy to the noncontrolling interest in rhapsody that was held by mtvn for periods beginning when rhapsody was formed in august through the quarter ended march  due to the completion of the restructuring of rhapsody on march   which resulted in our holding approximately of the outstanding shares of capital stock of rhapsody  this accounting policy will no longer apply with respect to our investment as we no longer consolidate rhapsody and no longer report a noncontrolling interest 
accounting for gains on sale of subsidiary stock 
effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment to arb no 
sfas which was primarily codified into fasb asc consolidation asc 
current guidance requires the difference between the carrying amount of the parent s investment in a subsidiary and the underlying net book value of the subsidiary after the issuance of stock by the subsidiary to be recorded as equity transactions 
we elected to recognize any such gain in our consolidated statement of operations prior to january  as was allowable under generally accepted accounting principles in place at that time if certain recognition criteria were met 
due to the completion of the restructuring of rhapsody on march   which resulted in our holding approximately of the outstanding shares of capital stock of rhapsody  this accounting policy will no longer apply with respect to our investment as we no longer consolidate rhapsody and no longer report a noncontrolling interest 
accounting for income taxes 
we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year 
in addition  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax 
table of contents consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled 
we must make assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine current provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against deferred tax assets 
our judgments  assumptions  and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
changes in tax law or our interpretation of tax laws and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 
each reporting period we must periodically assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent that recovery is not more likely than not  a valuation allowance must be established 
the establishment of a valuation allowance and increases to such an allowance result in either increases to income tax expense or reduction of income tax benefit in the statement of operations and comprehensive income 
factors we consider in making such an assessment include  but are not limited to  past performance and our expectation of future taxable income  macroeconomic conditions and issues facing our industry  existing contracts  our ability to project future results and any appreciation of our investments and other assets 
we have not provided for us deferred income taxes or withholding taxes on certain non us subsidiaries undistributed earnings 
these earnings are intended to be permanently reinvested in operations outside of the us if these amounts were distributed to the us  in the form of dividends or otherwise  we could be subject to additional us income taxes 
it is not practicable to determine the us federal income tax liability or benefit on such earnings due to the availability of foreign tax credits and the complexity of the computation if such earnings were not deemed to be permanently reinvested 
recently issued accounting standards with the exception of those discussed below  there have been no recent accounting pronouncements or changes in accounting pronouncements during the year ended december   as compared to the recent accounting pronouncements described in our annual report on form k for the year ended december   that are of significance  or potential significance to us 
in september  the fasb ratified accounting standards update asu asu previously emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
asu superseded eitf and addresses criteria for separating the consideration in multiple element arrangements 
asu will require companies to allocate the overall consideration to each deliverable by using a best estimate of the selling price of individual deliverables in the arrangement in the absence of vendor specific objective evidence or other third party evidence of the selling price 
asu was effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  we anticipate no material impact from the adoption of asu on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
in september  the fasb ratified asu asu previously eitf no 
 certain revenue arrangements that include software elements 
asu modifies the scope of software revenue recognition to exclude a non software components of tangible products and b software components of tangible products that are sold  licensed  or leased with tangible products when the software components and non software components of the tangible product function together to deliver the tangible product s essential functionality 
asu was effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  we anticipate no material impact from the adoption of asu on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk involves forward looking statements 
all statements that do not relate to matters of historical fact should be considered forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward looking statements 
interest rate risk 
our exposure to interest rate risk from changes in market interest rates relates primarily to our short term investment portfolio 
we do not hold derivative financial instruments or equity investments in our short term investment portfolio 
our short term investments consist of high quality debt securities as specified in our investment policy 
investments in both fixed and floating rate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
the fair value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
additionally  a declining rate environment creates reinvestment risk because as securities mature the proceeds are reinvested at a lower rate  generating less interest income 
due in part to these factors  our future interest income may be adversely impacted due to changes in interest rates 
in addition  we may incur losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
because we have historically had the ability to hold our short term investments until maturity  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be significantly impacted by a sudden change in market interest rates 
there have been no material changes in our investment methodology regarding our cash equivalents and short term investments during the year ended december  based on our cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  and restricted cash equivalents at december   a hypothetical increase decrease in interest rates would increase decrease our annual interest income and cash flows by approximately million

as of december   we had investments in voting capital stock of both publicly traded and privately held technology companies for business and strategic purposes 
our investments in publicly traded companies are accounted for as available for sale  carried at current market value and are classified as long term as they are strategic in nature 
we periodically evaluate whether any declines in fair value of our investments are other than temporary based on a review of qualitative and quantitative factors 
for investments with publicly quoted market prices  these factors include the time period and extent by which its accounting basis exceeds its quoted market price 
we consider additional factors to determine whether declines in fair value are other than temporary  such as the investee s financial condition  results of operations  and operating trends 
the 
table of contents evaluation also considers publicly available information regarding the investee companies 
for investments in private companies with no quoted market price  we consider similar qualitative and quantitative factors as well as the implied value from any recent rounds of financing completed by the investee 
based upon an evaluation of the facts and circumstances during the years ended december  and  we determined that no additional other than temporary decline in fair value had occurred and therefore no impairment charges were recorded 
we determined that the value of our initial investments in one of our equity method investments  varia llc  was impaired and recorded an impairment of million in the year ended december  foreign currency risk 
we conduct business internationally in several currencies 
as such  we are exposed to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations arise in part from translation of the financial results of foreign subsidiaries into us dollars in consolidation  the remeasurement of non functional currency assets  liabilities and intercompany balances into us dollars for financial reporting purposes  and non us dollar denominated sales to foreign customers 
a portion of these risks is managed through the use of financial derivatives  but fluctuations could impact our results of operations and financial position 
generally  our practice is to manage foreign currency risk for the majority of material short term intercompany balances through the use of foreign currency forward contracts 
these contracts require us to exchange currencies at rates agreed upon at the contract s inception 
because the impact of movements in currency exchange rates on forward contracts offsets the related impact on the short term intercompany balances  these financial instruments help alleviate the risk that might otherwise result from certain changes in currency exchange rates 
we do not designate our foreign exchange forward contracts related to short term intercompany accounts as hedges and  accordingly  we adjust these instruments to fair value through results of operations 
however  we may periodically hedge a portion of our foreign exchange exposures associated with material firmly committed transactions  long term investments  highly predictable anticipated exposures and net investments in foreign subsidiaries 
some of our unhedged exposures are reconciled through our statement of operations on a mark to market basis each quarter  so to the extent we continue to experience adverse economic conditions  we may record losses related to such unhedged exposures in future periods that may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our foreign currency risk management program reduces  but does not entirely eliminate  the impact of currency exchange rate movements 
we have cash balances denominated in foreign currencies which are subject to foreign currency fluctuation risk 
the majority of our foreign currency denominated cash is held in korean won and euros 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in the korean won and euro relative to the us dollar from december  would result in an unrealized gain or loss of approximately million 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses were not material for the years ended december    and
