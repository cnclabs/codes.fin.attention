we meet these customer product needs through focused product research and development efforts as well as through a disciplined acquisition strategy 
our acquisition strategy emphasizes acquiring companies that offer market growth potential as a result of geographic base  technology or industry expansion 
the cash flow needed to fund our growth is developed through continuous  corporate wide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization 
we also prioritize investments that generate higher return on capital businesses 
our management team is compensated based on a modified economic value added eva program which reinforces capital allocation disciplines that drive increases in shareholder value 
the key metrics in our program include total sales growth  organic sales growth  operating margin percent  operating cash flow as a percent of net income and roic 
given the global economic uncertainty  we anticipate that the near term operating environment will remain challenging 
specifically  we are experiencing continued increases in the costs for commodity inputs  including copper  steel and aluminum  which are the primary materials used in manufacturing our products 
we are unable to predict the future costs of these commodities  and continued increases in these costs may adversely affect our operating margins if we are unable to offset cost increases through price  productivity or other means

in addition to operating income  other significant factors affecting our liquidity management include working capital levels  capital expenditures  dividends  acquisitions  availability of debt financing and the ability to attract long term capital at acceptable terms 
our working capital was million at january   an increase of from million at year end at january   our current ratio which is the ratio of our current assets to current liabilities was compared to at january  cash flow provided by operating activities operating cash flow was million for fiscal  a million decrease from fiscal the decrease was driven by a combined increase in the level of accounts receivable  inventory and accounts payable as a result of the increased level of sales

our million revolving credit facility the facility permits us to borrow at interest rates based upon a margin above libor  which margin varies with the ratio of senior funded debt to ebitda as defined in the facility 
these interest rates also vary as libor varies 
we pay a commitment fee on the unused amount of the facility  which also varies with the ratio of our senior funded debt to our ebitda 
as of january   we had approximately million in standby letters of credit issued under the facility and million in available borrowings under the facility 
the average balance outstanding in direct borrowings under the facility in fiscal was million 
the facility matures in april on june   we entered into a term loan agreement term loan with certain financial institutions  pursuant to which we borrowed an aggregate principal amount of million 
the term loan matures in june  and borrowings generally bear interest at a variable rate equal to a margin over libor which varies with the ratio of our consolidated debt to consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization ebitda as defined in the agreement 
these interest rates also vary as libor varies 
at january   the interest rate of was based on a margin over libor 
the notes  the term loan and the facility require us to meet specified financial ratios and to satisfy certain financial condition tests

at january   net of interest rate swaps  we had million of fixed rate debt and million of variable rate debt 
the variable rate debt is primarily under our term loan with an interest rate based on a margin above libor 
as a result  interest rate changes impact future earnings and cash flow assuming other factors are constant 
a hypothetical change in our weighted average borrowing rate on outstanding variable rate debt at january  would result in a change in net income of approximately million 
predominately  all of our expenses are paid in cash  often with payment term provisions that include early payment discounts and time elements 
we believe that our ability to generate positive cash flow  coupled with our available revolver balance will be sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable future 
we focus on optimizing our investment in working capital through improved and enforced payment terms and operational efficiencies 
additionally  we believe that our capital expenditures for maintenance of equipment and facilities will be consistent with prior levels and not present a funding challenge 
we were in compliance with all of our financial covenants at the end of fiscal we believe that we will continue to be in compliance with these covenants for the foreseeable future 
the primary financial covenants on our notes  term loan  and the facility include ratios of debt to ebitda as defined in each agreement and minimum interest coverage ratios of ebitda to interest expense 
the debt to ebitda covenant ratio requires us to be less than  and our ratio at january  was approximately the minimum interest coverage ratio requires us to be greater than  and our ratio at january  was approximately we will  from time to time  maintain excess cash balances which may be used to fund operations  repay outstanding debt and will be available for other investments which may include acquisitions of businesses or product lines  dividends  investments in new product development programs and the repurchase of our commons stock 
our projections are based on all information known to us  which may change based on global economic events  our financial performance  actions by our customers and competitors and other factors discussed in risk factors

litigation in july  we filed a response and counterclaims in an action initiated by nordyne  inc nordyne on february   in the us district court for the eastern district of missouri 
in the action  nordyne is seeking a judgment declaring that neither nordyne s g furnace systems nor its iq drive seer air conditioning systems infringe on our ecm electronically commutated motor systems patent us patent no 
 the patent and or that the patent is invalid 
in our response and counterclaims against nordyne  we deny that nordyne is entitled to relief and we seek a judgment that nordyne has  in fact  infringed and continues to infringe the patent by making  using  offering for sale and selling it g furnace systems and iq drive seer air conditioning systems 
we also have requested the us district court to enjoin nordyne and all persons working in concert with nordyne from further infringement of the patent and to award us compensatory and other damages caused by such infringement 
on february   the court issued a claim construction order in which it held that some of the claims in the patent contain limitations that are indefinite and thus invalid 
however  other claims of the patent were not affected by this ruling and remain to be litigated in the action 
we intend to defend our intellectual property vigorously against the claims asserted by nordyne and against any infringement by nordyne or any other person 
we do not currently believe that the litigation will have a material effect on the company s financial position or its results of operations

these claims generally allege that the ventilation units were the cause of fires 
based on the current facts  we do not believe these claims  individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
however  we cannot predict the outcome of these claims  the nature or extent of remedial actions  if any  we may need to undertake with respect to motors that remain in the field  or the costs we many incur  some of which could be significant 
we are  from time to time  party to other litigation that arises in the normal course of our business operations  including product warranty and liability claims  contract disputes and environmental  asbestos  employment and other litigation matters 
our products are used in a variety of industrial  commercial and residential applications that subject us to claims that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in injury or other damage 
we accrue for anticipated costs in defending against such lawsuits in amounts that we believe are adequate  and we do not believe that the outcome of any such lawsuit will have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position

critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies could have the most significant effect on our reported results 
goodwill we evaluate the carrying amount of goodwill annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired 
when applying the accounting guidance  we use estimates to determine when it might be necessary to take an impairment charge 
factors that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or forecasted operating results  a significant decrease in the market value of an asset or significant negative industry or economic trends 
we perform our required annual goodwill impairment test as of the end of the october fiscal month each year 
the key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model used to estimate fair value include discount rates  growth rates  cash flow projections and terminal value rates 
discount rates  growth rates and cash flow projections are the most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant management judgment 
discount rates are determined by using a weighted average cost of capital wacc 
the wacc considers market and industry data as well as company specific risk factors for each reporting unit in determining the appropriate discount rate to be used 
the discount rate utilized for each reporting unit is indicative of the return an investor would expect to receive for investing in such a business 
terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual cash flow estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant wacc and long term growth rates 
the calculated fair values for our impairment testing exceed the carrying values of the reporting units 
the two reporting units that compromise approximately of the total consolidated carrying value at january  had a combined excess of approximately estimated fair value over carrying value 
we had two reporting units with a total of million of goodwill at january  that had an estimated fair value that was less than over carrying value 
page 
table of contents intangible assets we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable through future cash flows 
when applying the accounting guidance we use estimates to determine when an impairment is necessary 
factors that could trigger an impairment review include a significant decrease in the market value of an asset or significant negative or economic trends 
see also note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
derivatives we periodically enter into commodity hedging transactions to reduce the impact of changing prices for certain commodities such as copper and aluminum based upon forecasted purchases of such commodities 
we also use a cash hedging strategy to protect against an increase in the cost of forecasted foreign currency denominated transactions 
finally  we also have certain libor based floating rate borrowings that expose us to variability in interest rates that have been swapped into a pay fixed receive libor based interest rate swap agreement 
the fair value of derivatives is recorded on the consolidated balance sheet and the value is determined based on level inputs 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
retirement plans approximately half of our domestic employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans with the remaining employees covered by defined contribution plans 
the defined benefit pension plans covering a majority of our domestic employees were frozen to new employees as of january  most of our foreign employees are covered by government sponsored plans in the countries in which they are employed 
our obligations under our defined benefit pension plans are determined with the assistance of actuarial firms 
the actuaries make certain assumptions regarding such factors as withdrawal rates and mortality rates 
the actuaries also provide information and recommendations from which management makes further assumptions on such factors as the long term expected rate of return on plan assets  the discount rate on benefit obligations and where applicable  the rate of annual compensation increases 
based upon the assumptions made  the investments made by the plans  overall conditions and movement in financial markets  particularly the stock market and how actual withdrawal rates  life spans of benefit recipients and other factors differ from assumptions  annual expenses and recorded assets or liabilities of these defined benefit pension plans may change significantly from year to year 
based on the annual review of actuarial assumptions as well as historical rates of return on plan assets and existing long term bond rates  we set the long term rate of return on plan assets at and used a discount rate ranging from to for its defined benefit pension plans as of january  see also note of the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes we operate in numerous taxing jurisdictions and are subject to regular examinations by various us federal  state and foreign jurisdictions for various tax periods 
our income tax positions are based on research and interpretations of the income tax laws and rulings in each of the jurisdictions in which we do business 
due to the subjectivity of interpretations of laws and rulings in each jurisdiction  the differences and interplay in tax laws between those jurisdictions as well as the inherent uncertainty in estimating the final resolution of complex tax audit matters  our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments 
additional information regarding income taxes is contained in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements

we manage the exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating and financing activities and derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps  commodity cash flow hedges and foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
all hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to clearly defined polices and procedures  which strictly prohibit the use of financial instruments for speculative purposes 
all hedges are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value and are accounted for as cash flow hedges  with changes in fair value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss aoci in each accounting period

foreign currency risk we are also exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations 
these risks include the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries  intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries and transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
our objective is to minimize our exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating activities and the utilization of foreign currency exchange contracts to manage our exposure on the transactions denominated in currencies other than the applicable functional currency 
contracts are executed with creditworthy banks and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries 
we do not hedge our exposure to the translation of reported results of foreign subsidiaries from local currency to united states dollars
