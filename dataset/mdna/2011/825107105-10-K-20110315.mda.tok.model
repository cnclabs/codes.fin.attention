performance overview the company recorded a net loss of million in  compared to net income of million and million for and  respectively 
the basic and diluted loss per common share for was  compared to basic and diluted earnings per common share of for and for for  the main contributors to the net loss were goodwill impairment charges and a higher provision for credit losses when compared to the prior two years 
during the third quarter of  the company recorded goodwill impairment charges of million and other intangible assets impairment charges of thousand 
the provision for credit losses for  and was million  million and million  respectively 
during  the ongoing economic recession created more credit quality issues that resulted in higher loan charge offs and a higher provision for credit losses than in and during  net income available to common stockholders was negatively impacted by dividends and discount accretion associated with the sale and subsequent redemption of the company s series a preferred stock issued to the treasury under the tarp capital purchase plan the cpp 
the impact on earnings from the preferred stock activity was million 
return on average assets was for  compared to for and for return on average stockholders equity for was  compared to for and for comparing the year ended december  to the year ended december   average assets increased slightly to billion  average loans decreased slightly to million  average deposits increased to million  and average stockholders equity decreased to million 
comparing to  average assets increased  average loans increased  average deposits increased  and average stockholders equity increased 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and follow general practices within the industries in which it operates 
application of these principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions  and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
estimates  assumptions  and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value  when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write down or valuation reserve to be established  or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third party sources  when available 
the most significant accounting policies that the company follows are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this discussion  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying those amounts  management has determined that the accounting policy with respect to the allowance for credit losses to be the accounting area that requires the most subjective or complex judgments  and  as such  could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
accordingly  the allowance for credit losses is considered to be a critical accounting policy  along with goodwill and other intangible assets and fair value  as discussed below 
the allowance for credit losses represents management s estimate of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the consolidated balance sheets 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the methodology used to determine the allowance for credit losses and a discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the allowance for credit losses is included in the provision for credit losses and risk management section of this discussion 
goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
other intangible assets represent purchased assets that also lack physical substance but can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual or other legal rights or because the asset is capable of being sold or exchanged either on its own or in combination with a related contract  asset or liability 
goodwill and other intangible assets are required to be recorded at fair value 
determining fair value is subjective  requiring the use of estimates  assumptions and management judgment 
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested at least annually for impairment  usually during the third quarter  or on an interim basis if circumstances dictate 
intangible assets that have finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and also are subject to impairment testing 
impairment testing requires that the fair value of each of the company s reporting units be compared to the carrying amount of its net assets  including goodwill 
the company s reporting units were identified based on an analysis of each of its individual operating segments 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than book value  an expense may be required to write down the related goodwill or purchased intangibles to record an impairment loss 
the company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value  with the measurements made on a recurring or nonrecurring basis 
significant financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis are investment securities and interest rate caps 
impaired loans and other real estate and other assets owned are significant financial instruments measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis 
fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
in determining fair value  the company is required to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs  reducing subjectivity 
recent accounting pronouncements and developments the financial accounting standards board s fasb accounting standards codification became effective on july  at that date  the codification became fasb s officially recognized source of authoritative us generally accepted accounting principles gaap applicable to all public and non public non governmental entities  superseding existing fasb  american institute of certified public accountants aicpa  emerging issues task force eitf and related literature 
rules and interpretive releases of the sec under the authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
all other accounting literature is considered non authoritative 
the switch to the codification affects the way companies refer to us gaap in financial statements and accounting policies 
citing particular content in the codification involves specifying the unique numeric path to the content through the topic  subtopic  section and paragraph structure 
note to the consolidated financial statements discusses new accounting policies that the company adopted during and the expected impact of accounting policies recently issued or proposed but not yet required to be adopted 
to the extent the adoption of new accounting standards materially affects our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity  the impacts are discussed in the applicable section s of this discussion and notes to the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations net interest income and net interest margin during and  the frb made no changes to the fed funds rate  unlike in when the frb reduced the fed funds rate by basis points 
the new york prime rate  the primary index used for variable rate loans  also remained unchanged during and but declined basis points during reflecting the continuing lower interest rate environment  our overall yields earned and rates paid during decreased when compared to and net interest income remains the most significant component of our earnings 
it is the excess of interest and fees earned on total earning assets loans  investment securities  federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits with other banks over interest owed on interest bearing liabilities deposits and borrowings 
as shown in the table below  tax equivalent net interest income for was million  a increase over the increase was primarily due to lower rates paid on interest bearing liabilities offsetting the decline in yields on earning assets 
tax equivalent net interest income for was million  a increase over during  the increase in the volume of earning assets and lower rates paid on interest bearing liabilities were sufficient to offset the decline in yields on earning assets 
our net interest margin ie  tax equivalent net interest income divided by average earning assets represents the net yield on earning assets 
the net interest margin is managed through loan and deposit pricing and asset liability strategies and in  the net interest margin benefited from the company s effort to reduce deposit pricing structures 
the net interest margin was for  compared to for and for the increase in net interest income was enough to improve the net interest margin basis points in when compared to which was not the case in because the net interest margin declined basis points when compared to the net interest spread  which is the difference between the average yield on earning assets and the rate paid for interest bearing liabilities  was for  for and for the following table sets forth the major components of net interest income  on a tax equivalent basis  for the years ended december    and average interest yield average interest yield average interest yield dollars in thousands balance rate balance rate balance rate earning assets loans investment securities taxable tax exempt federal funds sold interest bearing deposits total earning assets cash and due from banks other assets allowance for credit losses total assets interest bearing liabilities demand deposits money market and savings deposits certificates of deposit   or more other time deposits interest bearing deposits short term borrowings long term debt total interest bearing liabilities noninterest bearing deposits other liabilities stockholders equity total liabilities and stockholders equity net interest spread net interest margin all amounts are reported on a tax equivalent basis computed using the statutory federal income tax rate of for  for and for  exclusive of the alternative minimum tax rate and nondeductible interest expense

the tax equivalent yield on loans decreased to for  compared to for and for the decrease of million in average loans and the decrease of basis points in the yield on loans was the primary reason for the decline in interest income in interest income in also declined when compared to because the million increase in average loans during was not enough to offset the decrease of basis points in the yield on loans for that year 
the changes in all other average earning assets included increases in taxable investment securities and interest bearing deposits with other banks of million and million  respectively  when compared to and decreases in federal funds sold and tax exempt investment securities of million and million  respectively  when compared to for  average federal funds sold increased while average investment securities and interest bearing deposits with other banks decreased

the yields on all other earning assets decreased in when compared to yields in when comparing to  the overall decrease in yields on earning assets produced million less in interest income  almost all of which was due to lower rates  as seen in the rate volume variance analysis below

noninterest income noninterest income decreased million  or  in  compared to a decrease of thousand  or  in the decrease in noninterest income in when compared to was mainly due to a decline in insurance agency commissions of million  a decline in mortgage broker fees of thousand and a mark to market gain of thousand on interest rate swaps in the decline in insurance agency commissions reflected the continuing soft market in the insurance industry 
mortgage broker fees declined because the company terminated the operations of its mortgage subsidiary during and now conducts brokerage activities through a minority series investment in an unrelated delaware limited liability company under the name wye mortgage group 
during  wye mortgage group generated a thousand loss which was reported in other noninterest income 
the decrease in noninterest income was partially offset by increases in trust and investment fee income and other noninterest income of thousand and thousand  respectively 
other noninterest income included a thousand gain relating to the surrender of directors life insurance policies 
a decline in insurance agency commissions of thousand and net gains on asset sales of thousand in accounted for most of the decrease in when compared to this decrease was partially offset by an increase of thousand in other noninterest income 
the net gains in included a million gain on the sale of a bank branch  offset by a combined thousand other than temporary impairment and subsequent loss on the sale of freddie mac preferred stock and a thousand loss on the sale of the company s investment in delmarva bank data processing center  inc  an unconsolidated subsidiary

the company recorded goodwill impairment charges of million at felton bank and goodwill impairment charges of million and other intangible assets impairment charges of thousand at tsgia 
other noninterest expenses for increased thousand when compared to  over half of which included expenses related to collection and other real estate owned activities 
partially offsetting these increases in expense were a decrease in salaries and wages of million and a decrease in employee benefits of thousand reflecting lower expenses accrued for bonus and profit sharing plans which are a part of overall cost containment measures taken by the company 
insurance agency commissions expense and fdic insurance premium expense decreased thousand and thousand  respectively 
a significant portion of the increase in was due to increased fdic insurance premium expense of million when compared to the increase in fdic insurance premiums was attributable to higher overall rates  a one time special assessment of thousand and growth in our deposits 
other noninterest expenses for increased thousand when compared to  over half of which included expenses related to collection and other real estate owned activities 
occupancy expense increased thousand mainly due to one additional bank branch and usual annual rent increases 
partially offsetting these increases in expense were lower insurance agency commissions expense of thousand and lower employee benefits expense of thousand 
employee benefits declined from amounts primarily due to less expense accrued for the company s profit sharing plan contribution for amortization of intangible assets relates to felton bank and the insurance subsidiaries

capital management total stockholders equity for the company was million at december   lower than in the previous year 
stockholders equity at december  increased slightly over december  the decrease in stockholders equity in was due primarily to the million loss and million in dividends paid on shares of the common stock of the company

provision for credit losses and risk management originating loans involves a degree of risk that credit losses will occur in varying amounts according to  among other factors  the types of loans being made  the credit worthiness of the borrowers over the term of the loans  the quality of the collateral for the loan  if any  as well as general economic conditions 
the company s board of directors demands accountability of management  keeping the interests of shareholders in focus 
through the banks asset liability management committees and the company s audit committee  the board actively reviews critical risk positions  including credit  market  liquidity and operational risk 
the company s goal in managing risk is to reduce earnings volatility  control exposure to unnecessary risk  and ensure appropriate returns for risk assumed 
senior members of management actively manage risk at the product level  supplemented with corporate level oversight through the asset liability management committee and internal audit function 
the risk management structure is designed to identify risk issues through a systematic process  enabling timely and appropriate action to avoid and mitigate risk 
credit risk is mitigated through loan portfolio diversification  limiting exposure to any single industry or customer  collateral protection and standard lending policies and underwriting criteria 
the following discussion provides information and statistics on the overall quality of the company s loan portfolio 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the accounting policies related to nonperforming loans loans on nonaccrual or delinquent days or more and troubled debt restructurings and charge offs and describes the methodologies used to develop the allowance for credit losses  including the specific  formula and nonspecific components also discussed below 
management believes the policies governing nonperforming loans and charge offs are consistent with regulatory standards 
the amount of the allowance for credit losses and the resulting provision are reviewed monthly by senior members of management and approved quarterly by the board of directors 
the allowance is increased by provisions for credit losses charged to expense and recoveries of loans previously charged off 
it is decreased by loans charged off in the current period 
loans  or portions thereof  are charged off when considered uncollectible 
provisions for credit losses are made to bring the allowance for credit losses within the range of balances that are considered appropriate based upon the allowance methodology and to reflect losses within the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is determined based on management s estimate of the inherent risks associated with lending activities  estimated fair value of collateral  past experience and present indicators such as loan delinquency trends  nonaccrual loans and current market conditions 
management believes the allowance is adequate  however  future changes in the composition of the loan portfolio and financial condition of borrowers may result in additions to the allowance 
examination of the portfolio and allowance by various regulatory agencies and consultants engaged by the company may result in the need for additional provisions based upon information available at the time of the examination 
each of the banks maintains a separate allowance for credit losses  which is only available to absorb losses from their respective loan portfolios 
the allowance set by each of the banks is subject to regulatory examination and determination as to its adequacy 
the allowance for credit losses is comprised of three parts the specific allowance  the formula allowance and the nonspecific allowance 
the specific allowance is established against impaired loans until charge offs are made 
the formula allowance is determined based on management s assessment of industry trends and economic factors in the markets in which we operate 
the determination of the formula allowance involves a higher risk of uncertainty and considers current risk factors that may not have yet manifested themselves in our historical loss factors 
the nonspecific allowance captures losses that have impacted the portfolio but have yet to be recognized in either the specific or formula allowance 
the specific allowance is used to individually allocate an allowance to loans identified as impaired 
an impaired loan may show deficiencies in the borrower s overall financial condition  payment history  support available from financial guarantors and or the fair market value of collateral 
if it is determined that there is a loss associated with an impaired loan  a specific allowance is established until a charge off is made 
impaired loans  or portions thereof  are charged off when deemed uncollectible 
the formula allowance is used to estimate the loss on internally risk rated loans  exclusive of those identified as impaired 
loans that are identified as special mention  substandard and doubtful are adversely rated 
these loans are assigned higher allowance factors than favorably rated loans due to management s concerns regarding collectability or management s knowledge of particular elements regarding the borrower 
loans that are favorably rated are grouped by type commercial real estate and construction  residential real estate  commercial or consumer 
each loan type is assigned an allowance factor based on management s estimate of the risk  complexity and size of individual loans within a particular category 
the nonspecific allowance is used to estimate the loss on loans stemming from more global factors such as delinquencies  loss history  trends in volume and terms of loans  effects of changes in lending policy  the experience and depth of management  national and local economic trends  concentrations of credit  the quality of the loan review system and the effect of external factors such as competition and regulatory requirements 
the economic recession began to materially impact our performance in the second half of and throughout because most of our loans are secured by real estate  our credit quality issues grew as property values and real estate sales declined in our market 
these credit quality issues have resulted in higher provisions for credit losses  loan charge offs and nonperforming assets 
at december   the allowance for credit losses was million  or of average outstanding loans and of total nonaccrual loans 
this compares to an allowance of million  or of average outstanding loans and of nonaccrual loans  at december   and an allowance of million  or of average outstanding loans and of nonaccrual loans  at december  the ratio of net charge offs to average loans was in  in and in the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of nonaccrual loans has declined in each of the last three years as a result of the increased volume of nonaccrual loans 
the majority of the company s nonaccrual loans are real estate secured and at the time the loan is determined to be impaired the uncollectible portion is charged off 
at december   nonaccrual loans were reduced by partial charge offs totaling million  or  of the unpaid principal balance 
the provision for credit losses was million for  compared to million and million for and  respectively 
net loan charge offs totaled million in  million in and million in construction loans had the largest amount of charge offs in these losses primarily related to two significant construction loan relationships described below in the discussion relating to nonaccrual loans 
as management identifies problem loans  losses are quantified and minimized  and loan workouts are pursued concluding in either mutually acceptable resolutions or disposal of the problem loans 
the following table sets forth a summary of our loan loss experience for the years ended december dollars in thousands balance  beginning of year loans charged off real estate construction real estate residential real estate commercial commercial consumer total recoveries real estate construction real estate residential real estate commercial commercial consumer total net loans charged off provision for credit losses balance  end of year average loans outstanding percentage of net charge offs to average loans outstanding during the year percentage of allowance for credit losses at year end to average loans during  there was no change in the methods or assumptions affecting the allowance methodology 
the amount of the provision is determined based on management s analysis of the portfolio  growth and changes in the condition of credits and their resultant specific loss allocations 
historically  we have experienced the majority of our losses in the commercial loan portfolio  which are typically not secured by real estate 
however  beginning in  the company experienced significantly higher losses on real estate secured loans due to declining real estate values and the economic recession 
as seen in the table below  the unallocated portion of the allowance for credit losses was a fairly small percent of the total allowance with thousand at december   thousand at december  and thousand at december  as stated previously  most of our loans are secured by real estate with the portfolio comprised of construction  residential real estate and commercial real estate at december  that compares to  and  respectively  at december  and  and  respectively  at december  the following table sets forth the allocation of the allowance for credit losses and the percentage of loans in each category to total loans for the years ended december of of of of of dollars in thousands amount loans amount loans amount loans amount loans amount loans real estate construction real estate residential real estate commercial commercial consumer unallocated total nonaccrual loans and loans days past due and still accruing at december   and were primarily real estate loans 
total nonaccrual loans increased to of total loans at december   compared to at december  and at december  the increase in nonaccrual loans during was primarily in real estate loans  specifically in construction loans that related largely to two borrowing relationships 
the company has a million participation with a regional bank that is matured 
through december   the customer made all interest payments 
during  this loan migrated from days past due to nonaccrual and thousand was subsequently charged off 
also during  a second significant construction loan relationship totaling approximately million was put on nonaccrual and million was subsequently charged off 
loans days past due and still accruing were million  million and million at year end  and  respectively 
at the end of  nonaccrual loans and loans days past due and still accruing included troubled debt restructurings of million and thousand  respectively 
management believes nonaccrual loans and loans days past due and still accruing have been adequately provided for in the allowance for credit losses

our principal market risk is interest rate risk that arises from our lending  investing and deposit taking activities 
our profitability is largely dependent on the banks net interest income 
interest rate risk can significantly affect net interest income to the degree that interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice at different intervals than interest earning assets 
the banks asset liability management committees oversee the management of interest rate risk 
the primary purpose of these committees is to manage the exposure of net interest margins to unexpected changes due to interest rate fluctuations 
these efforts affect our loan pricing and deposit rate policies as well as asset mix  volume guidelines  and liquidity and capital planning 
during  the company began using derivative instruments to hedge its exposure to changes in interest rates 
the company does not use derivatives for any trading or other speculative purposes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on hedging activities 
because we are not exposed to market risk from trading activities and do not utilize off balance sheet management strategies  the asset liability management committees of the banks rely on gap analysis as its primary tool in managing interest rate risk 
gap analysis summarizes the amount of interest sensitive assets and liabilities  which will reprice over various time intervals 
the excess between the volume of assets and liabilities repricing in each interval is the interest sensitivity gap 
positive gap occurs when more assets reprice in a given time interval  while negative gap occurs when more liabilities reprice 
as of december   we had an overall negative gap position within the one year repricing interval because the interest sensitive liabilities exceeded the interest sensitive assets within the one year repricing interval by million  or of total assets 
the negative gap position within the one year interval at december  totaled million  or of total assets 
the million decrease in the one year negative gap for when compared to was primarily due to fewer time deposits in the one year interval gap at the end of than at the end of the negative gap position within the one year interval at december   totaled million  or of total assets 
the following table summarizes our interest sensitivity at december  loans  federal funds sold  time deposits and short term borrowings are classified based on contractual maturities if fixed rate or earliest repricing date if variable rate 
investment securities are classified by contractual maturities or  if they have call provisions  by the most likely repricing date

the model takes into consideration the effect of call features of investment securities as well as prepayments of loans in periods of declining rates 
when actual changes in interest rates occur  the changes in interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities may differ from the assumptions used in the model 
the chart below provides the sensitivity profiles for net interest income and the fair value of capital as of year end and as of december  and  due to the low interest rate environment  we believe the results of the minus basis point change in rates are not meaningful

these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
the banks exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to these financial instruments is represented by the contractual amount of the instruments 
the banks use the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as they use for on balance sheet instruments 
the banks generally require collateral or other security to support the financial instruments with credit risk 
the amount of collateral or other security is determined based on management s credit evaluation of the counterparty 
the banks evaluate each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the banks to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
letters of credit and other commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
because many of the letters of credit and commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
further information about these arrangements is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
management does not believe that any of the foregoing arrangements have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 
liquidity management liquidity describes our ability to meet financial obligations that arise during the normal course of business 
liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of customers and to fund current and planned expenditures 
liquidity is derived through increased customer deposits  maturities in the investment portfolio  loan repayments and income from earning assets 
to the extent that deposits are not adequate to fund customer loan demand  liquidity needs can be met in the short term funds markets 
we have arrangements with correspondent banks whereby we have million available in federal funds lines of credit and a reverse repurchase agreement available to meet any short term needs which may not otherwise be funded by the banks portfolio of readily marketable investments that can be converted to cash 
the banks are also members of the federal home loan bank  which provides another source of liquidity 
at december   the banks had credit availability of approximately million from the federal home loan bank 
during  through a commercial bank the company obtained a million line of credit which expired in november of at december   our loan to deposit ratio was approximately  a more liquid position than the and at year end and  respectively 
during  we began participating in the ind program which increased liquidity 
investment securities available for sale totaling million at the end of were available for the management of liquidity and interest rate risk 
the comparable amounts were million and million at december  and  respectively 
cash and cash equivalents were million at december   compared to million at year end and million at year end overall  the company s liquidity position at the end of was similar to that at the end of  with both years ending in a more liquid position than at the end of management is not aware of any demands  commitments  events or uncertainties that will materially affect our ability to maintain liquidity at satisfactory levels 
we have various financial obligations  including contractual obligations and commitments that may require future cash payments
