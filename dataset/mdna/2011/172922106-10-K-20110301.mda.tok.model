earnings overview for the year ended december   net income available to common shareholders was reported of  or per share basic and diluted 
the corporation reported a net loss of  per share basic and diluted in  while net income was  per share basic and diluted in the net loss for the year ended december  included the impact of after tax other than temporary impairment otti charges on available for sale securities adjusted for realized gains on some securities subsequently sold of  in  the after tax impact of otti charges was  core earnings is an earnings performance measurement which the corporation s management has defined to exclude the effects of otti losses on available for sale securities and realized gains on securities for which otti has previously been recognized 
core earnings is a performance measurement that is not based on us generally accepted accounting principles 
management believes core earnings information is meaningful for evaluating the corporation s operating performance  because it excludes some of the impact of market volatility as it relates to investments in pooled trust preferred securities and other securities 
more information concerning core earnings  including a reconciliation to the corporation s earnings results based on us generally accepted accounting principles  is provided in the following section of management s discussion and analysis 
core earnings available to common shareholders were  for or per diluted share 
the corporation s results for included positive core earnings available to common shareholders of  per diluted share  reduced by after tax otti charges on available for sale securities net of subsequent gains from selling some of the securities of  in  the corporation had core earnings of  per diluted share 
core earnings per share in have been impacted by a higher number of weighted average common shares outstanding than in the previous two years  resulting from the issuance of common shares in a public offering in december pre tax otti charges totaled  in compared with  in and  in management evaluates securities for otti at least on a quarterly basis  and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such evaluation 
the corporation s process for evaluating all available for sale securities for otti is described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
as described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  the corporation adopted new accounting principles in  which resulted in the impairment of debt securities being separated into a the amount of the total impairment related to credit loss  which is recognized in the income statement  and b the amount of the total impairment related to all other factors  which is recognized in other comprehensive income 
in  the effect of the new principles was to increase impairment losses recognized in earnings by  and decrease the income tax provision by  resulting in a decrease in net income larger net loss of  or per average common share 
statement regarding non gaap financial measurement this report contains supplemental financial information determined by a method other than in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
management uses this non gaap measure in its analysis of the corporation s performance 
this measure  core earnings  excludes the effects of otti losses on available for sale securities and realized gains on securities for which otti has previously been recognized 
management believes the presentation of this financial measure  which excludes the impact of the specified items  provides useful supplemental information that is essential to a proper understanding of the financial results of the corporation 
the core earnings measure provides a method to assess operating performance excluding the impact of market volatility related to investments in pooled trust preferred securities and other securities 
this disclosure should not be viewed as a substitute for results determined in accordance with gaap  nor is it necessarily comparable to non gaap performance measures that may be presented by other companies

the provision for loan losses was  up from  in in  management increased the estimated allowance for loan losses related to individually impaired loans 
non interest revenue for was  or  higher than in  reflecting substantial increases for in revenue from sales of mortgages  as well as from debit card related interchange fees 
non interest expense was  or  lower than in the decrease reflects the impact of lower fdic assessments  lower furniture and equipment expense primarily associated with much of the core banking system software and equipment becoming fully depreciated  as well as reductions in several other categories of operating costs 
the provision for income taxes for was  or of pre tax income 
in  the corporation recorded a credit provision for income taxes based on an effective tax rate of 
fluctuations in the tax provision pre tax income rate for these periods include the impact of changes in the average holdings of tax exempt securities and loans 
also  the provision includes the reversal of a valuation allowance established in on certain deferred tax assets 
vs 
the most significant changes in components of the corporation core earnings results for  as compared to  were as follows net interest income increased  or 
on a fully taxable equivalent basis  net interest income increased  or 
the interest margin has been positively impacted by lower short term market interest rates  which have reduced interest rates paid on deposits and borrowings 
the interest margin has also been positively impacted by increased levels of investments and high yields on municipal bonds 
the interest margin has been negatively impacted by weak consumer loan demand  as average loans outstanding shrunk approximately million in as compared to the provision for loan losses was  lower in than in the ratio of nonperforming loans including nonaccrual loans and loans days or more past due and still accruing interest and other real estate owned  as a percentage of assets  was at december   higher than the level at december   but still relatively low by historical standards 
non interest income decreased  or 
in  non interest income included a gain of  from redemption of restricted shares of visa  resulting from visa s initial public offering 
also  in  the corporation received no dividend income on its investment in restricted stock issued by the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh  while dividend income on this stock was  in non interest expense increased  or 
fdic insurance assessments increased  in  to  from  the higher fdic assessments included the effects of premium increases and a special assessment of  excluding fdic costs  total non interest expense was lower in than in core earnings for were reduced by dividends on preferred stock issued to the us treasury under the tarp capital purchase program of more detailed information concerning fluctuations in the corporation s earnings results are provided in other sections of management s discussion and analysis 
critical accounting policies the presentation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect many of the reported amounts and disclosures 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
a material estimate that is particularly susceptible to significant change is the determination of the allowance for loan losses 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate and reasonable 
the corporation s methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses is described in a separate section later in management s discussion and analysis 
given the very subjective nature of identifying and valuing loan losses  it is likely that well informed individuals could make materially different assumptions  and could  therefore calculate a materially different allowance value 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  changes in economic conditions may necessitate revisions in future years 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the corporation s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the corporation to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of their examination 
another material estimate is the calculation of fair values of the corporation s debt securities 
for most of the corporation s debt securities  the corporation receives estimated fair values of debt securities from an independent valuation service  or from brokers 
in developing fair values  the valuation service and the brokers use estimates of cash flows  based on historical performance of similar instruments in similar interest rate environments 
based on experience  management is aware that estimated fair values of debt securities tend to vary among brokers and other valuation services 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  management calculates the fair values of pooled trust preferred securities by applying discount rates to estimated cash flows for each security 
management estimated the cash flows expected to be received from each security  taking into account estimated levels of deferrals and defaults by the underlying issuers  and used discount rates considered reflective of a market participant s expectations regarding the extent of credit and liquidity risk inherent in the securities 
management s estimates of cash flows and discount rates used to calculate fair values of pooled trust preferred securities were based on sensitive assumptions  and use of different assumptions could result in calculations of fair values that would be substantially different than the amounts calculated by management 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  management evaluates securities for otti 
in making that evaluation  consideration is given to the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and whether the corporation intends to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery 
management s assessments of the likelihood and potential for recovery in value of securities are subjective and based on sensitive assumptions 
also  management s estimates of cash flows used to evaluate otti of pooled trust preferred securities are based on sensitive assumptions  and use of different assumptions could produce different conclusions for each security 
net interest income the corporation s primary source of operating income is net interest income  which is equal to the difference between the amounts of interest income and interest expense 
tables i  ii and iii include information regarding the corporation s net interest income in   and in each of these tables  the amounts of interest income earned on tax exempt securities and loans have been adjusted to a fully taxable equivalent basis 
accordingly  the net interest income amounts reflected in these tables exceed the amounts presented in the consolidated financial statements 
the discussion that follows is based on amounts in the tables 
vs 
fully taxable equivalent net interest income was  in   lower than in as shown in table iii  net changes in volume had the effect of increasing net interest income  in compared to  and interest rate changes had the effect of decreasing net interest income  the most significant components of the volume change in net interest income in were a decrease in interest income of  attributable to a reduction in the balance of taxable available for sale securities and a decrease in interest expense of  attributable to a reduction in the balance of long term borrowed funds 
the most significant components of the rate change in net interest income in were a decrease in interest income of  attributable to lower rates earned on taxable available for sale securities and a decrease in interest expense of  due to lower rates paid on interest bearing deposits 
as presented in table ii  the interest rate spread excess of average rate of return on earning assets over average cost of funds on interest bearing liabilities was in  as compared to in interest income and earning assets interest income totaled  in  a decrease of from income from available for sale securities decreased   while interest and fees from loans decreased  or 
as indicated in table ii  total average available for sale securities at amortized cost in decreased to  a decrease of  or from during and  the corporation increased the size of its tax exempt municipal security portfolio  while shrinking the average taxable available for sale securities portfolio 
the corporation s yield on taxable securities fell in and primarily because of low market interest rates  including the effects of management s decision to limit purchases of taxable securities to investments that mature or are expected to repay a substantial portion of principal within approximately four years or less 
in addition to the impact of falling rates  the corporation s yield on taxable securities was also negatively affected in by higher than expected prepayments on mortgage backed securities  these prepayments were caused by procedural changes by the us government agencies that issued the securities 
the average rate of return on available for sale securities was for and in the average balance of gross loans decreased to  in from  in due to the challenging economic environment and the corporation s decision to sell a portion of its newly originated residential mortgages on the secondary market  the corporation experienced contraction in the balance of its mortgage and consumer loan portfolios  with modest growth in average commercial loan balances 
the corporation s yield on loans fell as rates on new loans as well as existing  variable rate loans have decreased 
the average rate of return on loans was in and in the average balance of interest bearing due from banks increased to  in from  in in the last half of and all of  this consisted primarily of balances held by the federal reserve 
in early  more overnight funds were invested in federal funds sold to other banks  which decreased to an average balance of  in from  in although the rates of return on balances with the federal reserve are low  the corporation maintained relatively high levels of liquid assets in and as opposed to increasing long term  available for sale securities at higher yields in order to maximize flexibility for dealing with possible fluctuations in cash requirements  and due to management s concern about the possibility of substantial increases in interest rates within the next few years 
also  in  management maintained a portion of the balance with the federal reserve in anticipation of repurchasing the tarp preferred stock and warrant

service charges on deposit accounts decreased  or in compared to overdraft fee revenues associated with an overdraft privilege program decreased  reflecting the impact of limitations imposed on such fees by federal legislation that requires all consumers to affirmatively opt in to the program 
the program change became effective in the third quarter of trust and financial management revenue increased  in compared to the value of assets under management is currently  at december   an increase of less than compared to similar values months ago 
fluctuations in the value of assets under management during the year have been mainly associated with fluctuations in the market values of equity securities 
also in  trust revenues included fees from the settlement of several large estates 
interchange revenue from debit card transactions has been segregated within the table iv presentation of other operating income for all periods presented 
interchange revenues are generally associated with the secure processing of electronic banking transactions for both business and individual retail customers 
the increase in interchange revenue in reflects the ongoing national trend for consumers increasing usage of debit cards 
the significance of this source of revenue  and the increase  also reflects the impact of the corporation s e z money checking product  which pays an attractive rate of interest  provided customers use their debit cards at least times per month and meet other requirements 
management believes this source of revenue may be significantly reduced in the future  perhaps beginning as early as the third quarter  depending on the final resolution of the federal reserve s proposal to greatly reduce the rate the corporation and other financial institutions will receive from interchange transactions 
annual totals for net gains from sales of loans are similarly shown in table iv to illustrate the impact of management s decision to sell a significant amount of residential mortgage originations into the secondary market 
for  the increase in the net gains from sales of loans is almost entirely associated with the corporation s participation in the mpf xtra program administered by the federal home loan banks of pittsburgh and chicago

fluctuations in the tax provision pre tax income rate for these periods include the impact of changes in the average holdings of tax exempt securities and loans 
the corporation recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
at december   the net deferred tax asset was million  down from a balance of approximately million at december  the decrease in the net deferred tax asset was primarily attributed to a reduction in the net deferred tax asset as of december  related to other than temporary impairment losses on securities to million at december  from million at december  in addition  the deferred tax asset as of december  includes million of net operating loss carryforwards available after the carryback of both ordinary and capital losses 
the corporation currently expects to fully realize all available tax benefits from the carryforward losses  and therefore has eliminated the valuation allowance of  previously established at december  the corporation regularly reviews deferred tax assets for recoverability based on history of earnings  expectations for future earnings and expected timing of reversals of temporary differences 
realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income  including taxable income in prior carryback years  as well as future taxable income 
based on current conditions  management believes the recorded net deferred tax asset at december  is fully realizable  including amounts classified as capital losses from securities 
in the fourth quarter  the corporation sold some securities for which other than temporary impairment losses otti had been recognized for financial reporting purposes in and the first nine months of as a result of these sales  the corporation realized both ordinary and capital tax losses for  and filed net operating loss carryback returns resulting in tax refunds totaling  received in from recovery of some of the taxes previously paid for  and the internal revenue service irs sent the corporation an information document request related to the corporation s federal return  as part of an evaluation to determine whether the return will be examined or accepted without examination 
the corporation has responded to the information document request  and has not yet received a determination from the irs 
in  the corporation sold some additional securities for which otti losses were recorded in prior years for financial reporting purposes 
as a result  management expects the corporation to have ordinary and capital tax losses for  and the corporation expects to file a net operating loss carryback return to recover additional taxes previously paid for and as reflected in a table in note to the consolidated financial statements  the refundable tax provision recorded in totaled approximately  a more complete analysis of income taxes is presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
securities table vi shows the composition of the investment portfolio at december   and comparison of the amortized cost totals of available for sale securities at each year end presented reflects a reduction of  to  at december  from december  this change was followed by an increase of  to  at december  in  the corporation shrank its available for sale investment portfolio through a combination of sales  not reinvesting cash flow from amortizing securities  and recognition of otti on certain securities 
this overall contraction was partially offset by purchases of agency bonds  agency collateralized mortgage obligations  and municipal bonds with relatively short expected lives 
during  the corporation grew its available for sale investment portfolio through purchases of municipal bonds and agency collateralized mortgage obligations and continued to focus on purchasing investments with relatively short expected lives

other assets decreased significantly at december   to  from  at december  other assets at december  included a balance receivable for income taxes paid in  as well as carry back for recovery of some tax paid for  totaling approximately million which was collected in the total of loans outstanding without consideration of the allowance for loan losses reflects total growth of  from the balance at december  to the total outstanding of  at december  the most significant increase of  came from balances acquired from citizens bancorp  inc in total loans have fallen slightly since the end of loan volumes are heavily dependent on economic conditions in the corporation s market area  and are significantly influenced by interest rates 
since the end of  the corporation experienced a net decrease in total loans outstanding under the consumer mortgage segment  with more residential mortgage originations than in previous years sold into the secondary market 
in september  the corporation initiated participation in the mpf xtra program administered by the federal home loan banks of pittsburgh and chicago for the sale of mortgage loans to the secondary market 
also  in the last three years  consumer loans have steadily decreased  to the december  balance of  total commercial segment loans have increased  from december  to december  table viii presents loan maturity data as of october  the last date in for which the corporation ran the interest rate simulation model used to generate the loan maturities information included in table viii 
the interest rate simulation model classifies certain loans under different categories than they appear in table vii 
fixed rate loans are included in table viii based on their contractually scheduled principal repayments  while variable rate loans are included based on contractual principal repayments  with the remaining balance reflected in the table as of the date of the next change in rate 
table viii shows that fixed rate loans are approximately of the loan portfolio 
of the of the portfolio made up of variable rate loans  a significant portion will re price after more than one year 
variable rate loans re pricing after more than one year include significant amounts of residential and commercial real estate loans 
the corporation s substantial investment in long term  fixed rate loans and variable rate loans with extended periods until re pricing is one of the concerns management attempts to address through interest rate risk management practices

notes and to the consolidated financial statements provide an overview of the process management uses for evaluating and determining the allowance for loan losses 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  changes in economic conditions may necessitate revisions in future years 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the corporation s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the corporation to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of their examination 
the allowance for loan losses of  at december  increased  from the total of  at december  the specific component related to impaired loans increased  during and was primarily attributed to five unrelated commercial relationships 
the provision for loan losses increased to  in from  in  with the higher provision in attributable to the increased allowance required on impaired commercial loans 
the total amount of the provision for loan losses for each year is determined based on the amount required to maintain an appropriate allowance in light of all of the factors described above and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
as shown in table ix  net charge offs in were  compared to  in and  in net charge offs in were substantially higher by comparison with other recent historical levels of  in and  in as a result of charge offs in of  from four large commercial relationships 
the allocation of the allowance for loan losses table table x includes the specific fasb asc component of the allowance on the line item called impaired loans 
the general component fasb asc of estimated losses  including both the portion determined based on historical net charge off results  as well as the portion based on management s assessment of qualitative factors  are allocated in table x to the applicable segments of consumer mortgage  commercial or consumer loans 
as of december   the specific valuation allowance on impaired loans includes  related to five unrelated commercial relationships compared with  related to two unrelated commercial relationships at the end of table x reflects a reduction in the collectively evaluated allowance on consumer mortgage loans  primarily because the three year average rate of net charge offs used in the general allowance calculation for that category of loans was lower at december  than it was as of the previous year end 
table x shows an increase in the collectively evaluated allowance on commercial loans  mainly because of an increase in the balance of commercial loans outstanding 
table xi presents information related to past due and impaired loans  and nonperforming assets 
as of december   total impaired loans amounted to  which is comparable to total impaired loans of  at december  as well as the previous year levels of  in   in  and  in total nonperforming assets increased to  at december  from  at december  the level of nonperforming assets as a percentage of assets of at december  is low by current banking industry standards  but slightly higher than the corporation s levels over over the period  each period includes a few large commercial relationships that have required significant monitoring and workout efforts 
as a result  a limited number of relationships have significantly impacted category fluctuations within table xi 
management believes it has been conservative in its decisions concerning identification of impaired loans  estimates of loss  and nonaccrual status  however  the actual losses realized from these relationships could vary materially from the allowances calculated as of december  management continues to closely monitor its commercial loan relationships for possible credit losses  and will adjust its estimates of loss and decisions concerning nonaccrual status  if appropriate

off balance sheet arrangements are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity liquidity is the ability to quickly raise cash at a reasonable cost 
an adequate liquidity position permits the corporation to pay creditors  compensate for unforeseen deposit fluctuations and fund unexpected loan demand 
at december   the corporation maintained overnight interest bearing deposits with the federal reserve bank of philadelphia and other correspondent banks totaling the corporation maintains overnight borrowing facilities with several correspondent banks that provide a source of day to day liquidity 
also  the corporation maintains borrowing facilities with the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh  secured by various mortgage loans 
the corporation has a line of credit with the federal reserve bank of philadelphia s discount window 
management intends to use this line of credit as a contingency funding source 
as collateral for the line  the corporation has pledged available for sale securities with a carrying value of  at december  the corporation s outstanding  available  and total credit facilities are presented in the following table

if required to raise cash in an emergency situation  the corporation could sell non pledged investment securities to meet its obligations 
at december   the carrying value of non pledged available for sale securities was  management believes the corporation is well positioned to meet its short term and long term obligations 
stockholders equity and capital adequacy the corporation and c n bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies 
details concerning regulatory capital amounts and ratios are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
as reflected in note  at december  and  the ratios of total capital to risk weighted assets  tier capital to risk weighted assets and tier capital to average total assets are well in excess of regulatory capital requirements 
in january  the corporation issued preferred stock and a warrant to purchase up to  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share to the united states department of the treasury under the tarp program for an aggregate price of  the preferred stock paid a cumulative dividend rate of per annum 
on august   the corporation redeemed all of the preferred stock 
subsequently  the corporation negotiated with the treasury for repurchase of the warrant on september  for a total cash cost of  which was recorded as a reduction in paid in capital 
as a result  the corporation is no longer subject to the requirements and limitations of the tarp program 
in  the corporation issued approximately  shares of common stock  raising a total of  net of related offering costs 
of this total   shares were issued at a price of per share in a public offering that was completed in december  and which resulted in net proceeds of  included in the  for the year 
the additional  was raised through the issuance of shares under our dividend reinvestment plan 
although the corporation maintained capital ratios that exceeded regulatory requirements to be considered well capitalized throughout  the additional capital provides flexibility to absorb any additional  unexpected securities losses or other economic issues that might arise 
further  the additional capital provided funding for repayment of the tarp preferred stock in  and improves the corporation s ability to respond to any opportunities that could arise for branch or full bank acquisitions 
future dividend payments will depend upon maintenance of a strong financial condition  future earnings and capital and regulatory requirements 
in addition  the corporation  and c n bank are subject to restrictions on the amount of dividends that may be paid without approval of banking regulatory authorities 
these restrictions are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the corporation s total stockholders equity is affected by fluctuations in the fair values of available for sale securities 
the difference between amortized cost and fair value of available for sale securities  net of deferred income tax  is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss income within stockholders equity 
the balance in accumulated other comprehensive loss income related to unrealized gains or losses on available for sale securities  net of deferred income tax  amounted to  at december  and  at december  changes in accumulated other comprehensive income are excluded from earnings and directly increase or decrease stockholders equity 
if available for sale securities are deemed to be other than temporarily impaired  unrealized losses are recorded as a charge against earnings  and amortized cost for the affected securities is reduced 
note to the consolidated financial statements provides additional information concerning management s evaluation of available for sale securities for other than temporary impairment at december  stockholders equity is also affected by the underfunded or overfunded status of defined benefit pension and postretirement plans 
the balance in accumulated other comprehensive loss income related to underfunded defined benefit plans  net of deferred income tax  was  at december  and  at december  comprehensive income loss comprehensive income or loss is a measure of the change in equity of a corporation  excluding transactions with owners in their capacity as owners such as proceeds from issuances of stock and dividends 
the difference between net income and comprehensive income is termed other comprehensive income loss 
comprehensive income or loss should not be construed to be a measure of net income 
for the corporation  other comprehensive income includes unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities  net of deferred income tax 
the amount of unrealized gains or losses reflected in comprehensive income may vary widely from period to period  depending on the financial markets as a whole and how the portfolio of available for sale securities is affected by interest rate movements 
the change in accumulated other comprehensive income attributable to the underfunded or overfunded status of defined benefit plans is also included in other comprehensive income 
in  total comprehensive income was  while in total comprehensive loss was  and in total comprehensive loss was  other comprehensive income loss amounted to  in   in  and  in inflation the corporation is significantly affected by the federal reserve board s efforts to control inflation through changes in short term interest rates 
beginning in september  in response to concerns about weakness in the us economy  the federal reserve lowered the fed funds target rate numerous times  in december  it took the unusual step of establishing a target range of to  which it has maintained throughout and also  the federal reserve has injected massive amounts of liquidity into the nation s monetary system through a variety of programs 
the federal reserve has purchased large amounts of securities in an effort to keep interest rates low and stimulate economic growth 
further  the federal reserve expressed its concern that deflation is currently more of a concern than inflation 
despite the current low short term rate environment and liquidity injections  inflation statistics indicate that the overall rate of inflation is minimal 
although management cannot predict future changes in the rates of inflation  management monitors the impact of economic trends  including any indicators of inflationary pressures  in managing interest rate and other financial risks

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices of the corporation s financial instruments 
in addition to the effects of interest rates  the market prices of the corporation s debt securities within the available for sale securities portfolio are affected by fluctuations in the risk premiums amounts of spread over risk free rates demanded by investors 
management cannot control changes in market prices of securities based on fluctuations in the risk premiums demanded by investors  nor can management control the volume of deferrals or defaults by other entities on trust preferred securities 
however  management attempts to limit the risk that economic conditions would force the corporation to sell securities for realized losses by maintaining a strong capital position discussed in the stockholders equity and capital adequacy section of management s discussion and analysis and ample sources of liquidity discussed in the liquidity section of management s discussion and analysis 
the corporation s two major categories of market risk are interest rate risk and equity securities risk  which are discussed in the following sections 
interest rate risk business risk arising from changes in interest rates is an inherent factor in operating a bank 
the corporation s assets are predominantly long term  fixed rate loans and debt securities 
funding for these assets comes principally from shorter term deposits and borrowed funds 
accordingly  there is an inherent risk of lower future earnings or decline in fair value of the corporation s financial instruments when interest rates change 
the corporation uses a simulation model to calculate the potential effects of interest rate fluctuations on net interest income and the market value of portfolio equity 
for purposes of these calculations  the market value of portfolio equity includes the fair values of financial instruments  such as securities  loans  deposits and borrowed funds  and the book values of nonfinancial assets and liabilities  such as premises and equipment and accrued expenses 
the model measures and projects potential changes in net interest income  and calculates the discounted present value of anticipated cash flows of financial instruments  assuming an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates 
management ordinarily runs a variety of scenarios within a range of plus or minus basis points of current rates 
the corporation s board of directors has established policy guidelines for acceptable levels of interest rate risk  based on an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates 
the policy provides limits at  and basis points from current rates for fluctuations in net interest income from the baseline flat rates one year scenario 
the policy also limits acceptable market value variances from the baseline values based on current rates 
table xv  which follows this discussion  is based on the results of the simulation model as of october  and november  the figures include a pro forma adjustment to increase equity by  which represents the proceeds received from the corporation s sale of common stock in december net of issuance costs 
the table also includes pro forma adjustments to reflect the corporation s december purchases of several investment securities 
the securities purchased totaled approximately  and included obligations of us government agencies and a collateralized mortgage obligation issued by a us government agency 
as indicated in the table  the corporation is liability sensitive  and therefore net interest income and market value generally increase when interest rates fall and decrease when interest rates rise 
the table shows that as of october   the changes in net interest income and changes in market value were within the policy limits in all scenarios except an immediate rate decrease of basis points  which management considers to be highly unrealistic 
as of november   the changes in net interest income and changes in market value were within the policy limits in all scenarios 
in december  the corporation entered into repurchase agreements borrowings totaling million to fund the purchase of investment securities 
the borrowings include embedded caps providing that  if month libor were to exceed  the interest rate payable on the repurchase agreements would fall  down to a minimum of  based on parameters included in the repurchase agreements 
three month libor has not exceeded since the embedded caps were acquired  therefore  they have not affected interest expense to date 
the embedded cap on one of the million borrowings expired in december  and the embedded cap on the other million borrowing expires in december the month libor was at october  and at november  since the embedded caps are effective only when month libor exceeds  the corporation would be unable to realize an interest expense reduction in any of the scenarios shown in table xv at october or november the model makes estimates  at each level of interest rate change  regarding cash flows from principal repayments on loans and mortgage backed securities and call activity on other investment securities 
actual results could vary significantly from these estimates  which could result in significant differences in the calculations of projected changes in net interest margin and market value of portfolio equity 
also  the model does not make estimates related to changes in the composition of the deposit portfolio that could occur due to rate competition  and the table does not necessarily reflect changes that management would make to realign the portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates

investments in bank stocks are subject to risk factors that affect the banking industry in general  including credit risk  competition from non bank entities  interest rate risk and other factors  which could result in a decline in market prices 
also  losses could occur in individual stocks held by the corporation because of specific circumstances related to each bank 
as discussed further in note of the consolidated financial statements  the corporation recognized otti charges on bank stocks totaling  in compared to  in and  in during the fourth quarter of  management decided to sell some bank stocks and liquidate the corporation s portfolio of non bank equity securities and mutual funds 
this decision was made primarily to generate capital losses  which could be carried back and offset against capital gains generated in  and to realize tax refunds 
as a result of these sales  the corporation s aggregate exposure to equities is significantly lower than in prior periods 
these sales were executed in the fourth quarter of and the first half of equity securities held as of december  and december  are presented in table xvi 
table xvi presents quantitative data concerning the effects of a decline in fair value of the corporation s equity securities of or 
the data in table xvi does not reflect the effects of any appreciation in value that may occur  nor does it present the corporation s maximum exposure to loss on equity securities  which would be of their fair value as of december  table xvi equity securities risk in thousands as of december  cost fair value hypothetical decline in market value hypothetical decline in market value
