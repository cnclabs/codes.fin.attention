items management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results and a 
of operations and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are an integrated energy company operating principally in the united states with two major business groups utilities and non regulated energy 
we report for our business groups in the following financial segments business group financial segment utilities electric utilities gas utilities non regulated energy oil and gas power generation coal mining energy marketing our utilities group consists of our electric and gas utility segments 
our electric utilities segment generates  transmits and distributes electricity to approximately  customers in south dakota  wyoming  colorado and montana and includes the operations of cheyenne light and its approximately  gas utility customers in wyoming 
our gas utilities segment serves approximately  natural gas customers in colorado  iowa  kansas and nebraska 
our non regulated energy group engages in the production of coal  natural gas  crude oil and coal  the production of electric power through ownership of a portfolio of generating plants and the sale of electric power and capacity primarily under mid and long term wholesale contracts  and in the marketing of natural gas  crude oil  coal  power and environmental products and related services primarily in the united states and canada 
industry overview the united states energy industry experienced another tumultuous year in the global economic crisis that commenced in late  and continued through  reduced energy demand 
energy commodity prices  which were near historic highs in mid  experienced dramatic declines in early while crude oil prices recovered notably through and in  natural gas prices have remained low 
domestic crude oil prices continued to be influenced by global factors  including foreign economic conditions especially in china and asia  the policies of opec and other large foreign oil producers  and political tensions and conflict in many regions 
however  the proliferation of domestic natural gas shale plays in recent years has provided the market an abundant new supply of natural gas 
combined with demand destruction from the economic downturn  this new and abundant supply source has created record volumes of natural gas in storage  and reduced domestic natural gas prices 
in fact  the ratio of crude oil to natural gas prices is at all time highs  far in excess of the six to one heating value equivalent ratio 
this trend is likely to continue for the foreseeable future given the expected further development of domestic shale gas reserves 
coal prices have also been volatile during the past year 
powder river basin spot prices btu per pound were per ton in late  but have been quite volatile during  trading as high as per ton 
toward the end of  pricing pulled back and power river basin coal was trading around per ton 
like other united states industries  the energy industry is faced with numerous uncertainties  both short and long term 
many utilities have large capital spending needs over the next few years to replace aging infrastructure  and add new assets such as transmission lines and renewable energy resources 
utility companies generally are less impacted by economic downturns  but the prolonged  severe recession has affected the demand for energy and the ability of customers to pay their utility bills  particularly in certain parts of the country 
the recession also impacted the ability of companies to obtain the capital necessary for infrastructure expansion 
in  the united states economy appears to have initiated a slow recovery from the deep recession 
for credit worthy companies  equity and debt financings were successfully undertaken throughout the state utility regulatory climate in remained relatively constructive among government  industry and consumer representatives 
in the seven state region encompassing our utility operations  regulators were willing to establish rates based on multi year considerations  including fuel and other reasonable cost adjustments  justifiable capital expenditures for maintenance and expansion of energy systems  and a response to environmental concerns through demand management and energy efficiency programs 
challenges remain  however  in obtaining satisfactory rate recovery for utility investments due to the general state of the economy and concern by regulators in various states that utility rate increases may cause further harm to local economies 
at the federal level  the passage of a major economic stimulus package by congress in  and the bailout of several too large to fail financial firms and automobile manufacturers  set the stage for an emphasis on increased regulation and government oversight of industry  which continued into in addition  in late  congress focused on the passage of major healthcare reform legislation 
the epa is likely to pass rules in that will likely require the potential closure of many older coal burning power plants 
state legislatures also remained active on environmental issues in  with a majority of states now having adopted some form of renewable energy standard  including some in which we operate 
in addition  several states have passed greenhouse gas emissions legislation  which places limits on the emissions of co and other greenhouse gases 
these known and potential legislative actions could have significant macroeconomic consequences  as the associated cost increases may cause a dramatic increase in consumer costs for products and services  including rates for electricity and other energy in the mid to long term 
the november elections caused a significant change in the domestic political environment  and a dramatic shift in domestic policy 
the passage in december of the tax relief  unemployment insurance reauthorization and job creation act of  extends through lower tax rates introduced in and  reduces the estate tax  extends unemployment benefits  reduces the social security portion of payroll taxes for employees  and extends bonus depreciation 
a benefit to our investors  the bill extends through the lower capital gains tax rate introduced by the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act of additionally  the bill extends the bonus depreciation for business property acquired after september  and placed into service prior to january  this provision will provide positive tax benefits for the colorado electric and colorado ipp generation projects currently under construction 
the energy marketplace continues to respond to the increased oversight and enforcement activity of ferc  and increased environmental and emissions reviews and mandates 
in recent years  several state regulatory agencies allowed electric utilities to construct and operate power plants in vertically integrated structures after years of discouraging or prohibiting such activity 
over the last decade  the corporate structure of many energy companies underwent evaluation and change  in large part due to efforts to create additional shareholder value 
since before the economic crisis  a number of companies contemplated or implemented a realignment of business lines  reflecting a shift in long term strategies 
some divested certain energy properties to focus on core businesses  such as exiting non regulated power production  or energy marketing in favor of more stable utility operations 
others engaged in mergers and acquisitions with a goal to improve economies of scale and returns to investors 
while mergers and acquisition activity in the utility industry essentially stopped during much of the past two years  several transactions have been announced in late and early which may signal a resumption of utility transactions 
private equity investors continued to play a role in the changing composition of energy ownership 
many industry analysts cite the need for expanded energy capacity and delivery systems 
they continue to foresee an increase in capital investment across a wide spectrum of energy companies 
many electric and gas utilities must replace aging plant and equipment  and regulators appear willing to provide acceptable rate treatment for additional utility investment  although the current state of the economy makes rate recovery more challenging in the short run 
oil and gas producers will continue to explore for new reserves  particularly natural gas  which will be the primary fuel of choice in light of concern regarding ghg emissions and the need to provide backup generation for renewable energy resources 
the growing focus on environmental regulation made it increasingly more difficult to obtain drilling permits  particularly on public and native american lands 
however  current low natural gas prices prompted some companies to curtail projects in order to conserve cash during a period of low cash flow and constrained capital markets 
fossil fuel combustion continues to be a contentious domestic and international public policy issue  as many nations  including united states allies  advocate reductions in co and other emissions 
many states now encourage the energy industry to invest in renewable energy resources  such as wind or solar power  or the use of bio mass as a fuel 
in many instances  renewable energy use is mandated by state regulators 
several years ago  the state of california mandated that future imports of power must come from power plants with emission levels no greater than combined cycle natural gas fired plants 
such restrictions may alter transmission flow of power in western states  as a large percentage of current power generation in the western grid comes from coal sources 
the power generation industry continues to make improvements in emissions control  voluntarily and in response to regulatory mandates 
emissions from new coal fired plants are now a small fraction of those produced by power plants built a generation ago 
with similar technological progress  coal can and likely will remain an important  domestically available  and economical national energy resource that is vital to meet growing energy demand 
in that regard  the doe is beginning to take positive steps toward ensuring the future of coal through research funding for clean coal technologies and methods of carbon capture and sequestration 
energy providers  government authorities and private interests continue to address issues concerning electric transmission  power generation capacity  the use of renewable and other diversified sources of energy  oil and natural gas pipelines and storage  and other infrastructure requirements 
in the short term  prevailing economic conditions will reduce industrial and retail energy consumption 
despite public and private efforts to promote conservation and efficiency  however  the demand for energy is expected to increase steadily over the long term 
to meet this demand growth  the industry will need to provide capital  resources and innovation to serve customers cost effectively  and to achieve suitable returns on investment 
we believe that we are well positioned in this industry setting  and able to proceed with our key business objectives 
along with industry counterparts  we are preparing to address the challenges discussed in this overview  such as new environmental regulations and mandates  renewable portfolio standards  co related taxes or trading practices  credit market conditions  inflation  or other factors that may affect energy demand and supply 
in particular  we are sensitive to additional costs that can negatively affect our customers or our profitability 
to that end  we intend to work closely with regulators and industry leaders to assure that cost conscious proposals and solutions are carefully explored in public policy proceedings 
business strategy we are a customer focused integrated energy company 
our business is comprised of electric and natural gas utility operations  power generation  and fuel assets and services  including the production of crude oil  natural gas and coal  and the marketing of natural gas  crude oil  coal  power and environmental products 
our focus on customers whether they are utility customers or non regulated generation  fuel or marketing customers provides opportunities to expand our businesses by constructing additional rate base assets to serve our utility customers and expand our non regulated energy holdings to provide additional products and services to our wholesale customers 
the diversity of our energy operations reduces reliance on any single business segment to achieve our strategic objectives 
it mitigates our overall corporate risk and enhances our ability to earn stronger returns for shareholders over the long term 
despite challenging conditions in the capital markets over the past few years  we have demonstrated our ability to access the debt and equity markets  resulting in sufficient liquidity and solid cash flows 
consequently  our financial foundation is sound and capable of supporting an expansion of operations in both the near and long term 
during  we focused on completing the integration of the five utility properties acquired from aquila in mid and the achievement of certain operating efficiencies made possible by the acquisition 
during we built upon the successful consolidation of our customer information system by unifying our employee pay and benefits programs and completing substantially all of our major systems consolidations  including our human resource and financial systems  gis mapping system  work management system and scada system 
our long term strategy focuses on growing both our utility and non regulated energy businesses  primarily by increasing our customer base and providing superior service to both utility and non regulated energy customers 
in our natural gas and electric utilities  we intend to significantly grow our asset base to serve projected customer demand and to comply with environmental mandates in our existing utility service territories through expansion of infrastructure and construction of new rate based power generation facilities 
we also plan to pursue acquisitions of additional utility properties  primarily in the great plains and rocky mountain regions of the country 
by maintaining our high customer service and reliability standards in a cost efficient manner  our goal is to secure appropriate rate recovery to provide solid economic returns on our utility investments 
we will continue to prudently grow and develop our existing inventory of oil and gas reserves  while we strive to maintain strong relationships with mineral owners  landowners and regulatory authorities 
we intend to focus our near term efforts on proving up the shale gas potential of our san juan and piceance basin properties  while continuing our participation in the bakken oil shale play and other oil related exploration opportunities 
given increased regulatory emphasis on wind and solar power generation  and potential environmental regulations and legislation that may limit construction of new coal fired power plants  natural gas will be the fuel of choice for power generation 
additional gas fired peaking resources will also be required to provide critical back up supplies for renewable technologies 
we will continue efforts to develop additional markets for our coal production  including the development of additional power plants at our mine site 
we also intend to utilize the newly acquired coal marketing expertise within our energy marketing operations to develop additional rail served sales opportunities for our coal 
nearly of all electricity generated in the united states is currently supplied from coal fired power plants 
it will take decades and significant expense before this generation can be replaced with alternative technologies 
as a result  coal fired resources will remain a necessary component of the nation electric supply for the foreseeable future 
potential greenhouse gas legislation may limit construction of new conventional coal fired power plants  but technologies such as carbon capture and sequestration should provide for the long term economic use of coal 
we are investigating the possible deployment of these technologies at our mine site in wyoming 
we have expertise in permitting  constructing and operating power generation facilities 
these skills  combined with our understanding of electric resource planning and regulatory procedures  provide a significant opportunity for us to add long term shareholder value 
we intend to grow our non regulated power generation business by continuing to focus on long term contractual relationships with other load serving utilities 
the expertise of our energy marketing business should provide continued long term profitability through a risk managed and disciplined approach to the marketing of natural gas  crude oil  coal  power and environmental products 
we will continue to utilize our marketing expertise to enhance the value of our other energy assets  particularly our fuel and power generation assets 
during  in an effort to lessen the dependence of our energy marketing earnings on natural gas  we added coal  power and environmental products to our marketing portfolio 
key elements of our business strategy provide stable long term rates for customers and increase earnings by efficiently planning  constructing and operating rate base power generation facilities needed to serve our electric utilities  proactively integrate alternative and renewable energy into our utility energy supply while mitigating and remaining mindful of customer rate impacts  expand utility operations through selective acquisitions of electric and gas utilities consistent with our regional focus and strategic advantages  build and maintain strong relationships with wholesale power customers of both our utilities and non regulated power generation businesses  selectively grow our non regulated power generation business in targeted regional markets by developing assets and selling most of the capacity and energy production through mid and long term contracts primarily to load serving utilities  exploit our fuel cost advantages and our operating and marketing expertise to produce and sell power at attractive margins  increase the value of our oil and gas properties by prudently growing our reserves and increasing our production of natural gas and crude oil  expand our energy marketing operations opportunistically in the area of natural gas  crude oil  coal  power and environmental products as market conditions warrant  diligently manage the credit  price and operational risks inherent in buying and selling energy commodities  and maintain an investment grade credit rating and ready access to debt and equity capital markets 
provide stable long term rates for customers and increase earnings by efficiently planning  constructing and operating rate base power generation facilities needed to serve our electric utilities 
our company began as a vertically integrated electric utility  and this business model remains a core strength and strategy today  as we invest in and operate efficient power generation resources to cost effectively transmit and distribute electricity to our customers 
we provide power at reasonable and stable rates to our customers  and earn competitive returns for our investors 
rate base generation assets offer several advantages for consumers  regulators and investors 
first  since the generating assets are included in the utility rate base and reviewed and approved by government authorities  customer rates are more stable than if the power was purchased from the open market through wholesale contracts that are renegotiated over time 
second  regulators participate in a planning process where long term investments are designed to match long term energy demand 
third  investors are assured that a long term  reasonable  stable rate of return may be earned on their investment 
a lower risk profile may also improve credit ratings which  in turn  can benefit both consumers and investors by lowering our cost of capital 
examples of our progress include the january completion of wygen ii to serve the customers of cheyenne light and the april completion of wygen iii to serve the customers of black hills power 
during  our colorado electric subsidiary completed a comprehensive resource planning process  through which we received approval to construct a mw gas fired power plant as a rate base asset to serve the customers of colorado electric 
construction commenced on this facility in july and its projected commercial operation date is december  existing legislation in colorado will require the retirement of colorado electric wn clark plant by december  pending epa regulations covering hazardous air pollutants may necessitate the early retirement of several of our older coal fired power plants  including black hills power osage  ben french and neil simpson i plants and colorado electric wn clark plant 
although we are still evaluating alternatives  it is likely that we will recommend replacing these facilities with rate based natural gas fired power plants 
using reasonable assumptions  we have also carefully evaluated our coal fired generating facilities and the potential future economic impact of a carbon tax or cap and trade regime intended to reduce co emissions 
for customers in states without renewable or co mandates  such as south dakota and wyoming  we believe it is in our utility customers long term interest to construct new mine mouth  coal fired generating facilities  such as our wygen ii generation facility completed in january and our wygen iii generation facility completed in april 
constructing these state of the art  cost efficient  coal fired facilities allows us to plan for the future retirement of older  less efficient plants with higher emissions and keep rates reasonable for customers 
in addition  we are actively evaluating alternative coal fired generation technologies  including igcc and carbon capture and sequestration  though both appear cost prohibitive in the near term 
these technologies may become cost effective in the future if regulatory or legislative actions place a sufficiently high price on co 

emissions or further technological advancements reduce the costs of those technologies 
the location of our coal mine and power plant complex in the powder river basin of wyoming provides key strategic advantages for carbon capture and sequestration projects  such as readily available saline aquifers for the injection and sequestration of co  as well as a potential co 

market for use in enhanced oil recovery projects 
additionally  the wyoming legislature has been proactive in passing legislation to address pore space ownership  injection regulations and other legal issues associated with the underground sequestration of co proactively integrate alternative and renewable energy into our utility energy supply while mitigating and remaining mindful of customer rate impacts 
the energy and utility industries face tremendous uncertainty related to the potential impact of legislation and regulation intended to reduce ghg emissions and increase the use of renewable and other alternative energy sources 
to date  many states have enacted and others are considering some form of mandatory renewable energy standard  requiring utilities to meet certain thresholds of renewable energy use 
additionally  many states have either enacted or are considering legislation setting ghg emissions reduction targets 
federal legislation for both renewable energy standards and ghg emission reductions is also under consideration 
mandates for the use of renewable energy or the reduction of ghg emissions will likely produce substantial increases in the prices for electricity and natural gas 
at the same time  however  as a regulated utility we are responsible for providing safe  reasonably priced  reliable sources of energy to our customers 
as a result  we have developed a customer centered strategy for renewable energy standards and ghg emission reductions that balances our customers rate concerns with environmental considerations and legislative mandates 
we attempt to strike this balance by prudently and proactively incorporating renewable energy into our resource supply  while seeking to minimize the magnitude and frequency of rate increases for our utility customers 
examples of our balanced approach include in states such as south dakota and wyoming that currently have no legislative mandate on the use of renewable energy  we have proactively integrated cost effective renewable energy into our generation supply based upon our expectation that there will be mandatory renewable energy standards in the future 
for example  under two year ppas we purchase a total of mw of wind energy from wind farms located near cheyenne  wyoming for use at black hills power and cheyenne light  colorado and montana have legislative mandates regarding the use of renewable energy  therefore we aggressively pursue cost effective initiatives with the regulators that will allow us to meet our renewable energy requirements 
in colorado for instance  we filed an electric resource plan that includes enough renewable energy additions and ghg emission reductions to permit us to satisfy the state requirement that of a utility distributed energy must be supplied by renewable energy resources by to the extent practical  we intend to construct renewable generation resources as rate base assets  which will help mitigate the long term customer rate impact of adding renewable energy supplies  and in all states in which we conduct electric utility operations  we are exploring other potential biomass  solar and wind energy projects  particularly wind generation sites located near our utility service territories 
expand utility operations through selective acquisitions of electric and gas utilities consistent with our regional focus and strategic advantages 
for nearly years we have provided reliable utility services  delivering quality and value to our customers 
our tradition of accomplishment supports efforts to expand our utility operations into other markets  most likely in areas that permit us to take advantage of our intrinsic competitive advantages  such as baseload power generation  system reliability  superior customer service  community involvement and a relationship based approach to regulatory matters 
the acquisition of cheyenne light and the aquila transaction are examples of such expansion efforts 
utility operations also enhance other important business development  including gas transmission pipelines and storage infrastructure  which could promote other non regulated energy operations 
utility operations can contribute substantially to the stability of our long term cash flows  earnings and dividend policy 
through our recently completed integration of the utilities we acquired in mid  we have a platform of systems and processes which are very scalable  which would simplify the integration of potential future utility acquisitions 
although we do not expect to make any significant utility acquisitions in the near term  merger and acquisition activity has increased in recent months 
we believe that impacts of the current recession may produce opportunities for healthy utility companies to acquire utility assets and operations of less creditworthy companies upon attractive terms and conditions 
we would expect to consider such opportunities if we believe they would further our long term strategy and help maximize shareholder value 
build and maintain strong relationships with wholesale power customers of both our utilities and non regulated power generation business 
we strive to build strong relationships with other utilities  municipalities and wholesale customers and believe we will continue to be a primary provider of electricity to wholesale utility customers 
we further believe that these entities will continue to need products  such as capacity  in order to reliably serve their customers 
by providing these products under long term contracts  we are able to help our customers meet their energy needs 
through this approach  we also believe we can earn more stable revenues and greater returns over the long term than we could by selling energy into more volatile spot markets 
in addition  relationships that we ve established with wholesale power customers have developed into other opportunities 
mean and mdu  both wholesale power customers  are now also joint owners in two of our power plants  wygen i and wygen iii  respectively 
selectively grow our non regulated power generation business in targeted regional markets by developing assets and selling most of the capacity and energy production through mid and long term contracts primarily to load serving utilities 
in mid  we divested of seven ipp plants for a total of million 
while much of our recent power plant development has been for our regulated utilities  we intend to continue to expand our non regulated power generation business by developing and operating power plants in regional markets based on prevailing supply and demand fundamentals in a manner that complements our existing fuel assets and marketing capabilities 
we intend to grow this business through a combination of the development of new power generation facilities and disciplined acquisitions primarily in the western region where our detailed knowledge of market and electric transmission fundamentals provides us a competitive advantage  and  consequently increases our ability to earn attractive returns 
we expect to prioritize small scale facilities that serve incremental growth or provide critical back up to renewable resources  and are typically easier to permit and construct than large scale generation projects 
most of the energy and capacity from our non regulated power facilities is sold under mid and long term contracts 
when possible  we structure long term contracts as tolling arrangements  whereby the contract counterparty assumes the fuel risk 
going forward  we will continue to focus on selling a majority of our non regulated capacity and energy primarily to load serving utilities under long term agreements that have been reviewed or approved by state utility commissions 
an example of this strategy is the mw of combined cycle gas fired generation being constructed by our non regulated power generation subsidiary to serve our colorado electric utility subsidiary beginning january   under a year tolling agreement 
with respect to our current power sale agreements  two of our long term power contracts provide for the sale of capacity and energy to cheyenne light from our gillette ct and wygen i plants 
the gillette ct contract expires in  and as part of our integrated resource planning efforts  the company is evaluating a potential extension of the contract 
the wygen i contract was extended during and now expires in  but provides an option for cheyenne light to purchase and rate base a portion of wygen i 
exploit our fuel cost advantages and our operating and marketing expertise to produce and sell power at attractive margins 
we expect to selectively expand our portfolio of power plants which have relatively low marginal costs of producing energy and related products and services 
we intend to utilize a competitive power production strategy  together with access to coal and natural gas reserves  to be competitive as a power generator 
competitive production costs can result from a variety of factors  including low fuel costs  efficiency in converting fuel into energy  and low per unit operation and maintenance costs 
in addition  we typically operate our plants with high levels of availability  as compared to industry benchmarks 
we aggressively manage each of these factors with the goal of achieving low production costs 
one of our primary competitive advantages is our wrdc coal mine  which is located in reasonably close proximity to our electric utility service territories 
we leverage this competitive advantage by building additional state of the art mine mouth coal fired generating capacity  which allows us to substantially eliminate fuel transportation and storage costs 
this strengthens our position as a low cost producer because transportation costs often represent the largest component of the delivered cost of coal for many other utilities 
increase the value of our oil and gas properties by prudently growing our reserves and increasing our production of natural gas and crude oil 
our strategy is to cost effectively grow our reserves and increase our production of natural gas and crude oil through both organic growth and acquisitions 
while consistent growth remains our objective  we realize the necessity of managing for value creation over managing for growth as follows through detailed reservoir analysis  apply proven technologies to our existing assets to maximize value  participate in a limited number of selective and meaningful exploration prospects  primarily focus on the rocky mountain region  where we can more easily integrate new opportunities with our existing oil and natural gas operations as well as our fuel marketing and or power generation activities 
specifically  we intend to focus our near term efforts on fully evaluating the shale gas potential of our san juan and piceance basin properties  continuing our participation in the bakken oil shale play and participating in select oil exploration prospects with substantial upside opportunities  support the future capital requirements of our drilling program by stabilizing cash flows with a hedging program that mitigates commodity price risk for a substantial portion of our established production for up to two years in the future  and enhance our oil and gas production activities with the construction or acquisition of mid stream gathering  compression and treating facilities in a manner that maximizes the economic value of our operations 
expand our energy marketing operations opportunistically in the area of natural gas  crude oil  coal  power and environmental products as market conditions warrant 
our energy marketing business seeks to provide services to producers and end users of natural gas  crude oil  coal  power and environmental products and to capitalize on market volatility by employing certain risk managed commodity trading strategies 
the diversity of the commodities portfolio that we market helps us optimize value for shareholders 
the service provider focus of our energy marketing activities largely differentiates us from other energy marketers 
through our producer services group  we assist mostly small to medium sized independent producers throughout the western united states with marketing and transporting their crude oil and natural gas 
through our origination services  we work with utilities  municipalities and industrial users of natural gas to provide customized delivery services  as well as to support their efforts to optimize their transportation and storage positions 
our coal marketing team assists small utility and industrial coal consumers manage their coal procurement and transportation functions 
similarly  our power marketing experts helps both buyers and sellers of electricity  as well as assisting customers with the monetization of emissions or other environmental products 
diligently manage the credit  price and operational risks inherent in buying and selling energy commodities 
all of our operations require effective management of counterparty credit risk 
we mitigate this risk by conducting business with a diverse group of creditworthy counterparties 
in certain cases where creditworthiness merits security  we require prepayment  secured letters of credit or other forms of financial collateral 
we establish counterparty credit limits and employ continuous credit monitoring  with regular review of compliance under our credit policy by our executive credit committee 
our oil and gas  power generation and energy marketing operations require effective management of price and operational risks related to adverse changes in commodity prices and the volatility and liquidity of the commodity markets 
to mitigate these risks  we implemented risk management policies and procedures  particularly for our marketing operations 
our oversight committees monitor compliance with these policies 
we also limit exposure to energy marketing risks by maintaining an energy marketing credit facility separate from our corporate credit facility 
maintain an investment grade credit rating and ready access to debt and equity capital markets 
access to capital has been and will continue to be critical to our success 
we will require access to the capital markets to fund our planned capital investments or  when possible  to make strategic acquisitions that prudently grow our businesses 
our access to adequate and cost effective financing depends upon our ability to maintain our investment grade issuer credit rating 
disruption in worldwide capital markets over the past few years has reduced liquidity in the debt capital markets and caused significant write offs in the financial services sector  the re pricing of credit risk  and the failure of certain financial institutions 
despite actions of the united states government  these events contributed to a general economic decline that materially and adversely impacted the broader financial and credit markets  and reduced the availability of debt and equity capital  particularly in late and our acquisition of additional utility properties in  combined with the divestiture of seven ipp plants  reduced our overall corporate risk profile 
even so  our access to capital markets was negatively impacted by the conditions described above  particularly during the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of notwithstanding these adverse market conditions  in addition to several financings during  in we completed additional key financings on reasonable terms  including a net million equity offering  a million senior unsecured corporate bond offering  a million term loan  and renewal of our revolving credit facility 
prospective information we expect to generate long term growth through the expansion of integrated and diverse energy operations 
we recognize that sustained growth requires continued capital deployment 
our diversified energy portfolio with an emphasis on regulated utilities provides growth opportunities  yet avoids concentrating business risk 
we expect much of our growth in the next few years will come from major capital investments at our existing segments 
as capital market conditions improved in  we were able to complete several key debt and equity financings 
we are confident in our ability to obtain additional financing to continue our growth plans 
we will remain focused on managing our operations cautiously and maintaining our overall liquidity to meet our operating  capital and financing needs  as well as execute our long term strategic plan 
utilities group the utilities group successfully completed four rate cases in and completed integration activities subsequent to the aquila transaction which establishes a growth platform that delivers value to our shareholders 
during  the utilities group unified the gis mapping system and integrated the scada systems and along with our non regulated group  completed conversion to a single human resources  inventory management and accounting system 
electric utilities we benefited from an increase in rates resulting from three rate cases 
an approved revenue increase of million went into effect april  for south dakota customers  an approved annual revenue increase of million went into effect june  for wyoming customers  and an approved annual revenue increase of million went into effect on august  for our colorado electric customers 
included in the colorado electric rate case order was a provision that off system sales margins be shared with customers commencing august  the percentage of margin to be shared with the customers was not resolved at the time of the rate case settlement 
the cpuc has therefore required that the off system sales margins earned beginning august  be deferred on the balance sheet until settlement of the sharing mechanism 
colorado electric is preparing a proposal for a sharing mechanism to be filed with the cpuc 
business at black hills power remained relatively strong in construction of the wygen iii power plant was completed and the plant commenced commercial operation on april  a ownership interest in the wygen iii plant was sold to the city of gillette for million 
black hills power now owns of the facility with the city of gillette owning and mdu owning the remaining 
we continue to focus on colorado electric energy resource plan 
in july  construction commenced on a mw gas fired generation facility that will serve colorado electric customers upon expiration of the current ppa with psco 
construction is expected to cost between million and million and commercial operations are expected to begin by january  the addition of these plants to our utility rate base and a successful approval of our proposed rate case will have a significant positive impact on our financial results 
we plan to file a rate case that anticipates the inclusion of new generation and transmission assets in customer rates beginning upon the commencement of commercial operation of the plants 
in december  colorado electric received a final order from the cpuc which approved the retirement of its wn clark coal fired generation facility by december  and granted a presumption of need in the amount of mw for replacement of the plant with gas fired generation 
colorado electric will file a certificate of public convenience and necessity to provide justification for an additional mw of generating capacity to allow the construction of a mw natural gas fired facility 
the expiration and replacement of the psco contract at colorado electric requires additional capacity and energy needs of approximately mw 
the remaining capacity and energy needed was acquired through a competitive bidding process including other power producers 
our power generation segment participated in this bidding process  and in september  our power generation segment was awarded the bid to provide mw of capacity and energy to colorado electric through a year ppa 
our electric utilities are receiving funding available through the american recovery and reinvestment act of to install  smart meters 
we have completed of the installations and expect to have expended all grant funds by the end of gas utilities our gas utilities are focused on the continued investment in our gas distribution network and related technology such as automated meter reading and mobile data terminals 
we received approval for rate increases of million at nebraska gas and filed a rate request for an increase in revenues of million at iowa gas 
in august  we reached a settlement with the oca for a revenue increase at iowa gas of million 
this settlement agreement was modified and re filed on january  the modified settlement excludes the integrity investment tracker and the three year rate moratorium included in the original settlement agreement filed on september   which was not approved by the iub 
approval of the modified settlement was received from the iub on february  we continually monitor our investments and costs of operations in all states to determine when additional rate case or other rate filings will be necessary 
non regulated energy group power generation our power generation segment was awarded the bid to provide mw of power to our colorado electric subsidiary through a year ppa 
construction of two mw combined cycle natural gas fired power generation facilities in colorado commenced in july construction is expected to cost between million and million and commercial operations are expected to commence prior to december  we plan to continue evaluating opportunities to bid on the construction of generation resources  both new and existing  for other regional electric utilities for their energy and capacity needs 
coal mining production from the coal mining segment primarily serves mine mouth generation plants and select regional customers with long term fuel needs 
total annual production is estimated to be approximately million tons in our primary strategy is to sell the majority of our coal production to on site  mine mouth generation facilities under long term supply contracts 
historically our off site sales have been to consumers within a close proximity to our mine 
we have recently extended two smaller volume off site sales contracts and anticipate continued off site sales to pacificorp dave johnson power plant through a contract which expires at the end of there are some limitations in regards to transporting our lower heat content coal  but we are reviewing new opportunities to market our coal 
oil and gas during we initiated a review of our oil and gas strategy and assets that will continue until at least mid bhep mission in was to identify future investment opportunities while conserving capital and strictly controlling costs 
this task will continue into  in anticipation of providing attractive oil and gas investment opportunities as more capital becomes available following completion and commissioning of the plants under construction by colorado electric and colorado ipp 
energy marketing we have a marketing portfolio with a significant amount of optionality that can provide opportunities to create economic value over the next several years 
while we expect to derive earnings from these contracts over many years  market conditions and the required methods of accounting for these transactions could result in additional earnings volatility during the term of these contracts 
during and continuing into  there was a significant contraction in the availability of capital 
despite these challenges  we entered into a two year committed enserco credit facility on may  in june  our energy marketing segment expanded the commodities it markets to include coal through an acquisition of a coal marketing business for million and the addition of six new employees 
the business focuses on sourcing coal from wyoming powder river basin for delivery to customers in the western united states 
our average daily marketing physical volumes since the acquisition were approximately  tons of coal 
in the fourth quarter of  our energy marketing segment expanded into power and environmental marketing through the addition of four experienced employees 
corporate during  we completed two long term financings including a million senior unsecured bond offering which is being used to fund construction of generation facilities to serve our colorado electric customers and a forward equity offering of  shares 
we also entered into a new million revolving credit facility and a million term loan to fund our working capital needs and for other corporate purposes 
we have substantially completed the integration of processes and systems resulting from our acquisition of five utility properties in mid the unified systems and processes provide us with a scalable platform for future growth 
as of december   we had interest rate swaps with a notional amount of million  which do not currently qualify for hedge accounting treatment provided by accounting standards for derivatives and hedges 
accordingly  all mark to market adjustments on these swaps are recorded through the income statement 
as of december   the mark to market value of these swaps was a liability of million 
in  we recorded an unrealized mark to market after tax loss of million on these swaps 
fluctuations in interest rates create volatility in the fair value of these swaps which will likely have an impact on our earnings as we record the associated unrealized mark to market gains or losses within our income statement

a discussion of operating results from our business segments follows 
utilities group electric utilities operating results for the years ended december for the electric utilities were as follows in thousands a revenue electric revenue cheyenne light gas total revenue fuel and purchased power electric purchased gas cheyenne light total fuel and purchased power gross margin electric gross margin cheyenne light gas total gross margin operations and maintenance gain on sale of operating asset depreciation and amortization total operating expenses operating income interest expense  net other income income tax expense income from continuing operations and net income a results include the operations of colorado electric acquired on july  regulated power plant fleet availability coal fired plants other plants total availability compared to income from continuing operations was million in compared to million in as a result of gross margin gross margin increased million primarily due to a million increase related to the impact of the outcome of the black hills power and colorado electric rate cases  an increase of million for updated transmission cost adjustments at colorado electric  an increase of million in off system sales margin as a result of a change in the methodology used at black hills power to allocate the cost of renewable resources and firm purchases  and increased intercompany revenues of million due to a new shared services agreement related to resources utilized by affiliated entities 
operations and maintenance operations and maintenance expenses increased million primarily due to additional costs of million associated with the operations of wygen iii  which commenced commercial operation on april   increased intercompany costs of million related to a new shared services agreement  and costs of million associated with a major overhaul at the ben french plant 
gain on sale of operating assets a million gain on sale was recognized on the sale of a ownership interest in the wygen iii generating facility to the city of gillette 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased million primarily due to the addition of the wygen iii plant placed into service on april  interest expense  net interest expense  net increased million due to higher net interest expense of million compared to the same period in the prior year due to debt incurred for plant construction and as a result of higher rates associated with long term financings in compared to rates on short term debt held in  partially offset by an increase in afudc borrowed of million 
afudc borrowed increased million at colorado electric for the plant construction  offset by a decrease in afudc borrowed at black hills power of million due to the commencement of commercial operations of wygen iii 
other income other income decreased million primarily due to lower afudc equity of million  which decreased upon the placement of wygen iii into commercial operations on april  additionally  included a gain of million from the sale of so emission credits 
income tax expense the effective tax rate decreased primarily as a result of a million tax benefit for a rate case settlement related to expensing certain items that had been capitalized for income tax purposes  partially offset by lower benefit from afudc equity which decreased upon commercial operations of wygen iii 
compared to results include a full year of operations at colorado electric  which was acquired on july  income from continuing operations was million in compared to million in as a result of gross margin gross margins reflect the acquisition of colorado electric in july in addition to a million decrease in margins from off system sales reflecting the lower margins available in the current low energy price environment partially offset by a million increase in other margins primarily due to an increase in transmission rates effective january  at black hills power 
operations and maintenance operations and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to the acquisition of colorado electric in july depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization costs increased million primarily due to additional depreciation associated with the acquisition of colorado electric in july interest expense  net interest expense  net increased million primarily due to additional debt associated with the acquisition of colorado electric  additional long term project debt at black hills power  and inter segment debt restructuring at colorado electric  partially offset by afudc borrowed 
other income other income increased million primarily due to an increase in afudc equity of million from the construction of wygen iii in and the sale of so emission credits of million by black hills power 
gas utilities operating results for the years ended december for the gas utilities were as follows in thousands for the period july  to december  revenue natural gas regulated other non regulated total sales cost of sales natural gas regulated other non regulated total cost of sales gross margin natural gas regulated other non regulated total gross margin operations and maintenance gain on sale of operating assets depreciation and amortization total operating expenses operating income interest expense  net other expense income income tax expense income from continuing operations and net income compared to income from continuing operations was million in compared to million in as a result of gross margin gross margin increased million primarily due to new and interim rates at iowa gas  nebraska gas and colorado gas  and an approved gas system reliability surcharge at kansas gas  which were not effective for a full year in  partially offset by lower volumes as a result of milder weather 
operations and maintenance operations and maintenance expenses increased million primarily due to increases in employee benefit costs  workers compensation insurance and litigation related accruals 
gain on sale of operating assets a million gain on sale was recognized on assets transferred by nebraska gas to the city of omaha  nebraska after a portion of nebraska gas service territory was annexed by the city 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization decreased million primarily due to assets becoming fully depreciated during and interest expense  net interest expense  net increased million primarily due to higher interest rates within the assigned capital structure 
other expense other expense was comparable to the same period in the prior year 
income tax expense the effective tax rate for was comparable to the effective tax rate in the prior year 
compared to the gas utilities located in colorado  nebraska  iowa and kansas were acquired on july  income from continuing operations was million in  compared to million in the increase was primarily due to a full year of gas utilities operation in compared to the partial year in natural gas demand is typically higher in the first and fourth quarters as gas is used for residential and commercial heating 
the gas utilities have gcas that allow them to pass through the cost of gas to customers 
for this reason  we believe gross margins are a more useful performance measure than revenues as fluctuations in the cost of gas are passed through to revenues 
in addition to a full year of operations at the gas utilities  results were impacted by favorable weather as well as rate increases from general rate cases in colorado million annual increase effective april   general rate cases in iowa million annual increase effective july   and from cost tracking riders in kansas million annual increase effective september  
non regulated energy group oil and gas oil and gas operating results for the years ended december were as follows in thousands revenue operations and maintenance depreciation  depletion and amortization impairment of long lived assets total operating expenses operating income loss interest expense  net other income income tax benefit expense income loss from continuing operations and net income loss the following tables provide certain operating statistics for the oil and gas segment crude oil and natural gas production bbls of oil sold mcf of natural gas sold mcf equivalent sales average price received a gas mcf b oil bbl a net of hedge settlement gains losses b exclusive of gas liquids depletion expense mcfe the average depletion rate per mcfe is a function of capitalized costs  future development costs and the related underlying reserves in the periods presented 
the rate was particularly impacted by a lower asset base as a result of previous asset impairment charges 
this impact was partially offset by persistent low product prices during the year  which resulted in lower oil and gas reserve quantities

as a result  and gathering  compression and processing have been modified to reflect the removal of these assets for comparative purposes 
at the east blanco field in new mexico and our piceance basin assets in colorado  we own and operate gas gathering systems  including associated compression and treating facilities 
the following is a summary of our proved oil and gas reserves at december bbls of oil in thousands mmcf of natural gas total mmcfe reserves are based on reports prepared by an independent consulting and engineering firm 
the reports were prepared by cg a 
reserves were determined using sec defined product prices 
such reserve estimates are inherently imprecise and may be subject to revisions as a result of numerous factors including  but not limited to  additional development activity  evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 
the current estimate takes into account production of approximately bcfe  additions from extensions  discoveries and acquisitions of bcfe and positive revisions to previous estimates of bcfe  primarily due to higher product prices 
reserves reflect sec defined pricing held constant for the life of the reserves  as follows oil gas oil gas oil gas nymex prices well head reserve prices on december   the sec issued final rules amending its oil and gas reserve reporting requirements effective for years ending on or after december  the final rule changed the use of prices at the end of each reporting period to an average of the first day of the month for the preceding twelve months held constant for the life of production 
previously  the rule required the use of the spot price on the last day of the reporting period  held constant for the life of production 
compared to income from continuing operations was million in compared to a loss from continuing operations of million in as a result of revenue revenue increased million primarily due to a and increase in the annual average hedged price of oil and gas  respectively  and a increase in oil production  partially offset by a decrease of in gas production 
the increase in oil production is primarily due to production of new wells in our ongoing bakken drilling program 
the decrease in natural gas production was largely driven by natural production declines from producing properties  and reduced capital deployment during and operations and maintenance operations and maintenance expenses decreased million primarily as a result of cost containment efforts 
impairment of long lived assets results reflect a million non cash ceiling test impairment charge taken during the first quarter of the write down in the net carrying value of our natural gas and crude oil properties resulted from low march  quarter end natural gas prices for the commodities

compared to loss from continuing operations was million compared to a loss from continuing operations of million in as a result of revenue revenue decreased million primarily due to a and decrease in the annual average hedged price of oil and gas received  respectively  and a and decrease in oil and gas production  respectively 
the decrease in natural gas production is due to a lower level of capital spending than in prior years and a voluntary shut in of production at properties with the highest operating costs 
shut ins reduced production for the year ended december  by approximately mmcfe 
operations and maintenance operations and maintenance expenses decreased million primarily due to decreased loe of million as a result of lower production and cost reduction efforts and decreased production taxes of approximately million primarily due to lower oil and natural gas prices

partially offsetting these was a million increase in net interest expense primarily due to interest settlements of the de designated interest rate swaps and amortization of amendment fees to extend the mandatory early termination dates of these swaps through the end of critical accounting estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap and does not require management judgment in application 
there are also areas which require management judgment in selecting among available gaap alternatives 
we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
actual results may differ from our estimates and to the extent there are material differences between these estimates  judgments or assumptions and actual results  our financial statements will be affected 
we believe the following accounting estimates are the most critical in understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
we have reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with our audit committee 
the following discussion of our critical accounting estimates should be read in conjunction with note  business description and summary of significant accounting policies of our notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate for impairment  the carrying values of our long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangibles  whenever indicators of impairment exist and at least annually for goodwill as required by accounting standards 
for long lived assets with finite lives  this evaluation is based upon our projections of anticipated future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges from the assets being evaluated 
if the sum of the anticipated future cash flows over the expected useful life of the assets is less than the assets carrying value  then a permanent non cash write down equal to the difference between the assets carrying value and the assets fair value is required to be charged to earnings 
in estimating future cash flows  we generally use a probability weighted average expected cash flow method with assumptions based on those used for internal budgets 
the determination of future cash flows  and  if required  fair value of a long lived asset is by its nature a highly subjective judgment 
significant assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the long term estimated cash flows 
changes in these estimates could have a material effect on the evaluation of our long lived assets 
according to accounting standards  goodwill and other intangibles are required to be evaluated whenever indicators of impairment exist and at least annually 
we conduct our annual evaluations during the fourth quarter 
the standard requires a two step process be performed to analyze whether or not goodwill has been impaired 
the first step of this test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount 
the second step  if necessary  measures the amount of the impairment 
the underlying assumptions used for determining fair value are susceptible to change from period to period and could potentially result in a material impact to the income statement 
management assumptions about future revenues and operating costs  the amount and timing of anticipated capital expenditures for power generating facilities  discount rates  inflation rates  and economic conditions  require significant judgment 
we have million in goodwill as of december   of which million relates to our black hills energy utilities 
colorado electric carries of the black hills energy goodwill 
for the colorado electric impairment analysis  we estimate the fair value of the goodwill using a discounted cash flows methodology 
this analysis requires the input of several critical assumptions in building our risk adjusted discount rate and cash flow projections including future growth rates  operating cost escalation rates  amount and timing of growth capital expenditures  timing and level of success in regulatory rate proceedings  and the cost of debt and equity capital 
we believe the goodwill amount reflects the value of the opportunity to build a significant amount of rate base generation and transmission in the next several years followed by the relatively stable  long lived cash flows of the regulated utility business  considering the regulatory environment and market growth potential 
the results of the analysis show colorado electric with a carrying value of million as of november   compared to a fair value of million 
the fair value exceeds the carrying value by  therefore we do not have an impairment 
the gas utilities carry the remaining of the black hills energy goodwill 
we tested this goodwill for impairment using an ebitda multiple method and a discounted cash flows method at each reporting unit 
the analysis required the input of several critical assumptions in determining ebitda  the multiple to apply to ebitda  cash flow projections and risk adjusted discount rate 
these assumptions include future growth rates  operating cost escalation rates  timing and level of success in regulatory rate proceedings  and long term earnings and merger multiples for comparable companies 
the results of the analysis show the gas utilities with a carrying value of million as of november   compared to a fair value of million 
the fair value exceeds the carrying value by  therefore we do not have an impairment 
full cost method of accounting for oil and gas activities accounting for oil and gas activities is subject to special  unique rules 
two generally accepted methods of accounting for oil and gas activities are available successful efforts and full cost 
we account for our oil and gas activities under the full cost method whereby all productive and nonproductive costs related to acquisition  exploration and development drilling activities are capitalized 
these costs are amortized using a unit of production method based on volumes produced and proved reserves 
any conveyances of properties  including gains or losses on abandonments of properties  are treated as adjustments to the cost of the properties with no gain or loss recognized 
net capitalized costs are subject to a ceiling test that limits such costs to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues of proved reserves and the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties 
this method values the reserves based upon sec defined prices for oil and gas as of the end of each reporting period adjusted for contracted price changes 
the prices  as well as costs and development capital  are assumed to remain constant for the remaining life of the properties 
if the net capitalized costs exceed the full cost ceiling  then a permanent non cash write down is required to be charged to earnings in that reporting period 
under these sec defined product prices  our net capitalized costs were more than the full cost ceiling at march  and december  which required a write down of million after tax and million after tax  respectively 
under the sec defined product prices at december   no additional write down was required 
reserves in and were determined consistent with sec requirements using a month average price calculated using the first day of the month price for each of the months in the reporting period held constant for the life of the properties 
given the fluctuations in natural gas and oil prices  we can provide no assurance that future write downs will not occur depending on oil and gas prices at that point in time 
oil and natural gas reserve estimates estimates of our proved oil and natural gas reserves are based on the quantities of oil and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
an independent petroleum engineering company prepares reports that estimate our proved oil and natural gas reserves annually 
the accuracy of any oil and natural gas reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
for example  we must estimate the amount and timing of future operating costs  severance taxes  development costs and workover costs  all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results 
in addition  as oil and gas prices and cost levels change from year to year  the estimate of proved reserves may also change 
any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves 
despite the inherent imprecision in estimating our oil and natural gas reserves  the estimates are used throughout our financial statements 
for example  since we use the unit of production method of calculating depletion expense  the amortization rate of our capitalized oil and gas properties incorporates the estimated unit of production attributable to the estimates of proved reserves 
the net book value of our oil and gas properties is also subject to a ceiling limitation based in large part on the quantity of our proved reserves 
finally  these reserves are the basis for our supplemental oil and gas disclosures 
risk management activities in addition to the information provided below  see note  risk management activities and note  fair value measurement  of our notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
derivatives accounting standards for derivatives require the recognition of all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and their measurement at fair value 
our policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative 
the changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized currently in earnings 
derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or fair values 
the effective portion of changes in fair values of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income loss until it is reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recorded in current earnings 
changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized in current earnings along with fair value changes of the underlying hedged item 
we currently use derivative instruments  including options  swaps  futures  forwards and other contractual commitments for both non trading hedging and trading purposes 
our typical non trading hedging transactions relate to contracts we enter into to fix the price received for anticipated future production at our oil and gas segment  or to fulfill the annual winter hedging plan for our gas utilities segment see below  and for interest rate swaps we enter into to convert a portion of our variable rate debt  or associated variable rate interest payments  to a fixed rate 
our energy marketing operations utilize various physical and financial contracts to effectively manage our marketing and trading portfolios 
fair values of derivative instruments and energy trading contracts are based on actively quoted market prices or other external source pricing information  where possible 
if external market prices are not available  fair value is determined based on other relevant factors and pricing models that consider current market and contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments or commodities  as well as time value and yield curve or volatility factors underlying the positions 
pricing models and their underlying assumptions impact the amount and timing of unrealized gains and losses recorded  and the use of different pricing models or assumptions could produce different financial results 
at our energy marketing segment  changes in the commodity markets will impact our estimates of fair value in the future 
to the extent financial contracts have extended maturity dates  our estimates of fair value may involve greater subjectivity due to the lack of transparent market data available upon which to base modeling assumptions 
a change to the estimated fair value prices would have affected net income by approximately million 
we have entered into floating to fixed interest rate swap agreements to reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
we have interest rate swaps with a notional amount of million that are not designated as hedge instruments 
accordingly  mark to market changes in value on the swaps are recorded within the income statement 
a one basis point move in the interest rate curves over the term of the swaps would have a pre tax impact of approximately million 
these swaps have remaining terms of eight and years and have amended mandatory early termination dates ranging from december  to december  counterparty credit risk and allowance for doubtful accounts our largest counterparties consist primarily of financial institutions and major energy companies 
this concentration of counterparties may materially impact our exposure to credit risk resulting from market  economic or regulatory conditions 
we seek to minimize counterparty credit risk through an evaluation of their financial condition and credit ratings and by imposing collateral requirements under certain circumstances  including the use of master netting agreements in our energy marketing segment 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issue that we have identified 
the allowances provided are estimated and may be impacted by economic  market and regulatory conditions  which could have an effect on future allowance requirements and significantly impact future results of operations 
while most credit losses have historically been within our expectations and established provisions  we can provide no assurance that our actual credit losses will be consistent with our estimates 
pension and other postretirement benefits the company  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k  has three defined benefit pension plans and three defined post retirement healthcare plans 
accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations involves numerous assumptions  the most significant of which relate to the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations  expected long term rates of return on plan assets  rate of future increases in compensation levels  and healthcare cost projections 
the determination of our obligation and expenses for pension and other postretirement benefits is dependent on the assumptions used by actuaries in calculating the amounts 
although we believe our assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and our future expense 
the pension benefit cost for for our non contributory funded pension plan is expected to be million compared to million in the estimated discount rate used to determine annual benefit cost accruals will be in  the discount rate used in was 
in selecting the discount rate  we consider cash flow durations for each plan liabilities and returns on high credit quality fixed income yield curves for comparable durations 
our pension plan assets are held in trust and consist of equity  fixed income and real estate securities 
in  our target long term investment allocations were equity and fixed income 
at december   our investment allocation was equities  fixed income cash and real estate 
we do not pre fund our non qualified pension plans or two of the three postretirement benefit plans 
the table below shows the expected impacts of a increase or decrease to our healthcare trend rate for our retiree healthcare plans in thousands change in assumed trend rate impact on december  accumulated postretirement benefit obligation impact on service and interest cost increase decrease contingencies when it is probable that an environmental or other legal liability has been incurred  a loss is recognized when the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
estimates of the probability and the amount of loss are made based on currently available facts 
accounting for contingencies requires significant judgment regarding the estimated probabilities and ranges of exposure to potential liability 
our assessment of our exposure to contingencies could change to the extent there are additional future developments  or as more information becomes available 
if actual obligations incurred are different from our estimates  the recognition of the actual amounts could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
valuation of deferred tax assets we use the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred income taxes are recognized  at currently enacted income tax rates  to reflect the tax effect of temporary differences between the financial and tax basis of assets and liabilities  as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the amount of deferred tax assets recognized is limited to the amount of the benefit that is more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the realization of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and provides any necessary valuation allowances as required 
if we determine that we will be unable to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
although we believe our assumptions  judgments and estimates are reasonable  changes in tax laws or our interpretations of tax laws and the resolution of current and any future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources overview information about our financial position as of december is presented in the following table dollars  in thousands financial position summary percentage change cash and cash equivalents restricted cash short term debt  including current maturities of long term debt long term debt stockholders equity ratios long term debt ratio total debt ratio we believe that our cash on hand  operating cash flows  existing borrowing capacity and ability to complete new debt and equity financings  taken as a whole  provide sufficient resources to fund our ongoing operating requirements  debt maturities  anticipated dividends  and anticipated capital expenditures during the next twelve months 
liquidity historically  our principal sources of short term liquidity have been our revolving credit facilities and cash from operations 
we have utilized availability under our revolving credit facilities to manage our cash flow needs  which are affected by the seasonality of our businesses 
our principal sources for our long term capital needs have been proceeds raised from public and private offerings of equity and long term debt securities issued by the company and its subsidiaries 
we have also managed liquidity needs through hedging activities  primarily in connection with seasonal needs of our utility operations including seasonal peaks in fuel requirements  interest rate movements  and commodity price movements 
at december   we had approximately million of unrestricted cash on hand in addition to availability under our credit facilities 
we had the following borrowings  outstanding letters of credit and available capacity in millions credit facility expiration maximum capacity borrowings at december  letters of credit at december  available capacity at december  revolving credit facility april  enserco facility may  working capital the most significant items impacting working capital are our capital expenditures  the purchase of natural gas for our regulated gas utilities  payment of dividends to shareholders and funding energy marketing activities 
we could experience significant working capital requirements during peak months of the winter heating season due to higher natural gas consumption and during periods of high natural gas prices 
we anticipate using a combination of credit capacity available under our corporate revolver and cash on hand to meet our peak winter working capital requirements 
our energy marketing segment engages in trading activities which carry working capital requirements  notably natural gas storage 
the level of these requirements varies depending on market circumstances  marketing activities and counterparty liquidity requirements 
in addition  enserco credit facility contains working capital requirements for each borrowing base election level 
credit facilities and long term debt revolving credit facility on april   we terminated our million corporate credit facility and entered into a new million revolving credit facility expiring april  the new facility contains an accordion feature which allows us  with the consent of the administrative agent  to increase the capacity of the new facility to million and can be used for the issuance of letters of credit  to fund working capital needs and for other corporate purposes 
borrowings are available under a base rate option or a eurodollar option 
the cost of borrowings or letters of credit is determined based upon our credit ratings 
at current ratings levels  the margins for base rate borrowings  eurodollar borrowings and letters of credit are  and  respectively at december  the new facility contains a commitment fee to be charged on the unused amount of the revolving credit facility 
based upon current credit ratings  the fee is 
the revolving credit facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants  such as limitations on the creation of new indebtedness and on certain liens  restrictions on certain transactions  and maintenance of the following financial covenants i consolidated net worth in an amount of not less than the sum of million and of our aggregate consolidated net income  if positive  beginning january  and ii a recourse leverage ratio not to exceed to 
subject to applicable cure periods  a violation of any of these covenants would constitute an event of default that entitles the lenders to terminate their remaining commitments and accelerate all principal and interest outstanding 
we were in compliance with the covenants at december  our consolidated net worth was  million at december   which was approximately million in excess of the net worth we were required to maintain under the credit facility 
at december   our long term debt ratio was  our total debt leverage ratio long term debt and short term debt was  and our recourse leverage ratio was approximately 
our ratios are calculated as required under the revolving credit facility 
our consolidated net worth requirement is calculated by taking million plus of the net income  if positive  of the company since january  our long term debt ratio is the ratio of our long term debt over long term debt plus our net worth 
our total debt leverage ratio is the same as our long term debt ratio with the addition of current maturities of long term debt and notes payable in the calculation 
our recourse leverage ratio is the ratio of our recourse debt  letters of credit except letters of credit issued by our marketing subsidiary up to million and guarantees issued over our total capital which includes the balance in the numerator plus our net worth 
in addition to covenant violations  an event of default under the credit facility may be triggered by other events  such as a failure to make payments when due or a failure to make payments when due in respect of  or a failure to perform obligations relating to  other debt obligations of million or more 
subject to applicable cure periods none of which apply to a failure to timely pay indebtedness  an event of default would permit the lenders to restrict our ability to further access the credit facility for loans or new letters of credit  and could require both the immediate repayment of any principal and interest outstanding and the cash collateralization of outstanding letter of credit obligations 
the credit facility prohibits us from paying cash dividends if a default or an event of default exists prior to  or would result after giving effect to such action 
enserco credit facility in may  enserco entered into an agreement for a two year  million committed credit facility 
the facility includes a million accordion feature which allows enserco  with the consent of the administrative agent  to increase commitments under the facility

this enserco credit facility replaced the million credit facility which expired on may  maximum borrowings under the facility are subject to a sublimit of million 
borrowings under this facility are available under a base rate option or a eurodollar option 
margins for base rate borrowings are and for eurodollar borrowings are 
enserco was in compliance with its covenants as of december  in september  the enserco credit facility was amended to allow for trading of electric power  renewable energy credits and emissions credits 
corporate term loan in december  we entered into a million one year term loan the loan with jp morgan and union bank due in december the cost of the borrowings under the loan is based on a spread of basis points over libor which equates to at december

interest rate swaps we have entered into floating to fixed interest rate swap agreements to reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
we have interest rate swaps with a notional amount of million that are not designated as hedge instruments 
accordingly  mark to market changes in value on the swaps are recorded within the income statement 
for the year ended december   we recorded a million pre tax unrealized mark to market non cash loss on the swaps 
for the year ended december   we recorded a million pre tax unrealized mark to market non cash gain on the swaps 
the mark to market value on these swaps was a liability of million at december  subsequent mark to market adjustments could have a significant impact on our results of operations 
a one basis point move in the interest rate curve over the term of the swaps would have a pre tax impact of approximately million 
these swaps are for terms of eight and years and have amended mandatory early termination dates ranging from december  to december  we have continued to maintain these swaps in anticipation of our upcoming financing needs  particularly our upcoming holding company debt maturities  which are million and million in years and  respectively 
alternatively  we may choose to cash settle these swaps at their fair value prior to their mandatory early termination dates  or unless these dates are extended  we will cash settle these swaps for an amount equal to their fair value on the stated termination dates 
in addition  we have million notional amount floating to fixed interest rate swaps  having a maximum term of years 
these swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges and accordingly  their mark to market adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the mark to market value of these swaps was a liability of million at december  cross default provisions our revolving credit facility contains cross default provisions that would result in an event of default under the credit facility upon i a failure by us or certain of our subsidiaries including  among others  enserco and most of our utility subsidiaries to timely pay indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount of million or more  or ii the occurrence of a default under any agreement under which we or certain of our subsidiaries including  among others  enserco and most of our utility subsidiaries may incur indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount of million or more  and such default continues for a period of time sufficient to permit an acceleration of the maturity of such indebtedness or a mandatory prepayment of such indebtedness 
in addition  our revolving credit facility contains default provisions under which an event of default would result if we or certain of our subsidiaries including  among others  enserco and most of our utility subsidiaries fail to timely make certain payments  such as erisa funding obligations or payments in satisfaction of judgments  in an aggregate principal amount of million or more 
forward equity transaction in november  we entered into a forward agreement with jp morgan in connection with a public offering of  shares of black hills corporation common stock 
under the forward agreement on november   we agreed to issue to jp morgan  shares of our common stock at an initial forward price of per share 
on december   the underwriters exercised the over allotment option to purchase an additional  shares 
in conjunction with the underwriters exercise of the  share over allotment option  an additional equity forward agreement was entered into with jp morgan for the over allotment shares  having the same terms as the original forward agreement together with the forward agreement  the forward agreements 
the forward price used to determine cash proceeds due black hills corporation at settlement of the equity forward instruments will be calculated based on the november public offering price of our common stock of per share  adjusted for underwriting fees  interest rate adjustments as specified in the forward agreement  and expected dividends on our common stock during the period the instrument is outstanding 
we may settle the equity forward instrument at any time up to the maturity date of november  we may also unilaterally elect to cash or net share settle at any date up to maturity  for all or a portion of the equity forward shares 
the equity forward instrument held by jp morgan  underlying the forward agreements  was accounted for as equity in accordance with accounting for derivatives and hedging contracts in entity own equity  and recorded at fair value at the execution of the forward agreements  and will not be subsequently adjusted for changes in fair value until settlement 
since the initial pricing of the equity forward instrument of per share was determined based on the november offering price of our common stock of per share  less underwriting fees of per share  no premium on the transaction was due jp morgan related to the forward agreements at execution  and no fair value was recorded to equity for the instrument 
proceeds or payments due at settlement of all or portions of the equity forward instrument will be recorded with appropriate adjustments to additional paid in capital and common stock  depending on the method of settlement 
at december   the equity forward instrument could have been settled with physical delivery of  shares to jp morgan in exchange for cash of million 
assuming required notices were given and actions taken  the forward instruments could have also been cash or net settled at december  with respective delivery of cash of approximately million or approximately  shares of common stock to jp morgan 
the use of a forward sale agreement allowed us to avoid equity market uncertainty by pricing a stock offering under the current market conditions  while mitigating share dilution by postponing the issuance of stock until funds are needed 
underwriting discount fees totaled million which will be deducted from the proceeds upon settlement 
collateral we had posted with counterparties the following amounts of collateral in the form of cash or letters of credit at december in thousands trading positions energy marketing utility cash collateral requirements letters of credit on revolving credit facility total funds on deposit collateral requirements for our trading positions will fluctuate based on the movement in commodity prices and our credit rating 
changes in collateral requirements will vary depending on the magnitude of the price movement and the current position of our energy marketing trading portfolio 
as these trading positions settle in the future  the collateral will be returned 
at our gas utilities and energy marketing segments  we are required to post collateral with certain commodity and pipeline transportation vendors 
this amount will fluctuate depending on gas prices and projected volumetric deliveries 
utility money pool as a utility holding company  we are required to establish a cash management program to address lending and borrowing activities between our utility subsidiaries and the company 
we have established utility money pool agreements which address these requirements 
these agreements are on file with the ferc and appropriate state regulators 
under the utility money pool agreements  our utilities may at their option borrow and extend short term loans to our other utilities via a utility money pool at market based rates at december  
while the utility money pool may borrow funds from the company as ultimate parent company  the money pool arrangement does not allow loans from our utility subsidiaries to the company as ultimate parent company or to non regulated affiliates 
at december money pool balances included in thousands borrowings from loans to money pool outstanding subsidiary black hills utility holdings black hills power cheyenne light total money pool borrowings from parent registration statements the company has an effective automatic shelf registration statement on file with the sec under which we may issue  from time to time  senior debt securities  subordinated debt securities  common stock  preferred stock  warrants and other securities 
although the shelf registration statement does not limit our issuance capacity  our ability to issue securities is limited to the authority granted by our board of directors  certain covenants in our finance arrangements and restrictions imposed by federal and state regulatory authorities 
our current automatic shelf registration expires on may  our articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of million shares of common stock  par value  and million shares of preferred stock  no par value 
as of december   we had approximately million shares of common stock outstanding  and no shares of preferred stock outstanding 
in addition  pursuant to the forward agreements  we expect to issue an additional  shares of common stock on or prior to the november  maturity date 
anticipated financing plans we have substantial capital expenditures projected in  primarily due to the construction of additional utility and ipp generation to serve our colorado electric utility 
our capital requirements are expected to be financed through a combination of operating cash flows  borrowings on our revolving credit facility and long term financings 
we may complete an additional long term senior unsecured debt financing at the holding company level in we intend to maintain a consolidated debt to capitalization level in the range of to  however  during the construction period of our new generation facilities in colorado  we may exceed this level on a temporary basis 
we expect to complete a portion of the permanent financing through the settlement of the forward equity agreement in order to maintain our target debt to capitalization level 
we do not currently anticipate any difficulty accessing debt or equity markets 
factors influencing liquidity many of our operations are subject to seasonal and market driven fluctuations in cash flow 
we have traditionally sourced variations in the working capital needs of our subsidiaries with cash on hand and capacity available under our credit facilities  and have sourced the capital expenditures of our subsidiaries through a combination of internally generated cash  equity contributions and borrowings by our subsidiaries from us financed primarily with net proceeds of equity and long term debt issuances by us and  in limited instances  debt offerings by our subsidiaries 
increased volatility in commodity prices and interest rates has led to increased variability in our liquidity needs 
as a utility holding company which owns several regulated utilities  we are subject to various regulations that could influence our liquidity 
for example  the issuance of debt by our utility subsidiaries including the ability of black hills utility holdings to issue debt and the use of our utility assets as collateral generally requires the prior approval of the state regulators in the state in which the utility assets are located 
as a result of our holding company structure  our right as a common shareholder  to receive assets of any of our direct or indirect subsidiaries upon a subsidiary liquidation or reorganization  is junior to the claims against the assets of such subsidiaries by their creditors 
therefore  our holding company debt obligations are effectively subordinated to all existing and future claims of the creditors of our subsidiaries  including trade creditors  debt holders  secured creditors  taxing authorities  and guarantee holders 
due to market conditions  the funding status of our pension plans is subject to multiple variables  many of which are beyond our control  including changes to the fair value of the pension assets and changes in actuarial assumptions in particular  the discount rate used in determining the projected benefit obligation 
as a result  we may be required to contribute material amounts to our pension plans in and future periods  which could materially affect our liquidity and results of operations 
dividend restrictions due to our holding company structure  substantially all of our operating cash flows are provided by dividends paid or distributions made by our subsidiaries 
the cash to pay dividends to our shareholders is derived from these cash flows 
as a result of certain statutory limitations or regulatory or financing agreements  we could have restrictions on the amount of distributions allowed to be made by our subsidiaries 
our credit facilities and other debt obligations contain restrictions on the payment of cash dividends upon a default or event of default 
an event of default would be deemed to have occurred if we did not meet certain financial covenants 
the most restrictive financial covenants of our revolving credit facility include the following a recourse leverage ratio not to exceed to and a minimum consolidated net worth of million plus of aggregate consolidated net income since january  as of december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
in connection with the aquila transaction  the cpuc  npsc  iub and kcc approved orders or settlement agreements providing that  among other things  i our utilities in those jurisdictions cannot pay dividends if they have issued debt to third parties and the payment of a dividend would reduce their equity ratio to below of their total capitalization  and ii neither black hills utility holdings nor its utility subsidiaries can extend credit to the company except in the ordinary course of business and upon reasonable terms consistent with market terms 
covenants within cheyenne light financing agreements require cheyenne light to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio of no more than to 
in addition to the restrictions described above  each state in which we conduct utility operations imposes restrictions on affiliate transactions  including inter company loans 
additionally  our utility subsidiaries are generally limited to the amount of dividends allowed by state regulatory authorities to be paid to us as a utility holding company and also may have further restrictions under the federal power act

market risk disclosures our activities expose us to a number of risks in the normal operation of our businesses 
depending on the activity  we are exposed to varying degrees of market risk and counterparty risk 
we have developed policies  processes  systems  and controls to manage and mitigate these risks 
market risk is the potential loss that might occur as a result of an adverse change in market price or rate 
we are exposed to the following market risks commodity price risk associated with our marketing business  our natural long position with crude oil and natural gas reserves and production  and fuel procurement for certain of our gas fired generation assets  interest rate risk associated with our variable rate credit facilities and our project financing floating rate debt as described in notes and of our notes to consolidated financial statements  and foreign currency exchange risk associated with our natural gas marketing business transacted in canadian dollars 
our exposure to these market risks is affected by a number of factors including the size  duration  and composition of our energy portfolio  the absolute and relative levels of interest rates  currency exchange rates and commodity prices  the volatility of these prices and rates  and the liquidity of the related interest rate and commodity markets 
to manage and mitigate these identified risks  we have adopted the black hills corporation risk policies and procedures 
these policies have been approved by our executive risk committee and reviewed by the audit committee of our board of directors 
these policies relate to numerous matters including governance  control infrastructure  authorized commodities and trading instruments  prohibited activities  and employee conduct 
the executive risk committee  which includes senior level executives  meets on a regular basis to review our business and credit activities and to ensure that these activities are conducted within the authorized policies 
utilities we produce  purchase and distribute power in four states  and purchase and distribute natural gas in five states 
all of our gas distribution utilities have pga provisions that allow them to pass the prudently incurred cost of gas through to the customer 
to the extent that gas prices are higher or lower than amounts in our current billing rates  adjustments are made on a periodic basis to true up billed amounts to match the actual natural gas cost we incurred 
these adjustments are subject to periodic prudence reviews by the state utility commissions 
in south dakota  colorado  wyoming and montana  we have a mechanism for our regulated electric utilities that serves a purpose similar to the pgas for our regulated gas utilities 
to the extent that our fuel and purchased power energy costs are higher or lower than the energy cost built into our tariffs  the difference or a portion thereof is passed through to the customer 
as allowed or required by state utility commissions  we have entered into certain exchange traded natural gas futures  options and basis swaps to reduce our customers underlying exposure to volatility of natural gas prices 
these transactions are considered derivatives and are marked to market 
gains or losses  as well as option premiums on these transactions  are recorded in regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities 
the fair value of our gas utilities derivative contracts are summarized below in thousands december  december  net derivative liabilities cash collateral trading activities energy marketing we have a natural gas  crude oil  coal  power and environmental marketing business specializing in producer services  end use origination and wholesale marketing that conducts business in the united states and canada 
for producer services our main objective is to provide value in the supply chain by acting as the producer marketing arm for wellhead purchases  scheduling services  imbalance management  risk management services and transportation management 
we accomplish this goal through industry experience  extensive contacts  transportation and risk management expertise  trading skills and personal attention 
our end use origination efforts focus on supplying and providing electricity generators and industrial customers with flexible options to procure their energy inputs and asset optimization services to these large end use consumers of natural gas 
our wholesale marketing activity has two functions support the efforts of producer services and end use origination groups  and marketing and trading natural gas  crude oil  coal  power and environmental products 
to effectively manage our producer services  end use origination and wholesale marketing portfolios  we enter into forward physical commodity contracts  financial derivative instruments including over the counter swaps and options  and storage and transportation agreements 
we conduct our energy marketing business activities within the parameters as defined and allowed in the bhcrpp and further delineated in the energy marketing risk management policies and procedures as approved by our executive risk committee 
monitoring and reporting market risk exposures we use a number of quantitative tools to measure  monitor and limit our exposure to market risk in our natural gas  oil  coal  power and environmental marketing portfolio 
we limit and monitor our market risk through established limits on the nominal size of positions based on type of trade  location and duration 
such limits include those on fixed price  basis  index  storage  transportation and foreign exchange positions 
our market risk limits are monitored by our risk management function to ensure compliance with our stated risk limits 
the risk management function operates independently from our energy marketing group 
the limits are measured  monitored and regularly reported to and reviewed by our executive risk committee 
daily risk management activities include reviewing positions in relation to established position limits  assessing changes in daily mark to market and other non statistical risk management techniques 
the contract or notional amounts  terms and mark to market values of our natural gas  crude oil  coal  emissions credits and energy marketing and derivative commodity instruments at december  and  are set forth in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
fair value of energy marketing positions the following table provides a reconciliation of activity in our marketing portfolio that has been recorded at fair value in accordance with gaap during the year ended december  in thousands total fair value of energy marketing positions marked to market at december  a net cash settled during the period on positions that existed at december  change in fair value due to change in assumptions unrealized gain on new positions entered during the period and still existing at december  realized gain on positions that existed at december  and were settled during the period change in cash collateral unrealized loss on positions that existed at december  and still exist at december  total fair value of energy marketing positions at december  a a the fair value of energy marketing positions consists of the mark to market values of derivative assets liabilities and market value adjustments to natural gas inventory that has been designated as a hedged item as part of a fair value hedge  as follows in thousands december  december  net derivative assets cash collateral market adjustment recorded in material  supplies and fuel total fair value of energy marketing positions marked to market to value the assets and liabilities for our outstanding derivative contracts  we use the fair value methodology outlined in accounting standards for fair value measurements and disclosures 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
the sources of fair value measurements were as follows in thousands maturities source of fair value less than year years total fair value level level level cash collateral market value adjustment for inventory see footnote a above total fair value of our energy marketing positions gaap restricts mark to market accounting treatment primarily to those contracts that meet the definition of a derivative under accounting standards for derivatives and hedges 
therefore  the above reconciliation does not present a complete picture of our overall portfolio of trading activities or our expected cash flows from energy trading activities 
in our marketing operations  we often employ strategies that include utilizing derivative contracts along with inventory  storage and transportation positions to accomplish the objectives of our marketing groups 
except in circumstances when we are able to designate transportation  storage or inventory positions as part of a fair value hedge  accounting standards for derivatives generally do not allow us to mark our inventory  transportation or storage positions to market 
the result is that while a significant majority of our energy marketing positions are fully economically hedged  we are required to mark some parts of our overall strategies the derivatives to market value  but are generally precluded from marking the rest of our economic hedges transportation  inventory or storage to market 
volatility in reported earnings and derivative positions should be expected given these accounting requirements 
the table below references non gaap measures that quantify these positions 
the following table presents a reconciliation of our energy marketing positions recorded at fair value under gaap to a non gaap measure of the fair value of our energy marketing forward book wherein all forward trading positions are marked to market in thousands december  december  fair value of our energy marketing positions marked to market in accordance with gaap see footnote a above market value adjustments for inventory  storage and transportation positions that are not marked to market under gaap fair value of all forward positions non gaap cash collateral included in gaap fair value fair value of all forward positions excluding cash collateral non gaap we consider this measure a non gaap financial measure 
this measure is presented because we believe it provides a more comprehensive view to our investors of our energy trading activities and thus a better understanding of these activities than would be presented by the gaap measure alone 
activities other than trading oil and gas exploration and production we produce natural gas and crude oil through our exploration and production activities 
our reserves are natural long positions  or unhedged open positions  and introduce commodity price risk and variability in our cash flows 
we employ risk management methods to mitigate this commodity price risk and preserve our cash flows 
we have adopted guidelines covering hedging for our natural gas and crude oil production 
these guidelines have been approved by our board of directors 
to mitigate commodity price risk and preserve cash flows  we primarily use over the counter swaps and options 
our hedging policy allows up to of our natural gas and of our crude oil production from proven producing reserves to be hedged for a period up to two years in the future 
our hedging strategy is conducted from an enterprise wide risk perspective  accordingly  we might not externally hedge a portion of our natural gas production when we have offsetting price risk for the fuel requirements of certain of our power generating activities 
the company has entered into agreements to hedge a portion of its estimated and natural gas and crude oil production 
the hedge agreements in place as of december  are as follows natural gas location transaction date hedge type term volume mmbtu day price cig swap nwr swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap aeco swap san juan el paso swap aeco swap nwr swap san juan el paso swap cig swap cig swap nwr swap san juan el paso swap cig swap nwr swap aeco swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap nwr swap san juan el paso swap aeco swap cig swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap nwr swap aeco swap cig swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap san juan el paso swap cig swap nwr swap aeco swap san juan el paso swap nwr swap cig swap crude oil location transaction date hedge type term volume bbls month price nymex swap nymex swap nymex swap nymex swap nymex swap nymex swap nymex swap nymex put nymex swap nymex put nymex swap nymex put nymex swap nymex put nymex swap nymex swap nymex swap nymex put nymex put nymex swap nymex swap nymex swap nymex swap nymex put nymex swap nymex swap nymex swap nymex swap nymex swap nymex swap the hedge agreements entered into by the company as of december  had a fair value of approximately million as of december  wholesale power a potential risk related to power sales is the price risk arising from the sale of wholesale power that exceeds our generating capacity 
these short positions can arise from unplanned plant outages or from unanticipated load demands 
to control such risk  we restrict wholesale off system sales to amounts by which our anticipated generating capabilities and purchased power resources exceed our anticipated load requirements plus a required reserve margin 
financing activities we engage in activities to manage risks associated with changes in interest rates 
we have entered into floating to fixed interest rate swap agreements to reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations associated with our floating rate debt obligations 
at december   we had million of notional amount floating to fixed interest rate swaps  having a maximum term of years 
these swaps have been designated as hedges in accordance with accounting standards for derivatives and hedges and accordingly their mark to market adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheet 
we also have interest rate swaps with a notional amount of million which were entered into for the purpose of hedging interest rate movements that would impact long term financings that were originally expected to occur in the swaps were originally designated as cash flow hedges and the mark to market value was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheet 
based on credit market conditions that transpired during the fourth quarter of  we determined it was probable that the forecasted long term debt financings would not occur in the time period originally specified and as a result  the swaps were no longer effective hedges and the hedge relationships were de designated 
mark to market adjustments on the swaps are now recorded within the income statement and during we recorded a million pre tax unrealized mark to market loss  in we recorded a million pre tax unrealized mark to market gain to earnings  while in we recorded a million pre tax unrealized mark to market charge to earnings 
these swaps are eight and year swaps which have amended mandatory early termination dates ranging from december  to december  we have continued to maintain these swaps in anticipation of our upcoming financing needs  particularly our upcoming holding company debt maturities  which are million and million in years and  respectively 
alternatively  we may choose to cash settle these swaps at their fair value prior to their mandatory early termination dates  or unless these dates are extended  we will cash settle these swaps for an amount equal to their fair value on the stated termination dates 
further details of the swap agreements are set forth in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
on december  and  our interest rate swaps and related balances were as follows dollars in thousands december  notional weighted average fixed interest rate maximum terms in years current assets non current assets current liabilities non current liabilities pre tax accumulated other comprehensive income loss pre tax income loss interest rate swaps interest rate swaps december  interest rate swaps interest rate swaps based on december  market interest rates and balances  a loss of approximately million would be realized and reported in pre tax earnings during the next twelve months 
estimated and realized losses will likely change during the next twelve months as market interest rates change 
the table below presents principal or notional amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our long term debt obligations  including current maturities dollars in thousands thereafter total long term debt fixed rate a average interest rate variable rate average interest rate total long term debt average interest rate a excludes unamortized premium or discount 
credit risk credit risk is the risk of financial loss resulting from non performance of contractual obligations by a counterparty 
we have adopted the black hills corporation credit policy that establishes guidelines  controls  and limits to manage and mitigate credit risk within risk tolerances established by the board of directors 
in addition  our executive credit committee  which includes senior executives  meets on a regular basis to review our credit activities and to monitor compliance with the adopted policies 
for our energy marketing  production  and generation activities  we seek to mitigate our credit risk by conducting a majority of our business with investment grade companies  setting tenor and credit limits commensurate with counterparty financial strength  obtaining netting agreements  and securing our credit exposure with less creditworthy counterparties through parental guarantees  prepayments  letters of credit  and other security agreements 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer current creditworthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issue that we have identified 
while most credit losses have historically been within our expectations and provisions established  we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past  or that an investment grade counterparty will not default sometime in the future 
at december   approximately of our credit exposure exclusive of retail customers of our regulated utilities was with investment grade companies 
the remaining credit exposure is with non investment grade or non rated counterparties  of which a portion was supported through letters of credit  prepayments  or parental guarantees 
foreign exchange contracts our energy marketing subsidiary conducts its business in the united states and canada 
transactions in canada are generally transacted in canadian dollars  which creates exchange rate risk 
to mitigate this risk  we enter into forward currency exchange contracts to offset earnings volatility from changes in exchange rates between the canadian and united states dollars 
at december   we had outstanding forward exchange contracts to purchase approximately million canadian dollars 
these contracts had a fair value of million at december  at december   we had no outstanding forward exchange contracts
