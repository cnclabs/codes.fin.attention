item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis has been prepared with reference to the historical financial condition and results of operations of air transport services group  inc  and its subsidiaries and should be read in conjunction with the risk factors in item a of this report  our historical financial statements  and the related notes contained in this report 
introduction air transport services group  inc the company is a holding company whose principal subsidiaries include three independently certificated airlines  abx air  inc abx  capital cargo international airlines  inc ccia and air transport international  llc ati  and an aircraft leasing company  cargo aircraft management  inc cam 
when the context requires  we may also use the terms company and atsg in this report to refer to the business of atsg and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis 
the company  through abx  has had long term contracts with dhl network operations usa  inc and its affiliates  which are collectively referred to as dhl  since august  dhl  an international  integrated delivery company  is the company largest customer 
in march  the company and dhl executed new follow on agreements  effective march  the new agreements separate cam lease of freighter aircraft to dhl from the maintenance and operation of those aircraft on behalf of dhl 
dhl committed to lease boeing freighter aircraft from cam and dhl contracted with abx to operate those aircraft under a separate crew  maintenance and insurance cmi agreement 
the cmi agreement is no longer based on a cost plus pricing arrangement  but instead pricing is based on a pre defined fee  scaled for the number of aircraft operated and the number of flight crews provided to dhl for its us network 
the initial term of the cmi agreement is five years  while the term of the aircraft leases are seven years  with early termination provisions 
until cam completes the aircraft modification process for the aircraft committed to dhl  abx is operating its own boeing aircraft as bridging aircraft for dhl under short term  month to month arrangements under economic terms similar to those under the lease agreements for the aircraft 
prior to the new follow on agreements  abx provided flight crews  maintenance and aircraft to dhl under an aircraft  crew  maintenance and insurance agreement dhl acmi agreement which compensated abx on a cost plus mark up basis 
the new follow on agreements with dhl commenced on march  due to the similarities among the company airline operations  including the new cmi agreement with dhl  the airline operations have been aggregated into a single reportable segment 
the segment information has been updated to retrospectively reflect the aggregation of the former dhl segment with the acmi services segment 
segment analysis the company has two reportable segments acmi services and cam 
the company s other business activities do not constitute reportable segments and have been aggregated in other activities 

table of contents a summary of our revenues and pre tax earnings from continuing operations is shown below in thousands years ended december revenues from continuing operations cam acmi services airline services other reimbursable s r activites total acmi services other activities total revenues eliminate internal revenues customer revenues pre tax earnings from continuing operations cam  inclusive of interest expense acmi services airline services s r activites impairments total acmi services other activities net unallocated interest expense total pre tax earnings from continuing operations under a severance and retention agreement s r agreement  dhl compensated and reimbursed abx for its management and costs associated with dhl network restructuring starting in may and continuing through march other reimbursable revenues include certain operating costs that are reimbursed to the airlines by their customers 
such costs include fuel used  landing fees and certain aircraft maintenance expenses 
the type of costs that are reimbursed varies by customer operating agreement 
cam the company offers aircraft leasing through its cam subsidiary 
aircraft leases normally cover a term of five to seven years 
in a typical leasing agreement  customers pay rent and a maintenance deposit on a monthly basis 
since december   cam has completed the modification of six boeing aircraft into standard cargo configuration and acquired twelve other boeing freighter aircraft from abx 
as of december   cam had aircraft that were under lease  of them to abx  ati and ccia 
cam revenues from abx  ati and ccia were million and million for and  respectively 
cam revenues for grew million to million compared to million in revenues from external customers  particularly dhl  accounted for million of the increase 
in april  as part of the follow on agreements with dhl  cam placed seven boeing aircraft under lease with dhl 
these seven aircraft were previously associated with the dhl network and were reflected in the acmi services segment revenues prior to april  by the end of  cam leased four additional boeing aircraft to dhl  bringing the total number of aircraft leased to dhl to eleven 
at this time  cam does not expect to have all boeing freighter aircraft available for lease to dhl until the second quarter of accordingly  abx is operating two of its aircraft for dhl under short term  month to month bridging arrangements with economic terms similar to the 
table of contents leases for the aircraft until cam completes the aircraft modification process in for the remaining two boeing aircraft committed to dhl 
in addition to the eleven leases with dhl in  cam placed two boeing freighter aircraft under lease to a florida based operator in february and july  bringing the total number of external aircraft leases to pre tax segment earnings for cam were million for and million in the increase in pre tax earnings reflects additional aircraft that cam has placed in service since december   of them to external customers 
cam s results reflected an allocation of overhead expenses and interest expense based on the company external interest rates and the carrying value of cam operating assets 
interest expense allocated to cam was million and million in and  respectively 
outlook we plan to continue to invest in the modification of boeing aircraft 
the fuel efficiency  cubic capacity  payload and operating costs of the boeing make it a desirable freighter aircraft in medium range international air cargo markets and in trans us routes 
interest in efficient  reliable boeing aircraft remains strong 
as of december   two of cam non standard boeing freighter aircraft were undergoing modification to standard freighter configuration by israel aerospace industries  ltd 
iai 
currently  we plan to modify all four of the remaining non standard boeing freighter aircraft that we own into a standard freighter configuration 
the aircraft are scheduled for the modification process through september of at iai 
we will consider a number of factors  including the fleet plans of customers  long term demand for airlift  the quantity and quality of customer prospects  competitive alternatives and general economic conditions before deciding to place an aircraft into the modification process 
if a non standard boeing freighter aircraft is not placed into the modification process  we will consider other alternatives  including the sale of the aircraft or the salvaging and parting out of the aircraft to support the company s other boeing aircraft 

in may  cam entered into a purchase agreement for three passenger configured boeing extended range aircraft  each equipped with general electric cf c b engines 
on august   cam entered into an agreement with m b conversions limited and iai for the conversion by iai of the three boeing series passenger aircraft to a full freighter configuration 
the agreement includes an option to convert up to seven additional boeing series passenger aircraft during the year term of the agreement 
the company plans to modify the aircraft into standard freighter configuration 
as of december   one boeing aircraft was undergoing freighter modification 
in october  cam entered an agreement with precision conversions  llc precision for the design  engineering and certification of a boeing combi aircraft variant 
the boeing combi variant to be developed by precision will incorporate full cargo pallet positions along with passenger seating for up to occupants 
the boeing combi is intended to strategically position cam to provide next generation combi aircraft to complement and eventually replace  the dc combi aircraft that ati operates for the us military 
if the military decides not to transition to the combi in the near future  we have the option to convert boeing aircraft to standard freighter aircraft instead 
cam is committed to convert a minimum of two boeing aircraft with precision 
besides the passenger aircraft that were undergoing freighter modification at december   cam owned one passenger aircraft  a boeing extended range aircraft  that is scheduled for operation in april acmi services segment through its three airline subsidiaries  the company provides airlift to other airlines  freight forwarders and the us military 
in addition to dhl  bax global  inc bax schenker and the us military are also significant customers 
ccia and ati each have airline operating agreements with bax schenker 
dhl  bax schenker and the us military account for of acmi services revenues 
at december   acmi services included in service aircraft which the company owned or leased 
additionally  acmi services included the results from operations by abx of eleven cam owned freighter aircraft for dhl under the cmi agreement by the end of in the fourth quarter of  abx began to lease and operate two dhl owned boeing aircraft under the cmi agreement 
beginning in november  abx began to lease a boeing aircraft from an external lessor for a month period 
abx is operating the boeing 
table of contents under an acmi agreement with dhl for a transatlantic flight 
also in november  abx began to operate one of its boeing aircraft in asia under an agreement with japan airlines international co  ltd 
and dhl 
during  ati leased its third boeing cargo aircraft  while ccia redeployed one of its leased boeing aircraft that had been temporarily unassigned and scrapped a boeing airframe  permanently removing it from service 
during  abx returned one of its leased boeing aircraft to cam  which then leased the aircraft to an external customer under a seven year agreement 
acmi services revenues were million during  declining million compared to revenues generated from dhl us network declined million compared to  when those revenues included the reimbursement of employee severance and retention benefits and aircraft depreciation expense  as well as compensation from dhl for a larger us air network 
beginning april   certain aircraft that abx had been operating for dhl under the former dhl acmi agreement were instead leased to dhl through cam as part of the new follow on agreements and the lease revenues began being reflected in cam revenues 
under a severance and retention agreement s r agreement which was terminated and settled on march   dhl was obligated to reimburse abx for the cost of employee severance  retention  productivity bonuses and vacation benefits paid in accordance with the agreement 
revenues from the s r agreement declined million in compared to the reduction in revenues includes a reduction in the reimbursement of severance and retention benefits since  when abx experienced significant employee terminations 
the decline in revenues from the s r agreement was partially offset by increased block hours flown for customers in europe  asia pacific and the caribbean 
block hours increased to  hours during compared to the pre tax earnings for acmi services were million for  compared to pre tax earnings of million during pre tax earnings included million and million for and  respectively  for administering the wind down of the dhl operations under the s r agreement which was terminated on march  acmi services pre tax earnings from airline services increased to million for compared to million for higher pre tax earnings in from airline services reflect increased block hours and improved profits from european and transatlantic operations 
in early  we restructured abx scheduled service for tnt airways sa as a conventional acmi agreement  which contributed positively to the segment earnings during also  in november  we added an additional transatlantic flight with dhl under a separate acmi agreement 
these improvements were partially offset by increased crew training costs  lower performance incentive revenues and higher aircraft maintenance expenses among the atsg airlines during maintenance expense not specifically reimbursed under contractual provisions increased by approximately million during compared to non reimbursed maintenance expenses increased due to premature engine and component failures as well as extra planned maintenance tasks with the intent of improving aircraft performance for future periods 
the costs of training flight crews increased in as the airlines added aircraft and made preparations to add additional aircraft in outlook ccia and ati have the exclusive right to supply all main deck freighter airlift in bax schenker us domestic network through december  the company and bax schenker have already begun discussions regarding the renewal or follow on agreements for services 
abx began to lease and operate a third and fourth dhl owned boeing aircraft beginning in the first quarter of each dhl owned aircraft will generate a pre negotiated monthly service fee 
acmi services results included revenues of million from bridging aircraft that abx temporarily supplied to dhl during these bridging revenues are expected to decline as dhl deploys the remaining two aircraft that it is committed to lease from cam 
through cam  we continue to make investments in boeing and aircraft 
as these aircraft are modified  we will place them into service under dry leasing arrangements to external customers or acmi operations using our airlines  depending on which alternative provides the best long term return and considering other factors  including geographical placement and customer diversification 
future earnings from acmi services will also be impacted by utilization levels which are driven by customer demand and our ability to maintain the aircraft at reliability levels expected by our customers 
customer preferences for acmi agreements with our airlines will depend on the cost competitiveness of the airlines 
new customer agreements typically involve start up expenses  including those for route authorities  overfly rights  travel and other activities  and may impact future operating results 
revenue generating service may begin sometime later  however  depending on satisfaction of a number of conditions  including international 
table of contents regulations and laws  contract negotiations  flight crew availability  and arranging resources for aircraft handling 
additional external aircraft leases by cam to other airlines may adversely impact the acmi services operating results by reducing utilization levels for our aircraft 
additionally  our earnings will fluctuate due to the timing of scheduled heavy maintenance which  under abx s policy are expensed as maintenance is performed

external customer revenues from all other activities increased million  to million in compared to the pre tax earnings from all other activities were million and million for and  respectively 
the increase in pre tax earnings of million for reflects million from the reduction to employee post retirement obligations  services fees for managing workers compensation claims for dhl  increased revenues from aircraft modification services and improved productivity at the usps sort centers we manage 
these increases to pre tax earnings for were partially offset by lower gains from sales of spare aircraft and engines in compared to outlook under the follow on agreements reached with dhl  our airborne maintenance and engineering services  inc ames subsidiary continues to provide maintenance services for the boeing aircraft that operate in the dhl network 
since the ames subsidiary was formed in from abx maintenance and engineering organization  it continues to add to its customer base and invest in new capabilities 
ames has limited hangar facilities and significant fixed costs 
as a result  our operating results in future quarters may be impacted by the amount and timing of the completion of aircraft maintenance and engineering projects for ames customers 
discontinued operations discontinued operations include the results of the hub services and the fuel management previously provided to dhl 
in july  sort operations in wilmington ceased and the sorting and hub operations were transferred to the cincinnati northern kentucky international airport cvg 
in conjunction with the transfer of the hub operations to cvg in july  dhl assumed management of fueling services for its us network previously provided by abx

the increase in maintenance expenses for also included additional c check expense for aircraft operated by abx  whose policy is to expense c checks as incurred 
additionally  aircraft maintenance expense increased due to procedures by ccia with the intent of improving the recent on time reliability level of the boeing and boeing aircraft 
the increase in maintenance expenses also reflects the increased cost to support the growth in block hours flown since and the higher maintenance cost for boeing aircraft operating in the bax schenker network 
ccia boeing aircraft scheduled in the bax schenker network have been assigned to operate on a greater number of multi stop routes compared to  which negatively impacted reliability and increased the costs of operating those aircraft 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million during  compared to depreciation expense increased due to the deployment of six modified aircraft since the end of landing and ramp expense  which includes the cost of deicing chemicals  decreased million in  compared to the decrease is a result of dhl removal of aircraft from service in conjunction with its us restructuring plan during the first quarter of travel expense increased million during compared to the increase is a result of additional crew training and increased international flying  particularly in the europe and asia pacific regions

as of december   cam had four boeing aircraft having a book value of million  which were in the process of being modified to standard freighter configuration and were temporarily removed from service 
acmi services had idle airframes with a carrying value of million whose engines and rotables were being used for other aircraft in the company fleets 
the spare airframes can be reactivated  as needed 
acmi services had one aircraft under an operating lease that was not scheduled for service through the end of its lease term in october acmi services revenues from acmi services declined million in compared to the results for acmi services in and were significantly impacted by dhl restructuring plans 
in  dhl began to restructure its us operations due to continued losses 
pursuant to its restructuring plans  dhl discontinued intra us domestic pickup and delivery services in january dhl now provides only international services to and from the us during  dhl discontinued the use of abx mcdonnell douglas dc aircraft and five of abx pratt whitney powered boeing aircraft 
pre tax earnings from the dhl acmi agreement were million for and decreased by million compared to due to the reductions in service in conjunction with dhl us restructuring 
revenues from the 
table of contents dhl acmi agreement reflected revenue amendments in and which effectively fixed abx pre tax earnings from the dhl acmi agreement for the fourth quarter of and each quarter of prior to the revenue amendments  expenses incurred under the dhl acmi agreement were generally marked up by and included in revenues 
the dhl acmi agreement also allowed abx to earn incremental revenues calculated on mark ups above the base mark up up to an additional under the dhl acmi agreement from the achievement of certain cost related and service goals specified in the two agreements 
under the revenue amendments  annual goals were not set for  nor were quarterly cost goals 
instead  the agreed revenue for included amounts to replace these incremental revenues 
in  abx and dhl executed the s r agreement to facilitate the restructuring and wind down of dhl us operations 
the s r agreement specified employee severance  retention and other benefits that dhl reimbursed to abx for payment to its employees that were affected by dhl us restructuring plan 
through december   abx terminated approximately  employee positions during the implementation by dhl of its us restructuring plan beginning in mid employees received severance  retention and other benefits under the s r agreement 
in accordance with the agreement  dhl was obligated to reimburse abx for the cost of non pilot employee severance  retention  productivity bonuses and vacation benefits paid

the company recorded a pension expense of million for the benefit amendments 
the company also agreed to fund the pilot pension plan with million in in addition to previously remitted contributions 
the company further agreed to pay million to furloughed crewmembers for severance benefits 
as a result  pre tax earnings for included million for settling the s r agreement funding with the crewmembers 
including the additional pension contribution of million made by the company  the settlement of the s r agreement funding resulted in a net cash outflow of approximately million after all payments were completed 
our pre tax earnings from the s r agreement for also included million for the reimbursement of employee vacation benefits that abx paid to terminated employees 
our pre tax earnings from continuing operations for included million from the s r agreement related to reimbursed employee vacation 
our results for acmi services include losses from a boeing transatlantic scheduled service which commenced in january we experienced higher costs for abx flight crews and lower cargo volumes than expected 
the costs of abx flight crews were detrimentally impacted due to scheduling changes caused when senior dc flight crewmembers were retrained for the boeing high levels of sick occurrences among crewmembers in resulted in higher pay premiums for unscheduled crewmembers who flew open routes 
in january  abx terminated the scheduled transatlantic service which generated the losses 
the operation was replaced by a conventional acmi agreement with tnt airways sa pre tax earnings in were also negatively impacted by the timing of scheduled aircraft maintenance checks 
abx  which expenses aircraft maintenance as it is incurred  completed eight scheduled maintenance checks during  compared to six maintenance checks during aircraft block hours flown for the acmi services segment declined to  hours in compared to  hours in  due to the removal of aircraft from the dhl acmi agreement starting in june in  the company recognized an impairment charge of million to reduce the combined ati and ccia goodwill to million 
projected cash flows for the airlines were expected to decline beginning in due to the deep economic recession 
the global economic recession affected us customers  including bax schenker 
ati and ccia each reduced their planned flying for bax schenker for ati planned to operate seven aircraft in the bax network in compared to nine dc aircraft in  and ccia planned to operate eight aircraft in  compared to twelve boeing aircraft for bax schenker us network in as of december   we tested the recorded goodwill associated with ati and ccia for impairment 
to test the goodwill  we determined the fair values of ati and ccia separately using industry market multiples and discounted cash flows  utilizing a market derived rate of return 
the impairment charge was precipitated by a large scale drop in market values of transportation companies and higher costs of capital emerging from the credit crisis in the fourth quarter of 
table of contents in conjunction with the goodwill test  we recorded a charge of million in to reduce ati and ccia customer relationship intangibles to their fair value at december  the carrying amount of the finite lived intangible assets was determined to not be recoverable because the carrying amount exceeded the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
the amount of the impairment charge was measured as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeded its fair value 
the fair value of these assets was derived using projected revenues from existing customers and related attrition rates 
the projected net cash flows attributed to existing customers were discounted using an estimated cost of capital based on market participant assumptions 
the impairment charge reflected lower projected revenues and earnings in future years from existing customers 
deep recessionary conditions in the us caused the demand for airlift from ati and ccia major customer  bax schenker  to decline 
additionally  ati experienced reductions in flying for the us military 
cam pre tax segment earnings for cam were million and million for and  respectively 
the increase in pre tax earnings reflects eight additional aircraft that cam has placed in service since december  cam results reflected an allocation of interest expense of million and million in and  respectively  based on prevailing interest rates and the carrying value of its operating assets 
cam revenues for and included million and million  respectively  for the leasing of aircraft to ati  ccia and abx 
other activities revenues from all other activities increased million during compared to increased revenues were primarily a result of an increase in aircraft and facility maintenance services when compared to pre tax earnings from all other activities were million during compared to million in lower pre tax earnings for compared to were a result of a net gain of million recorded in stemming from the insurance proceeds for an aircraft which experienced a fire prior to engine start and a charge of million in for professional fees stemming from the arbitration of a dispute with dhl

cash outlays included pension contributions of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
during  we contributed million to crewmember pension plans in conjunction with settling the s r agreement 
all of the cash generated from the discontinued operations was classified as operating cash flows because there were no assets or debts related to discontinued operations that generated investing or financing cash flows 
net operating cash generated from discontinued operations was million in  reflecting the reimbursement payments received from dhl for severance and employee benefits which we had paid to employees

table of contents outlook the table below summarizes the company s contractual obligations and commercial commitments in thousands as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years long term debt  including interest payments capital lease obligations operating leases unconditional purchase obligations employee severance and retention benefits total contractual cash obligations the long term debt bears interest at to per annum 
the company provides defined benefit pension plans to certain employee groups 
the table above does not include cash contributions for pension funding due to the absence of scheduled maturities 
the timing of pension and post retirement healthcare payments cannot be reasonably determined  except for million scheduled to be paid in we are considering additional pension contributions which would result in total contributions of million to million for we will periodically evaluate whether to make the additional contributions 
unconditional purchase obligations of million as of december  reflect the estimated remaining cost to complete the modification of the two boeing aircraft and one boeing aircraft that were undergoing freighter conversion at year end if cam were to cancel the conversion programs as of december   it would owe the vendor  iai  in addition to payments for aircraft currently undergoing modification  approximately million associated with additional conversion part kits which have been ordered 
we estimate that total capital expenditures for could total million to million and would include the completion of modifications for six boeing aircraft  three boeing aircraft and two or three boeing aircraft 
actual capital spending for any future period will be impacted by the number of aircraft we decide to modify and the progress in the aircraft modification process 
we expect to finance the aircraft purchases and modifications from current cash balances  future operating cash flow and existing credit facilities 
provisions of the company s credit agreement requires that cash proceeds from the sale of equipment and recoveries from insurance proceeds must be reinvested in like kind assets within days of receipt or remitted as a repayment against the term loan 
aggregate proceeds exceeding million in a calendar year must be remitted as a repayment against the term loan  except that the company is not required to remit proceeds from the put of aircraft to dhl toward the term loan 
at this time  we do not anticipate a required repayment of the term loan with proceeds from the sale of equipment or insurance recoveries 
through its credit agreement  the company has a syndicated  unsubordinated term loan and a revolving credit facility that are collateralized by substantially all the aircraft  property and equipment owned by the company that are not separately collateralized under aircraft loans or capital leases 
the lenders currently consist of us based financial institutions 
under the credit agreement  the company is subject to expenses  covenants and warranties that are usual and customary 
the credit agreement contains covenants including  among other things  limitations on certain additional indebtedness  guarantees of indebtedness  and the level of annual capital expenditures 
the credit agreement stipulates events of default including unspecified events that may have a material adverse effect on the company 
if an event of default occurs  the company may be forced to repay  renegotiate or replace the credit agreement 
as of december   the company had million of capitalized loan origination costs and million of unrealized losses from the hedging of interest payments that could adversely impact future operating results if the credit agreement is terminated early 
the company is in compliance with all financial covenants specified in the credit agreement 

table of contents the company existing credit agreement expires on december  at that time a balloon payment of million is due to the consortium of banks that finance the company term loan  plus any draws on the revolving credit facility that may be outstanding on december  we are exploring alternatives which may secure longer term debt financing before the balloon payment is due 
alternatives which we may consider include amending and extending the current credit agreement beyond  terminating and replacing the current credit agreement with a new bank facility  as well as other alternatives 
a new follow on credit agreement  assuming one can be obtained before december   may contain more restrictive covenants  dividend limitations  tighter restrictions on capital spending and higher costs of interest than the existing credit agreement 
liquidity at december   the company had approximately million of cash balances 
the company had million of unused credit facility  net of outstanding letters of credit of million  through a syndicated credit agreement that expires in december as specified under terms of abx cmi agreement with dhl  the million balance at december  of the unsecured note payable to dhl will be extinguished ratably without payment through march  we believe that the company current cash balances and forecasted cash flows provided from its operating agreements  combined with its credit facility  will be sufficient to fund operations  scheduled debt payments  required pension funding and planned capital expenditures for at least the next months 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spes  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of december  and  we were not involved in any material unconsolidated spe transactions 
certain of our operating leases and agreements contain indemnification obligations to the lessor or one or more other parties that are considered ordinary and customary eg use  tax and environmental indemnifications  the terms of which range in duration and are often limited 
such indemnification obligations may continue after the expiration of the respective lease or agreement 
no amounts have been recognized in our financial statements for the underlying fair value of guarantees and indemnifications 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as certain disclosures included elsewhere in this report  are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to select appropriate accounting policies and make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingencies 
in certain cases  there are alternative policies or estimation techniques which could be selected 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our selection of policies and the estimation techniques we use  including those related to revenue recognition  post retirement liabilities  bad debts  self insurance reserves  valuation of spare parts inventory  useful lives  salvage values and impairment of property and equipment  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current conditions and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources  as well as for identifying and assessing our accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following significant and critical accounting policies involve the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparing the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues generated from airline service agreements are typically recognized based on hours flown or the amount of aircraft and crew resources provided during a reporting period 
certain agreements include provisions for incentive payments based upon on time reliability 
these incentives are typically measured on a monthly basis and recorded to 
table of contents revenue in the corresponding month earned 
revenues for operating expenses that are reimbursed through customer agreements  including consumption of aircraft fuel  are generally recognized as the costs are incurred 
revenues from charter service agreements are recognized on scheduled and non scheduled flights when the specific flight has been completed 
revenue for the sale of aircraft parts are recognized when the parts are delivered 
revenues earned and expenses incurred in providing aircraft related maintenance  repair or technical services are recognized in the period in which the services are completed and delivered to the customer 
revenues derived from transporting freight and sorting parcels are recognized upon delivery of shipments and completion of services 
aircraft lease revenues are recognized as operating lease revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the applicable lease agreements 
the company revenues for and the first quarter of included reimbursement for expenses incurred under the former dhl acmi agreement  the incremental mark up revenues set by amendments to the dhl acmi agreement  and reimbursement for employee severance  retention  vacation and other benefit costs incurred during the period 
revenues from the former dhl acmi agreement were generally determined based on expenses incurred during a period plus mark ups and were recognized when the related services were performed 
abx and dhl amended the dhl acmi agreement to set mark ups to specific quarterly amounts for and the first quarter of in  abx and dhl executed a severance and retention agreement s r agreement which specified employee severance  retention and other benefits that dhl reimbursed to abx for payment to its employees that were affected in conjunction with dhl us restructuring plan 
dhl was obligated to reimburse abx for the cost of employee severance  retention  productivity bonuses and vacation benefits paid in accordance with the agreement 
goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with the financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification fasb asc topic intangibles goodwill and other  we assess in the fourth quarter of each year whether the company s goodwill acquired in acquisitions is impaired 
additional assessments may be performed on an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred 
indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized but are assessed for impairment annually  or more frequently if impairment indicators occur 
finite lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful economic lives and are periodically reviewed for impairment 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires significant judgment  including the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit that has goodwill 
the company has two reporting units  ati and cam  that have goodwill 
we estimate the fair value of ati and cam separately using a market approach and an income approach utilizing discounted cash flows applied to a market derived rate of return 
the market approach utilizes market multiples from comparable publicly traded companies 
the market multiples include revenues  ebit earnings before interest and taxes  ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and ebitdar earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization and rents 
we derive cash flow assumptions from many factors including recent market trends  expected revenues  cost structure  aircraft maintenance schedules and long term strategic plans for the deployment of aircraft 
key assumptions under the discounted cash flow models included projections for the number of aircraft in service  capital expenditures  long term growth rates  operating cash flows and market derived discount rates 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test requires a comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit to its respective carrying value 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit is less than its fair value  no indication of impairment exists and a second step is not performed 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit is higher than its fair value  there is an indication that an impairment may exist and a second step is performed 
in the second step  fair values are assigned to all of the assets and liabilities of a reporting unit  including any unrecognized intangible assets  and the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the recorded goodwill  an impairment loss is recorded for the difference and charged to operations 
we have used the assistance of an independent business valuation firm in estimating our expected market rate of return  and in the development of our market approach from comparable publicly traded companies 
based on our analysis  as of december   cam and ati s fair values each exceeded their carrying values by more than 
the company s key assumptions used for goodwill testing include uncertainties 
those uncertainties include the level of demand for cargo aircraft by shippers  the us military and freight forwarders and cam s ability to lease aircraft near their expected modification completion dates 
we anticipate  as of december   that cam will successfully modify eight more boeing aircraft into standard freighter configuration over the next year and deploy 
table of contents them under long term lease agreements 
we expect that ati will continue to operate for bax schenker and for the us military 
the demand for customer airlift is projected based on inputs from customers  the volume of bids requested by the us military  management s interface with customer planning personnel and aircraft utilization trends 
certain events or changes in circumstances could negatively impact our key assumptions 
customer preferences for cargo aircraft may be impacted by changes in aviation fuel prices 
dhl and other customers may decide that they do not need as many aircraft as projected  or they may find alternative airlift 
the company s finite lived intangible assets are for customer relationships acquired with ati 
these assets are amortized over their estimated useful economic lives and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
the fair value of this asset was derived using projected revenues from existing customers and related attrition rates using the guidance under fasb asc topic property  plant and equipment separately from a discounted cash flow model used for goodwill impairment 
the projected net cash flows attributed to existing customers were discounted using an estimated cost of capital  based on market participant assumptions 
depreciation depreciation of property and equipment is provided on a straight line basis over the lesser of the asset s useful life or lease term 
we periodically evaluate the estimated service lives and residual values used to depreciate our property and equipment 
the acceleration of depreciation expense or the recording of significant impairment losses could result from changes in the estimated useful lives of our assets 
we may change the estimated useful lives due to a number of reasons  such as the existence of excess capacity in our air system or ground networks  or changes in regulations grounding or limiting the use of aircraft 
self insurance we self insure certain claims relating to workers compensation  aircraft  automobile  general liability and employee healthcare 
we record a liability for reported claims and an estimate for incurred claims that have not yet been reported 
accruals for these claims are estimated utilizing historical paid claims data  recent claims trends and  in the case of employee healthcare and workers compensation  an independent actuarial evaluation 
changes in claim severity and frequency could result in actual claims being materially different than the costs provided for in our results of operations 
we maintain excess claim coverage with common insurance carriers to mitigate our exposure to large claim losses 
contingencies we are involved in legal matters that have a degree of uncertainty associated with them 
we continually assess the likely outcomes of these matters and the adequacy of amounts  if any  provided for these matters 
there can be no assurance that the ultimate outcome of these matters will not differ materially from our assessment of them 
there also can be no assurance that we know all matters that may be brought against us at any point in time 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the provisions of fasb asc topic income taxes 
the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
fluctuations in the actual outcome of expected future tax consequences could materially impact the company s financial position or its results of operations 
the company has significant deferred tax assets including net operating loss carryforwards nol cfs for federal income tax purposes which begin to expire in based upon projections of taxable income  we determined that it was more likely than not that the nol cf s will be realized prior to their expiration 
accordingly  we do not have an allowance against these deferred tax assets at this time 
we recognize the impact of a tax position  if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 

table of contents post retirement obligations the company sponsors qualified defined benefit pension plans for abx s flight crewmembers and other eligible employees 
the company also sponsors non qualified  unfunded excess plans that provide benefits to executive management and crewmembers that are in addition to amounts permitted to be paid through our qualified plans under provisions of the tax laws 
in  we amended each defined benefit plan to freeze the accrual of additional benefits and we provided notification to the affected employees 
the company also sponsors unfunded post retirement healthcare plans for abx s flight crewmembers and non flight crewmember employees 
the accounting and valuation for these post retirement obligations are determined by prescribed accounting and actuarial methods that consider a number of assumptions and estimates 
the selection of appropriate assumptions and estimates is significant due to the long time period over which benefits will be accrued and paid 
the long term nature of these benefit payouts increases the sensitivity of certain estimates on our post retirement costs 
in actuarially valuing our pension obligations and determining related expense amounts  assumptions we consider most sensitive are discount rates and expected long term investment returns on plan assets 
other assumptions concerning retirement ages  mortality and employee turnover also affect the valuations 
for our post retirement healthcare plans  consideration of future medical cost trend rates is an important assumption in valuing these obligations 
actual results and future changes in these assumptions could result in future costs that are materially different than those recorded in our annual results of operations 
our actuarial valuation includes an assumed long term rate of return on pension plan assets of 
our assumed rate of return is based on a targeted long term investment allocation of equity securities  fixed income securities and real estate 
the actual asset allocation at december  was equities  fixed income  real estate and cash 
the pension trust includes million of investments of the plans assets whose fair values have been estimated in the absence of readily determinable fair values 
such investments include private equity  multi fund investments and real estate funds 
management s estimates are based on information provided by the fund managers or general partners of those funds 
in evaluating our assumptions regarding expected long term investment returns on plan assets  we consider a number of factors  including our historical plan returns in connection with our asset allocation policies  assistance from investment consultants hired to provide oversight over our actively managed investment portfolio and long term inflation assumptions 
the selection of the expected return rate materially affects our pension costs 
we reduced our expected long term rate of return from to after analyzing expected returns on investment vehicles and considering our long term asset allocation expectations 
if we were to lower our long term rate of return assumption by a hypothetical basis points  expense in would be increased by approximately million 
we use a market value of assets as of the measurement date for determining pension expense 
in selecting the interest rate to discount estimated future benefit payments that have been earned to date to their net present value defined as the projected benefit obligation  we match the plan s benefit payment streams to high quality bonds of similar maturities 
the selection of the discount rate not only affects the reported funded status information as of december as shown in note j to the accompanying financial statements  but also affects the succeeding year s pension and post retirement healthcare costs 
the discount rates selected for december   based on the method described above  were to 
if we were to lower our discount rates by a hypothetical basis points  pension expense in would be increased by approximately million 
the assumed future increase in salaries and wages is no longer a significant estimate in determining pension costs because each defined benefit pension plan was frozen during with respect to additional benefit accruals 

table of contents the following table illustrates the sensitivity of the aforementioned assumptions on our pension expense in thousands effect of change december  change in assumption pension expense funded status accumulated other comprehensive income pre tax basis point decrease in rate of return basis point decrease in discount rate aggregate effect of all the above changes discontinued operations in accordance with the guidance of fasb asc topic presentation of financial statements  a business component whose operations are discontinued is reported as discontinued operations if the cash flows of the component have been eliminated from the ongoing operations of the company and the company will no longer have any significant continuing involvement in the business component 
the results of discontinued operations are aggregated and presented separately in the consolidated statement of operations 
fasb asc topic requires the reclassification of amounts presented for prior years to reflect their classification as discontinued operations 
exit activities we account for the costs associated with exit activities in accordance with fasb asc topic exit or disposal cost obligations 
one time  involuntary employee termination benefits are generally expensed when the company communicates the benefit arrangement to the employee that it will no longer require the services of the employee beyond a minimum retention period 
liabilities for contract termination costs associated with exit activities are recognized in the period incurred and measured initially at fair value 
pension obligations are accounted for in accordance with fasb asc topic compensation retirement benefits in the event that the expected working life of employees is significantly reduced due to terminations or a pension plan is suspended 
new accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued an accounting standards update no 
 receivables  disclosure about the credit quality of financing receivables and allowances for credit losses 
the new guidance will require additional disclosures about the nature of credit risk in a company portfolio of financing receivables  how risk is analyzed and assessed in arriving at the allowance for credit losses and the reasons for changes in the allowance for credit losses 
the new guidance will be effective in fiscal years beginning on or after december  and is not expected to have a material impact on the company financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company faces financial exposure to changes in interest rates 
as of december   we have million of fixed interest rate debt and million of variable interest rate debt outstanding 
variable interest rate debt exposes us to differences in future cash flows resulting from changes in market interest rates 
variable interest rate risk can be quantified by estimating the change in annual cash flows resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would have resulted in a change in interest expense of approximately million for the year ended december  the debt issued at fixed interest rates is exposed to fluctuations in fair value resulting from changes in market interest rates 
fixed interest rate risk can be quantified by estimating the increase in fair value of our long term debt through a hypothetical increase in interest rates 
as of december   a increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of our fixed interest rate debt by approximately million 

table of contents to reduce the effects of fluctuating libor based interest rates on interest payments that stem from its variable rate outstanding debt  the company entered into interest rate swaps in january under the interest rate swap agreements  the company will pay a fixed rate of and receive a floating rate that resets quarterly based on libor 
for the outstanding notional value  the company expects that the amounts received from the floating leg of the interest rate swap will offset fluctuating payments for interest expense because interest rates for its outstanding debt and the interest rate swap are both based on libor and reset quarterly 
the notional values were million as of december  see note l in the accompanying financial statements for discussion of our accounting treatment for these hedging transactions 
we are exposed to concentration of credit risk primarily through cash deposits  cash equivalents  marketable securities and derivatives 
as part of our risk management process  we monitor and evaluate the credit standing of the financial institutions with which we do business 
the financial institutions with which we do business are generally highly rated 
we are exposed to counterparty risk  which is the loss we could incur if a counterparty to a derivative contract defaulted 
at december   abx defined benefit pension plans had total investment assets of million under investment management 
see note j in the accompanying financial statements for further discussion of these assets 
in the ordinary course of our business  we are exposed to market risk for changes in the price of jet and diesel fuel  however  this risk is largely mitigated by reimbursement through abx cmi agreement with dhl  ati and ccia operating agreements with bax schenker and charter agreements with other customers
