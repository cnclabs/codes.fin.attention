item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive level overview during  we successfully completed two acquisitions totaling approximately million portec rail products  inc portec million 
interlocking deck systems international  llc idsi million 
the total amount of cash used to make these acquisitions  including amounts paid in  was approximately million  including approximately million of acquisition costs 
these expenditures were reduced by approximately million of cash acquired as well as a divestiture of a business acquired with portec which resulted in proceeds of approximately million 
while our acquisitions caused our cash and cash equivalents balances to decrease  the following items helped to maintain our financial position we generated million of cash from operating activities  which includes the previously mentioned acquisition costs 
we kept investments in our plants and facilities consistent with prior year levels 
we repaid million of total debt  including the pay off of our term loan 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and a revolving credit facility with approximately million of availability while carrying only million in total debt 
developments acquisitions portec rail products  inc on december   we closed our cash offer  originally announced on february  and amended on august   for all the issued and outstanding shares of portec common stock at a purchase price of per share  or approximately million  including amounts paid in january on december   we completed the merger of portec into a wholly owned subsidiary 
the acquisition of portec will help us become a strategic provider of products and services below the wheel for the class i  transit  shortline and regional railroad and contractors in north america  as well as to railways  governmental agencies  passenger car manufacturers and rail contractors globally 
it will broaden our offerings by adding portec s friction management and wayside detection products and services 
this acquisition will also assist our international expansion of existing products as portec currently has a strong presence in canada and the united kingdom through wholly owned subsidiaries  and has continued to improve its presence in europe  brazil  southeast asia  china and australia 
portec will be reported through our rail products segment 
since the acquisition date  portec contributed million in net sales  million in gross profit and a net loss of million for the period ended december  we do not believe the results generated from the two week period from the acquisition date through december  are indicative of portec s quarterly or annual results of operations 
interlocking deck systems international llc on march   we purchased certain assets from idsi 
the purchase price was million and it was allocated to certain equipment  raw material inventory  other assets  proprietary software  intangibles  and goodwill related to idsi steel bridge decking business 
we paid million in cash on the closing date and issued a note for the remaining purchase price  which is payable on the first and second anniversary of the closing in amounts of million on each anniversary 
no liabilities were assumed in this acquisition 

table of contents recent developments in december  the uprr opted not to extend the supply agreement and lease renewal for the grand island  ne plant 
production for the remaining orders was completed during the first quarter of we believe the dismantling of the facility according to the terms of the supply agreement and the winding down of operations will be completed in the third quarter of sales to the uprr from this facility approximated million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we do not believe that the closure of this facility will have a significant  adverse impact on our results of operations or our liquidity

critical accounting policies and estimates the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
when more than one accounting principle  or the method of its application  is generally accepted  management selects the principle or method that is appropriate in the company s specific circumstance 
application of these accounting principles requires management to make estimates that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the following critical accounting policies relate to the company s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 

table of contents goodwill goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually 
the company performs its annual impairment test as of october st and more frequently when indicators of impairment are present 
the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  a second step is required to measure the goodwill impairment loss 
this step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment loss equal to the excess is recorded as a component of continuing operations 
the company uses a combination of market approach and a discounted cash flow model dcf model to determine the current fair value of the business 
a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the dcf model to forecast operating cash flows  including markets and market share  sales volume and pricing  costs to produce and working capital changes 
the company considers historical experience and available information at the time the fair values of its business are estimated 
however  actual amounts realized may differ from those used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values  the company may be exposed to impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations 
there were no goodwill impairments recorded during the three years ended december  asset impairment the company is required to test for asset impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset might not be recoverable 
the company applies the guidance in fasb asc  and related guidance  in order to determine whether or not an asset is impaired 
this guidance indicates that if the sum of the future expected cash flows associated with an asset  undiscounted and without interest charges  is less than the carrying value  an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements 
the amount of the impairment is the difference between the fair value of the asset and the carrying value of the asset 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to asset impairment is a critical accounting estimate as it is highly susceptible to change from period to period and because it requires management to make assumptions about the existence of impairment indicators and cash flows over future years 
these assumptions impact the amount of an impairment  which would have an impact on the income statement 
there were no asset impairments recorded during the three years ended december  allowance for bad debts the company s operating segments encounter risks associated with the collection of accounts receivable 
as such  the company records a monthly provision for accounts receivable that are deemed uncollectible 
in order to calculate the appropriate monthly provision  the company reviews its accounts receivable aging and calculates an allowance through application of historic reserve factors to overdue receivables 
this calculation is supplemented by specific account reviews performed by the company s credit department 
as necessary  the application of the company s allowance rates to specific customers is reviewed and adjusted to more accurately reflect the credit risk inherent within that customer relationship 
the reserve is reviewed on a monthly basis 
an account receivable is written off against the allowance when management determines it is uncollectible 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to the allowance for bad debts is a critical accounting estimate because the underlying assumptions used for the allowance can change from period to period and the allowance could potentially cause a material impact to the income statement 
specific customer circumstances and general economic conditions may vary significantly from management s assumptions and may impact expected earnings 
at december  and  the company maintained an allowance for bad debts of million and million  respectively 
product liability the company maintains a current liability for the repair or replacement of defective products 
for certain manufactured products  an accrual is made on a monthly basis as a percentage of cost of sales 
for long term construction projects  a liability is established when the claim is known and quantifiable 
the product liability accrual is periodically adjusted based on the identification or resolution of known individual product liability claims 
the company believes that this is a critical accounting estimate because the underlying assumptions used to calculate the liability can change from period to period 
at december  and  the product liability was million and million  respectively 
for additional information regarding the company s product liability  refer to part ii  item  footnote commitments and contingent liabilities 

table of contents slow moving inventory slow moving inventory is reviewed and adjusted routinely  taking into account numerous factors such as quantities on hand versus turnover  product knowledge  and physical inventory observations 
this review is performed on a specific product basis and effectively establishes a new cost for the underlying product 
the company believes this is a critical accounting estimate because the underlying assumptions can change from period to period and could have a material impact on the income statement 
revenue recognition the company s revenues are composed of product sales and products and services provided under long term contracts 
for product sales  the company recognizes revenue upon transfer of title to the customer 
title generally passes to the customer upon shipment 
in limited cases  title does not transfer and revenue is not recognized until the customer has received the products at its physical location 
shipping and handling costs are included in cost of goods sold 
revenues for products under long term contracts are generally recognized using the percentage of completion method based upon the proportion of actual costs incurred to estimated total costs 
for certain products  the percentage of completion is based upon actual labor costs to estimated total labor costs 
revenues recognized using percentage of completion were less than of the company s consolidated revenues for the year ended december  with the addition of portec  the contribution of revenues recognized using percentage of completion is expected to continue to decline in future periods 
pension plans the calculation of the company s net periodic benefit cost pension expense and benefit obligation pension liability associated with its defined benefit pension plans pension plans requires the use of a number of assumptions that the company deems to be critical accounting estimates 
changes in these assumptions can result in a different pension expense and liability amounts  and future actual experience can differ significantly from the assumptions 
the company believes that the two most critical assumptions are the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate 
the expected long term rate of return reflects the average rate of earnings expected on funds invested or to be invested in the pension plans to provide for the benefits included in the pension liability 
the company establishes the expected long term rate of return at the beginning of each fiscal year based upon information available to the company at that time  including the plan s investment mix and the forecasted rates of return on these types of securities 
any differences between actual experience and assumed experience are deferred as an unrecognized actuarial gain or loss 
the unrecognized actuarial gains or losses are amortized in accordance with applicable guidance  generally fasb asc  compensation nonretirement postemployment benefits 
the expected long term rate of return determined by the company for and pension expense was in each year 
pension expense increases as the expected long term rate of return decreases 
the assumed discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension benefits could effectively be settled 
in estimating that rate  applicable guidance requires that the company looks to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments 
the company s pension liability increases as the discount rate is reduced 
therefore  the decline in the assumed discount rate has the effect of increasing the company s pension obligation and future pension expense 
the weighted average assumed discount rate used by the company was and  respectively  as of december  and deferred tax assets the recognition of deferred tax assets requires management to make judgments regarding the future realization of these assets 
as prescribed by fasb asc  income taxes  valuation allowances must be provided for those deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not a likelihood more than that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
this guidance requires management to evaluate positive and negative evidence regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets 
determination of whether the positive evidence outweighs the negative and quantification of the valuation allowance requires management to make estimates and judgments of future financial results 
the company believes that these estimates and judgments are critical accounting estimates 

table of contents the company evaluates all tax positions taken on the state and federal tax filings to determine if the position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination 
for positions that meet the more likely than not to be sustained criteria  an evaluation to determine the largest amount of benefit  determined on a cumulative probability basis that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement  is determined 
a previously recognized tax position is derecognized when it is subsequently determined that a tax position no longer meets the more likely than not threshold to be sustained 
the evaluation of the sustainability of a tax position and the probable amount that is more likely than not is based on judgment  historical experience and on various other assumptions 
the results of these estimates  that are not readily apparent from other sources  form the basis for recognizing an uncertain tax position liability 
actual results could differ from those estimates upon subsequent resolution of identified matters 
refer to part ii  item  footnote  income taxes 
the company s ability to realize these tax benefits may affect the company s reported income tax expense and net income 
contingencies the company is currently involved in certain legal proceedings 
when a probable  estimable exposure exists  the company accrues the estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these matters 
these estimates have been developed in consultation with legal counsel involved in the defense of these matters and are based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
future results of operations could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the outcome of these proceedings 
the company s operations are subject to national  state  foreign  provincial  and or local laws and regulations that impose limitations and prohibitions on the discharge and emission of  and establish standards for the use  disposal  and management of  regulated materials and waste  and that impose liability for the costs of investigating and cleaning up  and damages resulting from  present and past spills  disposals  or other releases of hazardous substances or materials 
liabilities are recorded when remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
estimates are not reduced by potential claims for recovery 
claims for recovery are recognized as agreements are reached with third parties or as amounts are received 
established reserves are periodically reviewed and adjusted to reflect current remediation progress  prospective estimates of required activity  and other factors that may be relevant  including changes in technology or regulations 
as of december  and  the company maintained environmental and legal contingency reserves approximating million and million  respectively

new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued changes to the consolidation guidance applicable to a variable interest entity vie 
fasb asc topic  consolidation  amends the guidance governing the determination of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a vie  and is  therefore  required to consolidate an entity  by requiring a qualitative analysis rather than a quantitative analysis 
the qualitative analysis will include  among other things  consideration of who has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and who has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie 
this standard also requires continuous reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a vie 
previously  fin r required reconsideration of whether an enterprise was the primary beneficiary of a vie only when specific events had occurred 
fasb asc also requires enhanced disclosures about an enterprise s involvement with a vie 
the company adopted the changes issued by the fasb to accounting for vie s on january  
table of contents in january  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
this update provides amendments to fasb asc  fair value measurements  that requires entities to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements and describe the reasons for the transfers 
in addition  the update requires entities to present separately information about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs level 
the disclosures related to level and level fair value measurements are effective for the company beginning in and the disclosures related to level fair value measurements are effective for the company in the update requires only new disclosures and had no impact on the company s financial statements

our fabricated products division sales improvement came predominately from stronger bridge decking sales 
while our fabricated products division was able to leverage increased volumes into expanded gross profit margins  overall our construction products gross profit margins were comparatively flat with the period 
our piling division s sales growth in the current quarter came at the expense of lower pricing due to commodity price declines as well as an extremely competitive environment  while our concrete buildings division s gross profit margins where hampered by increased plant expenses and lower margin products typically purchased by the federal agencies that drove the sales increase previously noted

the improvement in gross profit is due  in part  to negative adjustments of approximately million taken in the period related to concrete tie issues as well as a significant current period improvement in manufacturing variances 
gross profit also increased over the prior year due to a favorable million resolution of a supply chain dispute 
we account for a portion of our inventory under the lifo method 
the lifo reserve requirements can be positively or negatively impacted by falling or rising prices 
the credit to gross profit resulting from this lifo adjustment was million lower in than in  as there was greater price volatility in the prior year 
the foremost causes of the increased selling and administrative costs for the year to date period were million for acquisition costs  million for compensation expenses and million for bad debt expense  due to a recovery recorded in for  we recorded a million loss from our jv equity method investment 
our effective income tax rate for the period  decreased compared to the period   due to increased domestic manufacturing credits partially offset by certain acquisition costs that were not deductible for tax purposes 
the year compared to the year company analysis net income for the year ended december  was per diluted share which compares to net income of per diluted share for the year ended december  included in net income is the pre tax gain associated with the sale of marketable securities million 
included in net income for the prior year were pre tax gains from the receipt of escrow proceeds related to the sale of our investment in the dm e railroad million and the sale leaseback of our houston  tx facility million 
due to the general declining price environment and reduced volumes caused by the recession in  our gross profit was negatively impacted by market related inventory adjustments and increased unfavorable manufacturing variances 
these negative impacts were entirely mitigated by reduced lifo reserve requirements for the full year  while the prior year period included increased reserve requirements  and led to flat gross profit margins year over year 
the primary reasons for reduced selling and administrative costs were reduced incentive compensation  travel and entertainment expenses and bad debt expense 
interest expense decreased from the prior year period due primarily to reduced borrowings and secondarily lower interest rates 
sharply reduced interest rates resulted in lower interest income earned on our various cash and cash equivalent instruments 
we sold a portion of our investment in marketable securities and realized a pre tax gain of million 
income taxes in were recorded at approximately  as compared to the prior year period rate of  due to a lower manufacturing credit  state return to provision adjustments and reduced tax exempt interest income

both our arp and transit divisions benefitted from improved volumes over the prior year period 
finally  our new portec subsidiary contributed million in additional net sales since the acquisition date 
improvements in our rail products gross profit were due primarily to the prior year charges of million related to concrete tie issues which occurred in gross profit also increased over the prior year due to a favorable million resolution of a supply chain dispute 
additionally  improvements in selling margins including improved material variances  as well as improved manufacturing variances  had a positive impact on reported results 
lastly  while portec increased our rail products segment gross profit by approximately million  it had no impact on our gross profit margin 
portec s gross profit included an increase to cost of goods sold of million related to recognition of a portion of the inventory step up to fair value from portec s purchase price allocation 
excluding the million in concrete tie gross profit charges  our rail products segment gross profit would have increased approximately basis points compared to the period

a continued soft industrial market 
challenges from reduced sales related to the loss of the uprr contract at our grand island  ne tie facility 
sales and gross profit growth resulting from the portec acquisition 
the year compared to the year reduced market demand within our rail distribution business drove the overall decrease in rail products sales for the year ended december  as compared to depressed market conditions reduced sales in our transit products division compared to its record sales year in market conditions and low uprr purchasing levels led to overall lower demand and sales of our cxt concrete ties throughout also  our grand island  ne facility was negatively impacted by below specification raw materials that led the uprr to reject certain concrete ties 

table of contents gross profit margin declined across most of our divisions within our rail products segment 
two causes of our reduced gross profit related to the following two specific issues at our concrete tie division 
the first is the cumulative impact during of approximately million in warranty charges related to in track failures of our prestressed concrete railroad ties 
the second is the million of gross profit charges associated with the rejection by the uprr of concrete railroad ties which contained below specification raw materials 
the remainder of the divisions experienced margin contraction during associated  generally  with demand and pricing declines with the exception of our arp division 
the demand declines resulted in decreased production volumes and caused increased unabsorbed plant expenses and increased charges for slow moving and obsolete inventory 
notable unfavorable slow moving and obsolete inventory charges were million recorded by our rail distribution business and million by our concrete tie businesses

while sales have improved somewhat in from their levels  the backlog within this division is up approximately over our construction products gross profit margin improved in all divisions with the exception of piling 
our piling division has experienced margin compression due to an intensely competitive bidding environment and a weak industrial market 
we continue to see a mixed outlook in our heavy civil and public works construction markets as we experience increased volumes that have been partially offset by declines in pricing 
also  we do not believe that our construction products segment will have the opportunities generated from the stimulus bill in as it did in a number of other factors are likely to impact our construction products segment sales and gross profit 
negative factors impacting these results include approximately states currently facing  or are projecting to have  fiscal year budget deficits 
federal legislation  safetea lu  authorizing transportation construction funding which expired in september and has been temporarily extended through september  the heavy civil and public works construction market that we participate in remains moderate nationwide leading to increased competition 

table of contents the year compared to the year improved sales performance from both our fabricated products and concrete buildings divisions was entirely offset by significant sales declines by our piling division 
reduced demand caused by the nationwide softening in our heavy civil and public works construction markets led to reductions in sales volumes and pricing across most of our piling product offerings 
strong bridge activity drove the sales increases within our fabricated products division while increased new orders and sales provided growth within our concrete buildings division 
the impact of volume declines within our piling division and a declining price environment also contributed to the reduction of our construction products gross profit margin

while the energy markets we participate in are getting stronger  they will be challenged by lower natural gas prices throughout as a result  our tubular products segment heads into with a significantly reduced backlog compared to when it entered the year compared to the year significant weakness in the energy markets served by our tubular products segment resulted in reductions in sales volumes as well as profitability 
reductions in pipe pricing and unfavorable manufacturing variances have had significant  adverse affects to the gross profit margins in our threaded products division 
although our threaded products facility reported a temporary increase in volumes from our strategy involved with exiting the micropile market  due to falling prices and reduced demand  we recorded a lower of cost or market adjustment of approximately million

outlook our businesses and results of operations have been impacted by the downturn in the global economy 
we believe that the recession  continued credit concerns and expected reductions in federal and state government spending will present challenges to many of the end markets to which we sell

however  we also expect to be profitable and to generate positive cash flow 
we believe that when conditions do improve the markets we participate in will be poised to benefit
