manufacturing idaho timber business description idaho timber  which was acquired in may  is headquartered in boise  idaho and is engaged in the manufacture and or distribution of various wood products 
idaho timber s principal product lines include remanufacturing dimension lumber  remanufacturing  bundling and bar coding of home center boards for large retailers  and production of radius edge  pine decking 
idaho timber also manufactures and or distributes a number of other specialty wood products 
idaho timber has over years of operating experience in its industry 
the net book value of the company s investment in idaho timber was  at december  remanufactured dimension lumber is idaho timber s largest product line 
dimension lumber is used for general construction and home improvement  remodeling and repair projects  the demand for which is normally a function of housing starts and home size 
all dimension lumber is assigned a quality grade  based on the imperfections in the wood  and higher grade lumber is sold at a higher price than lower grade lumber 
idaho timber purchases low grade dimension lumber from sawmills located in north america and europe and upgrades it into higher grade dimension lumber products 
the remanufacturing process includes ripping  trimming and planing lumber to reduce imperfections and produce a variety of lumber sizes 
these products are produced at plants located in florida  north carol ina  texas  idaho and new mexico 
each plant distributes its product primarily by truck to lumber yards and contractors within a mile shipping radius from the plant site 
home center board products are principally sold to large home improvement retailers 
idaho timber purchases high grade boards from sawmills in the western us  south america and new zealand primarily pine but other wood species are also used  performs minor re work on those boards to upgrade the quality  and then packages and bar codes those boards according to customer specifications 
production takes place in an owned plant in idaho 
idaho timber also operates a sawmill in arkansas to produce its radius edge  pine decking products 
idaho timber performs traditional sawmill processes cutting  drying and planing to manufacture these products 
idaho timber owns and operates seven plants  one sawmill that principally produces decking products and one sawmill that produces split rail fencing 
these nine facilities in the aggregate have approximately  square feet of manufacturing and office space  covering approximately acres 
one plant is principally dedicated to home center board products and the remaining plants principally produce remanufactured dimension lumber products 
all plant locations can produce and distribute specialty wood products 
idaho timber has the capacity to ship approximately million board feet per month on a one shift basis  during actual shipments averaged approximately million board feet per month 
sales and marketing idaho timber primarily markets to local  regional and national lumber retailers for its dimension lumber products  home improvement centers for its home center board products and decking treaters for its sawmill product  and other resellers of home construction materials 
its success in attracting and retaining customers depends in large part on its ability to provide quicker delivery of specified customer products than its competitors 
for dimension lumber products  sales are primarily generated at each of the plants  with a dedicated sales force located in the same geographic region as the customers the plant serves 
board and decking products are sold and managed centrally 
sales of home center board products are heavily dependent on national home center chains which accounted for appro ximately of product revenues and of idaho timber s total revenue for the year ended december  the customer base for the dimension lumber business is much less concentrated  no customer accounts for more than of revenue 
idaho timber s sales are somewhat concentrated in regions where its facilities are located  with the largest being florida   north carolina   and texas  
competition idaho timber sells commodity products  and operates in an industry that is very competitive and currently suffering from continuing lack of demand due to limited housing starts and remodeling activity 
idaho timber competes against domestic and foreign sawmills and intermediate distributors for its dimension lumber and decking products 
in some cases  idaho timber competes on a limited basis with the same sawmills that are a source of supply of low grade dimension lumber 
the home center board business has many competitors  and suppliers to large home centers are always under pressure to reduce prices 
idaho timber also competes for raw material purchases needed for its remanufactured dimension lumber and home center board products 
a recent increase in off shore demand for low grade lumber used in its remanufacturing facilities has further constrained available supply 
also  in the past the availability and pricing of certain raw materials has been adversely affected by export charges tariffs imposed on canadian exports  the largest source of these supplies 
a decades old trade dispute between the us and canada resurfaced with the expiration of the softwood lumber agreement in in october  the trade dispute was resolved and a new softwood lumber agreement between canada and the us became effective 
the agreement has a seven year term and may be extended for an additional t wo years 
currently  restrictions on canadian exports are not significantly adversely affecting idaho timber s operations  however  if tariffs continue beyond the current term of the softwood lumber agreement or further import limitations are imposed in the future  it is possible that raw material costs could increase or supplies could be constrained 
during most of  the export charge was at the maximum level 
idaho timber is examining alternative sources of supply to increase its raw material purchasing flexibility 
government regulation lumber and decking are identified at idaho timber facilities with a grade stamp that shows the grade  moisture content  mill number  species and grading agency 
all lumber is graded in compliance with the national grading rule for dimension lumber  which is published by the us department of commerce 
idaho timber facilities are subject to regular inspection by agencies approved by the american lumber standards committee 
idaho timber believes that its procedure for grading lumber is highly accurate  however  idaho timber could be exposed to product liability claims if it can be demonstrated its products are inappropriately rated 
since idaho timber s sawmills do not treat its wood with chemicals  and since timber deeds purchased from private land owners do not impose a re planting obligation  idaho timber does not have any unusual environmental compliance issues 
plastics manufacturing business description through conwed plastics  which was acquired in march  the company manufactures and markets lightweight plastic netting used for a variety of purposes including  among other things  building and construction  erosion control  packaging  agricultural  carpet padding  filtration and consumer products 
these products are primarily used for containment purposes  reinforcement of other products  packaging for produce and meats  various types of filtration and erosion prevention 
conwed plastics believes it is a market leader in netting products used in carpet cushion  turf reinforcement  erosion control and packaging 
agricultural  erosion control and building and construction markets tend to be seasonal  with peak periods in the second and third quarters of the calendar year 
packaging is se asonal with the second quarter being the slowest period in this market 
carpet padding  filtration and consumer product markets are not usually subject to seasonal fluctuations resulting in sales that tend to be evenly spread throughout the year 
the net book value of the company s investment in conwed plastics was  at december certain products of conwed plastics are proprietary  protected by patents and or trade secrets 
the company holds patents on certain improvements to the basic manufacturing processes it uses and on applications thereof 
the company believes that the expiration of these patents  individually or in the aggregate  is unlikely to have a material effect on its operations 
sales and marketing products are marketed both domestically and internationally  with approximately of revenues generated by customers from europe  latin america  japan and australia 
products are sold primarily through an employee sales force  located in the us and europe 
conwed plastics emphasizes development of new products and new applications of existing products to grow its revenues 
new product development focuses on market niches where proprietary technology and expertise can lead to sustainable competitive economic advantages 
conwed plastics has completed eight acquisitions since and continues to look for additional acquisition opportunities 
these acquisitions have provided synergies with existing customers  manufacturing capacity  an expanded customer base and or product lines 
approximately half of conwed plastics revenues are generated on a make to order basis 
the remainder of conwed plastics sales requires a more substantial investment in inventory that is stored at various locations to service customers with short lead time requirements 
in the aggregate  inventory is turned over between and times per year 
the top customers typically represent approximately to of total sales 
the largest single customer typically represents to of total sales  for the year ended december   the largest single customer represented approximately of total sales 
order backlog generally ranges from to of annual sales throughout the year 
competition conwed plastics is subject to domestic and international competition  generally on the basis of price  service and quality 
conwed plastics has to competitors in most of its market segments but the size and type of its competition varies by market segment 
additionally  certain products are dependent on cyclical industries  including the construction industry 
the cost of the principal raw material used in its products  polypropylene  has increased by approximately from the price of polypropylene has historically fluctuated with the price of oil and natural gas but growing economies in china and india have resulted in increased demand for raw materials and raised prices globally 
conwed plastics has been able to raise prices to its customers during this period to of fset some of the increase in raw material costs  however  increasing competitive pressures have reduced conwed s ability to further raise prices to offset rising raw material costs 
oil and gas drilling services acquisition the company initially acquired a limited liability company interest in and provided secured financing to keen in  thereafter  the company increased its equity interest and loans at various times during and in november  the company purchased keen s remaining equity interests plus a secured note payable to the other equity owner of keen for aggregate cash consideration of  at december   the company owns all of keen s equity interests and the net book value of its investment in keen s debt and equity securities aggregated  business description keen is a land based contract oil and gas drilling company based in stillwater  oklahoma that provides drilling services to independent oil and natural gas exploration and production companies in the mid continent region of the us keen currently operates drilling rigs in oklahoma  texas  arkansas  louisiana and kansas 
keen  which has been in business since  typically generates revenues through drilling contracts based on daily rates daywork contracts  footage charged by depth of the well or based on a turnkey contract fixed price to drill a well 
keen supplies the drilling rig  all ancillary equipment and drilling personnel 
the majority of wells drilled by keen are in unconventional basins that are characterized by complex geological formations often requiring higher horsepowe r  premium rigs and or experienced crews to reach targeted depths 
in  the majority of drilling services were performed pursuant to daywork contracts 
each of keen s drilling rigs consists of engines  drawworks  a mast  pumps  blowout preventers  a drill string and ancillary equipment 
keen s drilling rigs can operate hours a day  seven days a week and are generally staffed with crews of four to six persons 
once keen has drilled a well for a customer  the drilling rig will be moved off of the well and another service provider will use a service rig a smaller rig that is built for completions  which brings the well into production 
keen does not provide completion services 
the intended well depth and the geological formation of the drilling site are the principal factors that determine the size and type of rig most suitable for a particular drilling job 
all of keen s rigs are capable of drilling ho rizontal and directional wells 
at december   keen has drilling rigs in its fleet that have rated maximum depth capabilities ranging from  feet to  feet 
keen s employees perform periodic maintenance and routine repair work on the drilling rigs  the bulk of major repair and overhaul work is done by various oilfield service companies 
keen also owns and operates a fleet of trucks  trailers and other construction equipment used to transport its rigs and to construct or take down its rigs at drilling locations 
by owning its own equipment  keen believes it is able to better manage the cost of moving its rigs  reduce the downtime between moves and minimize the general wear and tear on drilling rigs 
keen s customers are not required to use keen s equipment or trucks to move keen s drilling rigs 
keen s revenue volume and profitability are significantly affected by the actual and anticipated price of natural gas and oil  levels of natural gas and oil in storage and the supply of drilling rigs available in the marketplace 
the exploration and production industry is cyclical and the level of exploration and production activity has historically been very volatile 
during periods of lower levels of drilling activity  price competition for drilling services tends to increase  which may result in reduced revenues and profitability  conversely  during periods of increased drilling activity  drilling rigs are in demand often resulting in higher prices and contractual commitments from customers to obtain exclusive use of a particular rig for a longer term 
while keen s revenues and profitabi lity during were adversely impacted by continued low natural gas prices and high levels of natural gas inventory  this was partially offset by increased drilling activity for oil 
seasonality does not significantly impact keen s business or operations 
additionally  the drilling activity of oil and natural gas exploration and production companies is strongly affected by their ability to access the capital markets  which was curtailed during late and many of keen s customers reduced their spending plans for exploration  production and development activities resulting in decreased demand for keen s rigs 
keen s customers access to the capital markets improved during  though available liquidity is not as great as it was before decreases in drilling activity and spending for a sustained period of time is likely to result in a reduction in keen s daily rates  utilization rates and profitability 
sales and marketing keen markets its drilling rigs to a number of independent oil and gas companies 
most of keen s contracts are with established customers on a competitive bid or negotiated basis and may cover one well  a multi well project or are entered into for a specified period of time 
at december   keen has drilling rigs under contract for a remaining term of more than year  rigs are operating under term contracts that will expire within the next months  are under well to well contracts with specific customers  and are not currently under contract 
in january  keen sold its older mechanical rigs  only three of these rigs were operating under contract at the end of the year 
during  these rigs generated revenues of  keen s business is fairly concentrated with its top eight customers accounting for over of drilling revenues 
two customers accounted for of drilling revenues and six other customers each exceeded of drilling revenues 
in  keen s revenues are only reflected in the consolidated financial statements from when it became a consolidated subsidiary in november competition customers award contracts to contract drillers based on factors such as price  rig availability  quality of service  proximity to the well site  experience with the specific geological formation  condition and type of equipment  reputation  safety of operations and customer relationships 
contracts for drilling services may be awarded based solely on price 
there is currently an oversupply of drilling rigs in the market  and at such times price is the primary determinant by which customers award contracts 
although contract drilling companies generally compete on a regional basis  drilling rigs can be moved from one market to another in response to market conditions which can have the effect of increasing competition

the hard rock biloxi s new casino was constructed over water on concrete pilings that greatly improved the structural integrity of the facility  however  the threat of hurricanes remains a risk to the repaired and rebuilt facilities 
premier s current insurance policy provides up to  in coverage for damage to real and personal property including business interruption coverage 
the coverage is provided by a panel of insurers based out of the us  bermuda  and london and is comprised of a  primary layer and three excess layers 
the coverage is syndicated through several insurance carriers  each with an am best rating of a excellent or better 
although the insurance policy is an all risk policy  any loss resulting from a weather catastrophe occurrence  which is defined to include damage caused by a named storm  is sublimited to  with a deductible of  chapter litigation in connection with premier s chapter restructuring  the former holders of premier s bond debt argued that they were entitled to liquidated damages under the indenture governing the notes  and as such were entitled to more than the principal amount of the notes plus accrued interest that was paid to them when premier emerged from bankruptcy in although the company did not agree with the position taken by the premier noteholders  in order to have premier s bankruptcy plan confirmed so that premier could complete reconstruction of its property after hurricane katrina and open its business without further delay  premier funded an escrow account to cover the premier noteholders claim for additional damages in the amount of  on september   the bankruptcy court for the southern district of mississippi awarded the premier noteholders  plus interest at the federal judgment rate in effect on august  from that date until the date of payment  but in no event would the premier noteholders be entitled to damages in an amount exceeding the amount held in the escrow account 
any funds remaining in the escrow account after payment of the award are to be returned to premier

as a result of the bankruptcy court s decision  the company recorded a loss in selling  general and other expenses in for the award and interest of  competition premier faces significant competition primarily from ten other gaming operations in the mississippi gulf coast gaming market and secondarily from gaming operations in baton rouge and new orleans  louisiana as well as from a native american casino in atmore  alabama 
other competition comes from gaming operations in lake charles  bossier city and shreveport  louisiana  tunica and philadelphia  mississippi  tampa and hollywood  florida and other states 
such competition may increase if gaming operations grow in these markets or if legalized gaming expands to nearby states 
many of premier s competitors are larger and have greater marketing and financial resources 
government regulation the gaming industry in mississippi is highly regulated 
premier  its ownership and management are subject to findings of suitability reviews by the mississippi gaming commission 
in addition  the laws  rules and regulations of state and local governments in mississippi require premier to hold various licenses  registrations and permits and to obtain various approvals for a variety of matters 
in order to continue operating  premier must remain in compliance with all laws  rules and regulations and pay gaming taxes on its gross gaming revenues 
failure to maintain such approvals or obtain renewals when due  or failure to comply with new laws or regulations or changes to existing laws and regulations would have an adverse effect on premier s business 
premier believes it is in compliance with all governmenta l rules and regulations

the land and the residential units are not collateral for mb s indebtedness 
during the second quarter of  mb was unable to make scheduled payments under its interest rate swap agreement and received several default notices under its bank loan 
these events constituted a change in circumstances that caused the company to conclude that the carrying amount of mb s real estate asset was not recoverable  accordingly  the company recorded an impairment charge of  classified as selling  general and other expenses  which reduced the carrying amount of mb s real estate to its fair value

residential property sales volume  prices and new building starts have declined significantly in many us markets  including markets in which the company has real estate projects in various stages of development 
the slowdown in residential sales has been exacerbated by the turmoil in the mortgage lending and credit markets  which has resulted in stricter lending standards and reduced liquidity for prospective home buyers

medical product development business at december   the company owned approximately of sangart  a biopharmaceutical company principally engaged in developing medicines designed to enhance the oxygenation of oxygen deprived tissues through targeted oxygen delivery 
from through december   the company invested an aggregate of  in sangart  principally to help fund sangart s ongoing product development activities as a development stage company  sangart does not have any revenues from product sales 
since inception  the company has recorded sangart losses of  resulting from product development expenses and sangart s overhead costs 
sangart became a consolidated subsidiary in  the net book value of the company s investment in sangart was  at december  in  sangart commenced human clinical trials of mpox  a solution of cell free hemoglobin administered intravenously to provide rapid oxygen delivery to ischemic oxygen deprived tissues 
the basis for sangart s technology is the result of more than years of research in the understanding of how hemoglobin the oxygen carrier in red blood cells functions outside of red blood cells in a cell free environment and how it can be used in conjunction with normal red blood cells to enhance oxygen delivery to organ tissue 
mp products are made from purified human hemoglobin that is extracted from fully screened and tested outdated human blood obtained from accredited blood centers  which is then bound to polyethylene glycol molecules using sangart s proprietary processes 
sangart s m anufacturing process is able to generate approximately four units of mpox using a single unit of blood 
sangart owns or exclusively licenses sixteen us patents and has more than thirty applications pending worldwide covering product composition  manufacturing or methods of use 
patents applicable to the mp technology do not begin to expire until sangart has completed seven phase i and phase ii human clinical studies designed to assess product safety and gather preliminary indications of the product s effectiveness 
in and  sangart conducted two phase iii clinical trials that involved a total of hip replacement surgery patients in europe 
these studies demonstrated mpox s effectiveness in preventing and treating low blood pressure during orthopedic hip replacement surgeries without significant safety concerns being identified  though in one of the phase iii studies there was a slightly higher incidence of adverse events in the mpox treated patients than in the control group 
however  because these phase iii trials were conducted in a patient population having a relatively low incidence of medical complications  sanga rt decided not to apply for marketing approval to use mpox in orthopedic hip replacement surgeries following completion of those studies 
during  sangart completed a phase ii proof of concept clinical trial of mpox in trauma patients in europe and south africa 
study results were considered to be successful and would support the conduct of a larger phase ii clinical study in trauma patients  which could commence in the first half of if this larger phase ii study were to be successful  sangart would have to conduct phase iii clinical studies in trauma patients 
the phase ii and phase iii trauma studies would take several years to complete at substantial cost 
until these phase ii and phase iii studies are successfully completed  sangart will not be able to request marketing approval and generate revenues from sales in the trauma market 
sangart is also exploring the application of the mp technology in additional therapeutic areas 
one area of interest is sickle cell disease  for which sangart s mpco product has been granted orphan drug designation by the european commission and us food and drug administration 
if sangart is able to successfully obtain marketing approval  these designations will provide mpco with market exclusivity for ten years in the european union and seven years in the united states 
multiple human clinical trials demonstrating the safety and efficacy of mpco in the treatment of sickle cell disease would need to be successfully completed before marketing approval can be obtained and revenues from mpco sales can be generated 
such studies would take several years to complete at substantial co st 
substantially all of the funding needed for mp development has come from sales of sangart s equity securities 
the company provided sangart with  of additional equity funds during  and expects to provide sangart with sufficient capital through the end of  though it is under no obligation to do so 
thereafter  significant additional funding will be needed for product development and clinical trial activities prior to regulatory approval and commercial launch  the source of such funding has not as yet been determined 
competitive environment mp products are intended to be used as oxygen therapeutic agents in clinical and trauma situations where tissues are at risk of inadequate blood flow and oxygenation 
currently there are no similar products approved for sale in the us or the european union  however  other companies are developing products that could potentially compete with mp any successful commercialization of mp products will depend on an adequate supply of raw materials  principally human red blood cells and polyethylene glycol  at an acceptable quality  quantity and price 
sangart has contracted for a supply of human red blood cells that is expected to be sufficient to produce mp at volumes needed for a commercial launch  however  if the product is successful additional sources of red blood cells will be needed to support sales growth 
commitments for quantities of polyethylene glycol to support a commercial launch have not yet been secured 
sangart leases a  square foot combination office and manufacturing facility that currently produces mp products for its clinical trials 
sangart believes that its current manufacturing facility would have adequate capacity to support a commercial launch  but significant capital improvements would be required or an alternative manufacturing site would need to be acquired for commercial production 
in addition to obtaining requisite regulatory approvals and increasing manufacturing capacity for the manufacture and sale of mp products  sangart would have to create sales  marketing and distribution capabilities prior to any commercial launch of this product  either directly or in partnership with a service provider 
government regulation as a product intended for medical use  clinical trials  marketing approval  manufacturing and distribution of mp is highly regulated 
an application for marketing approval may only be made after the safety and effectiveness of the product has been demonstrated  including through human clinical trial data 
in the us  the us food and drug administration regulates medical products  including the category known as biologics  which includes mp products 
the federal food  drug and cosmetic act and the public health service act govern the testing  manufacture  safety  effectiveness  labeling  storage  record keeping  approval  advertising and promotion of mp products 
in europe  each country has its own agency that regulates clinical trials 
however  the committee for medicinal products for human use chmp  which is administered by the european medicines agency  is an eu wide regulatory body 
following completion of clinical trials  marketing approval can be granted either by a centralized application through chmp  or on a decentralized basis by one or more selected countries

demand for wine in the premium  ultra premium and luxury market segments can rise and fall with general economic conditions  and is also significantly affected by grape supply 
the demand for crimson s products is also affected by the ratings given the wines in industry and consumer publications 
in the current economic climate  consumer demand has shifted away from the higher priced luxury segment to wines in the lower priced premium and ultra premium categories 
while crimson s current vineyard holdings in the napa  willamette and edna valleys continue to be a substantial source for its wine products  crimson has and will continue to acquire more purchased fruit as it shifts its product offerings to the lower priced wine segments

although there are a number of large scale projects the company is currently investigating  the company is not obligated to develop any of the projects  and no assurance can be given that the company will be successful in fully developing any of these projects 
any project that the company might develop would likely require a significant equity investment  which the company presently does not intend to fund by itself  the acquisition of substantial non recourse borrowings to build the projects total development costs for these types of projects range from billion to billion  the procurement of purchase commitments for long term supplies of feedstock  long term commitments from purchasers of the output  various permits and regulatory approvals and significant technological and engineering expertise to implement 
 the investigation  evaluation and financing of these large scale projects will take years to complete

while some master servicer functions may be sub contracted and performed by a primary servicer  as a master servicer berkadia is ultimately responsible for the performance of any functions that have been sub contracted to a primary servicer 
master servicers are generally required to advance funds to cover any delinquent payments on the securitized loans and any taxes and insurance premiums not paid by borrowers or covered by borrowers escrow funds  provided that the servicer determines that the advances will be recoverable from loan payments or liquidation proceeds in the future 
these servicing advances  along with accrued interest  are treated as having priority over the rights of other investors in the securitization 
in certain circumstances  berkadia may have similar obligations to advance funds in connection with loans under which it is a primary servicer 
a special servicer is a specialist in dealing with defaulted loans and is usually selected by the holder of the subordinated interest in a securitization vehicle 
typically  a loan may be transferred from the master servicer to a special servicer if it is more than days delinquent  a borrower files for bankruptcy or the master servicer determines a default is imminent 
once a loan is transferred to special servicing  asset managers take steps to bring the account to a performing status or exercise other remedies  including loan modification  foreclosure  a negotiated pay off or a sale of the loan 
special servicers are generally paid higher monthly servicing fees and resolution fees in connection with the loans that they service 
fee for service customers generally require the same type of collection  monitoring and reporting services as other programs  however  since the customer retains ownership of the loan there are no third party bondholders or investors 
in addition  the mortgage servicing rights are not purchased  instead the customer contracts with berkadia to service its loans 
the contract usually has a defined term and may be terminated on short notice

provided berkadia adheres to the underwriting guidelines  these government related entities must purchase the loan at the face amount plus accrued interest  berkadia retains the mortgage servicing rights 
in addition  as a condition to fannie mae s delegation of responsibility for underwriting  originating and servicing of loans  berkadia assumes a limited first dollar loss position throughout the term of each loan sold to fannie mae

berkadia expects to hold cmbs loans for to months pending sale to a securitization vehicle and bridge loans for up to year pending refinance 
berkadia intends that a maximum of  of cmbs loans and bridge loans will be outstanding at any one time 
berkadia is required under its servicing agreements to maintain certain minimum servicer ratings or qualifications from the rating agencies 
a downgrade below a certain level may give rise to the right of a customer or trustee of a securitized transaction to terminate berkadia as servicer

in exchange for its cash investment  the company received  common shares of fortescue  and a  unsecured note of fmg that matures in august in the first quarter of  the company sold  common shares for net cash proceeds of  reducing its interest in fortescue to  common shares approximately of fortescue s outstanding common shares 
interest on the note is calculated as of the revenue  net of government royalties  invoiced from the iron ore produced from the project s cloud break and christmas creek areas 
fortescue is a publicly tra ded company on the australian stock exchange  and the shares acquired by the company may be sold without restriction on the australian stock exchange or in accordance with applicable securities laws

at december   the market value of the fortescue common shares was  interest on the fmg note is payable semi annually within days of june th and december st of each year  however  cash interest payments due in and were deferred by fmg due to covenants contained in the project s senior secured debt for periods prior to january

during  the company received  before withholding taxes from fmg in payment of accrued interest due through june  in january  the company received  before withholding taxes from fmg in payment of interest due for the second half of the ultimate value of the note will depend on the volume of iron ore shipped and iron ore prices over the remaining term of the note  which can fluctuate widely  as well as the outcome of the litigation described below 
the company s initial fortescue investment was allocated to the common shares acquired  using the market value on the acquisition date  a year zero coupon note and a prepaid mining interest 
the zero coupon note component of this investment is being accounted for as a loan like instrument  with income being recognized as the note is accreted up to its face value of  using a rate of

on august   the company was advised that fortescue is asserting that fmg is entitled to issue additional notes identical to the fmg note in an unlimited amount 
fortescue further claims that any interest to be paid on additional notes can dilute  on a pro rata basis  the company s entitlement to the stated interest of of net revenue 
this claim was made four years after the issuance to the company of the fmg note  during which time fortescue has never asserted this purported right to dilute the company s interest in any of fortescue s public filings or other communications 
the company does not believe that fmg has the right to issue additional notes which affect the company s interest or that the interpretation by fortescue of the terms of the fmg note  as currently c laimed by fortescue  reflects the agreement between the parties 
on september   the company filed a writ of summons against fortescue  fmg and fortescue s chief executive officer in the supreme court of western australia 
the writ of summons seeks  among other things  an injunction restraining the issuance of any additional notes identical to the fmg note and damages

when it was first proposed the extra tax burden did have an adverse impact on the market value of the fortescue common shares held by the company 
as currently proposed the tax will not have any impact on the calculation of the interest payable on the fmg note 
further  based on the company s review of available information concerning the proposed tax and its anticipated impact on fortescue  the company does not believe the pr oposed tax is so onerous as to cause a liquidity problem for fmg resulting in fmg s inability to service its debt obligations  including the fmg note 
the company does not believe that its zero coupon note or prepaid mining interest are impaired or will become impaired as a result of the proposed tax

au  which contains substantial additional information about fortescue  its operating activities and the project 
fortescue shipped its first iron ore in may and for the year ending december   fortescue s total revenue from iron ore sales was  fortescue announced reserve estimates for the cloud break and christmas creek areas  which are net of mine depletion and ore recovery  include million metric tons of proved iron ore reserves and billion metric tons of probable iron ore reserves  in accordance with the australasian joint ore reserves committee code 
this reserve estimate is solely for these two areas  which cover an area of approximately square kilometers 
fortescue has additional tenements in the pilbara region of western australia and has since announced reserve estimates for some of its other tenements 
although fortescue has received all major approvals required under the various governmental  environmental  and native title processes for the cloud break and christmas creek tenements  it does not possess all of the appro vals for mining activities at its other tenements 
mining revenues derived from tenements other than cloud break and christmas creek do not increase the interest payable to the company on the fmg note 
fortescue s initial feasibility study was commissioned to identify a quantity and quality of iron ore that would support an initial mine plan that produces million metric tons per annum for a year period 
in fortescue launched a self funded expansion program to increase its base mining plan to million metric tons per annum from cloud break and christmas creek that it expects to begin commissioning in the first quarter of in fortescue announced a further expansion to increase its mining plan to million metric tons per annum  of which million metric tons per annum will come from cloud break and christmas creek 
since the benchmark pricing system that historically determined iron ore prices collapsed in  fortescue has followed the lead of the largest iron ore pro ducers and is charging its customers prices based on an index pricing regime that reflects recent iron ore spot prices 
in addition to the company s investment and equity investments from other parties  fortescue initially raised  of senior secured debt to fund the construction of its infrastructure  which included a kilometer railroad  port and related port infrastructure at port hedland  australia  as well as a crushing and screening plant  access roads and other infrastructure at the mine site

the weak us housing market during the last few years has resulted in fewer new housing starts  which has adversely impacted revenues and profitability at idaho timber 
idaho timber does not expect to return to prior levels of profitability until the us housing market recovers 
the prices and availability of key raw materials affects the profitability of our manufacturing operations  and also impacts sangart s ability to conduct its clinical trials 
although the company s operating subsidiaries are not currently experiencing any shortage of raw materials  if the subsidiaries experience shortages  revenues and profitability of the manufacturing subsidiaries would decline 
sangart has access to sufficient raw materials to conduct its clinical trials  however  it has not secured commitments for sufficient raw materials for a commercial launch  which would also require additional investments in manufacturing capacity 
in addition  the cost of polypropylene  the principal raw material used by conwed plastics  has increased by approximately from the price of polypropylene has historically fluctuated with the price of oil and natural gas but growing economies in china and india have resulted in increased demand and impacted prices 
keen s revenues and profitability are impacted by natural gas and oil supplies and prices and the supply of drilling rigs in the marketplace 
during periods of decreased demand for natural gas and oil  keen s rig utilization will decline and keen s competitors may also have excess capacity in the marketplace  which adversely impacts keen s revenues and profitability 
the lack of liquidity in the capital markets could adversely affect exploration  production and development activities of keen s customers  which could cause a reduction in keen s rig utilization and profitability 
the combination of low natural gas prices  the volatility and level of oil prices and the lack of liquidity in the capital markets could force keen s customers to reduce drilling programs  impair their ability to sustain their current level of operations and could adversely impact their ability to meet their cash obligations 
in addition to reduced rig utilization and profitability  which could result in impairment charges for certain rigs  difficulties experienced by keen s customers could increase keen s bad debt ex pense 
the nature of keen s operating activities can be hazardous  and accidents can cause personal injury or death  damage to keen s equipment and or environmental damage 
these hazards are inherent in the contract drilling business  and if keen is not fully protected through insurance coverage or indemnification from its customers any such accidents could adversely impact keen s profitability 
keen maintains insurance coverage and has indemnification agreements with many of its customers  however  there is no assurance that such insurance or indemnification agreements would adequately protect keen against liability or loss from all consequences of any accidents 
additionally  keen may not be able to purchase insurance economically 
new technologies could cause keen s drilling equipment and methods to become less competitive  resulting in reduced profitability or a requirement to make significant capital investments to remain competitive 
improvements in drilling technology could cause keen to become less competitive  lose business  suffer reduced profitability or result in impairment charges with respect to its drilling equipment 
when drilling pursuant to footage or turnkey contracts  keen could incur unexpected cost overruns which could negatively impact keen s profitability 
keen typically provides contract drilling services under daywork contracts under which keen s customers assume most of the risks associated with drilling operations 
if keen enters footage or turnkey contracts  keen is paid a fixed amount  regardless of the time required or operational problems encountered 
keen typically pays more of the out of pocket operating costs on a footage or turnkey contract versus daywork contract 
the hard rock biloxi is dependent upon patronage of persons living in the gulf coast region 
the hard rock biloxi primarily seeks to attract patrons from its local geographic area 
downturns in local and regional economic conditions  an increase in competition in the surrounding area and interruptions caused by hurricanes could negatively impact operating results 
we may not be able to insure certain risks economically 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to insure all risks that we desire to insure economically or that all of our insurers or reinsurers will be financially viable if we make a claim 
if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits should occur  or if the company is required to pay a deductible for an insured loss  results of operations could be adversely affected 
premier has been severely damaged by hurricanes in the past  and it is possible that storms could cause significant damage in the future 
damages from storms could result in premier closing its facility to make repairs  resulting in lost business and adversely affecting results of operations 
increases in mortgage interest rate levels  the lack of available consumer credit and the depressed real estate market have reduced and may continue to reduce consumer demand for certain of our real estate development projects and result in impairment charges 
due to current depressed economic conditions in the national real estate market  most of the company s real estate development projects are not being marketed for sale 
if the company begins to market its development projects in the future  the ability to successfully attract customers will be highly dependent upon consumers ability to finance real estate purchases with affordable loans 
if the company is unable to realize its projected cash flows for its development projects  i mpairment charges are likely 
sangart is subject to extensive government regulation  cannot generate any revenue without regulatory approval of its products and is also subject to all of the risks inherent in establishing a new business 
the company has invested approximately  in sangart  principally to help fund sangart s product development activities 
while these funds are generally expensed by sangart when spent  the company cannot be assured that it will ever receive a return on its investment due to the risky nature of sangart s development activities 
clinical trials of sangart s product candidates are not complete  the products have not been approved for sale by regulatory authorities and there is a risk that its products may never prove e ffective or be approved 
there are other companies developing products for the same market that sangart is targeting  and if they are successful in bringing their product to market before sangart it may significantly impair sangart s ability to compete in the same market segment 
even if sangart is successful in obtaining regulatory approval to sell its products  competitors may receive approval prior to sangart and or have more effective products which could reduce demand for sangart s products 
sangart s success depends on its ability to obtain  maintain and defend patent protection for its products and technologies  preserve trade secrets and operate without infringing on the intellectual property rights of others 
the patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies  such as sangart  are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
if sangart s intellectual property positions are challenged  invalidated  circumvented or expire  or if sangart fails to maintain its third party intellectual property licenses in good standing  its ability to successfully bring mp products to market would be adversely affected  it could incur monetary liabilities or be required to cease using the technology or product in dispute 
sangart will require significant additional funding for product development and clinical trial activities prior to regulatory approval and commercial launch  the source of such funding has not been identified 
the company expects to provide sangart with sufficient capital through the end of sangart has had discussions with third party investors  however  no agreements have been reached and if such agreements are entered into it would likely result in significant dilution of the company s interest 
the company has not determined whether it will continue to provide funds to sangart and if so how much it will provide 
if sangart is not provided with additional funds from either the company or other sources when needed  it is unlikely that the company will ever realize any significant return of its invested capital 
the company has incurred costs to investigate and evaluate the development of a number of large scale energy projects  however  development of these projects is subject to obtaining significant third party debt and equity financing  regulatory approvals  the procurement of purchase commitments for long term supplies of feedstock and securing long term commitments from purchasers of the output 
although the company has spent material amounts in the investigation of large scale energy projects  it will not be able to develop these projects without financing from other sources  various regulatory approvals and commitments from third parties 
the timing of the commencement of construction of any project is also dependent upon the receipt of financing and regulat ory approvals 
if the company is unable to obtain such financing  approvals or commitments  it will not be able to recover its investment 
if berkadia does not maintain certain specified ratings from the credit rating agencies it could lose its mortgage servicing rights 
berkadia is required to maintain specified ratings from the credit rating agencies  and failure to do so would give its customers the right to terminate their mortgage servicing agreements 
if mortgage servicing agreements were terminated as a result of a credit ratings downgrade  the company could lose its entire equity investment and may be exposed to loss for some or all of its exposure on the berkadia secured credit facility 
when berkadia originates loans for fannie mae  it is often required to share in the losses on such loans  which could be in excess of reserved amounts 
berkadia carries a reserve on its balance sheet for contingent losses on loans originated for fannie mae that have loss sharing requirements 
if actual losses exceed amounts reserved  berkadia s profitability and cash flows will be reduced 
the loss of or changes in berkadia s relationships with us government sponsored enterprises and federal agencies would have an adverse effect on berkadia s business 
berkadia s status as an approved seller servicer for fannie mae and freddie mac and its status as an fha approved mortgagee and issuer of ginnie mae mortgage backed securities afford berkadia a number of advantages 
berkadia s failure to comply with the applicable us government sponsored enterprise or agency standards financial and otherwise may result in its termination as an approved seller servicer  mortgagee or issuer 
the loss of any such status could have a material adverse impact on berkadia s results of operations  could result in a loss of similar approvals from other us government sponsored enterprises or federal agencies and could have other adverse consequences to the business 
fannie mae and freddie mac retain broad discretion to terminate berkadia as a seller servicer without cause upon notice 
changes in existing government sponsored and federal mortgage programs could negatively affect berkadia s business 
berkadia s ability to generate income through mortgage sales to institutional investors depends in part on programs sponsored by fannie mae  freddie mac and the fha  which facilitate the issuance of mortgage backed securities in the secondary market 
these programs have been reduced in recent periods due to current economic conditions 
any discontinuation of  or significant reduction in  the operation of those programs could have a material adverse effect on berkadia s loan origination and servicing business and results of operations 
also  any significant adverse change in the level of activity in the se condary market or the underwriting criteria of these entities could negatively impact berkadia s results of operations and cash flows 
berkadia s special servicing and fee for service businesses may be terminated on short notice 
special servicing for each cmbs transaction is usually controlled by the subordinated bond holder class of the securitization 
the owners of the subordinated bonds may change from time to time  and subordinated bond holders may replace berkadia with a different special servicer 
fee for service customers are permitted to terminate berkadia on short notice  usually days 
if berkadia loses special servicing rights or is terminated by fee for service customers  it would negatively impact berkadia s results of operations and cash flows 
proposed cmbs and bridge loan programs will expose berkadia to credit and interest rate risk that it is not subject to with its government agency lending programs 
unlike its government agency lending programs  berkadia cannot be assured it will be able to sell cmbs and bridge loans at par value to a third party without any exposure to credit or interest rate risk 
if for any reason berkadia is unable to sell a cmbs loan into the securization market or refinance a bridge loan  it will retain all risks associated with such loan for as long as it owns the loan 
berkadia may be forced to sell such loans to a third party at a discount  which would reduce berkadia s profitability and cash flows 
berkadia s business is significantly affected by general economic conditions  particularly in the commercial real estate industry  and could be harmed in the event of a continued economic slowdown  prolonged recession or other market downturn or disruption 
berkadia s business and earnings are sensitive to changes in government policies and regulations  changes in interest rates  inflation  deflation  oversupply of real estate properties  fluctuations in the real estate and debt capital markets and developments in national and local economies 
unfavorable economic conditions could have an adverse effect on berkadia s business  including decreasing the demand for new loans and the servicing of loans originated by third parties 
the company has a substantial investment in jefferies  an investment banking and securities firm whose operating results are greatly affected by the economy and financial markets 
although jefferies operating results showed great improvement during the last two years  during  turmoil in the equity and credit markets had an adverse effect on the volume and size of transactions jefferies executed for its customers  resulting in reduced revenues and profitability in its investment banking  asset management and trading activities  as well as losses in its principal trading activities 
future declines in jefferies operating results caused by these or other conditions could adversely affect the value of the company s investment 
new financial legislation could affect the market value of the company s investment in jefferies 
recently adopted legislation in the us will result in more comprehensive regulation of the financial services industry 
such regulation could have an adverse impact on the market value of the company s investment in jefferies 
the company has substantial investments in fortescue and inmet  entities which are engaged in the mining of base metals principally iron ore and copper  the prices of which have been volatile and can reduce the value of the company s investments 
the value of the company s investment in the base metals mining sector rise and fall with the changes in the underlying base metal prices 
in addition  mining operations are often subject to delay and regulatory scrutiny  which can increase costs or delay bringing mines into full production 
pricing changes and mining delays have a direct impact on the value of the company s investments  and could adversely impact results of operations and equity 
the value of the fmg note could be materially reduced if the company loses its litigation against fortescue 
if the litigation is ultimately determined adversely to the company and additional notes are issued  the company s future cash flows from the fmg note and future results of operations would be materially and adversely affected to the extent of the dilution resulting from the issuance of such additional notes 
in addition  depending upon the extent of any such dilution  the company might have to record an impairment charge for its prepaid mining interest 
a minerals resource rent tax was proposed in australia that if enacted by the australian legislature could adversely impact the value of the company s investment in fortescue s common shares 
meetings between australian government officials and mining companies in australia are ongoing  and the initial proposal has changed and remains subject to further change 
when it was first proposed the extra tax burden did have an adverse impact on the market value of the fortescue common shares held by the company 
as currently proposed  the tax will not have any impact on the calculation of the interest payable on the fmg note 
the company s investment in fortescue s common shares could decline if and when the tax is enac ted  depending upon its final form 
garcadia s business is dependent  in part  upon revenue from new and used car sales at its dealerships  and declines in revenues due to industry or other factors could result in reduced profitability  reduced cash flows and or impairment charges 
garcadia has recorded impairment charges in the past  principally for goodwill and other intangible assets  and if the automobile industry experiences a downturn in the future additional impairment charges are likely 
in addition  reduced revenues would result in reduced profitability and cash flows for the company 
from time to time the company may invest in illiquid securities that are subject to standstill agreements or otherwise restricted 
from time to time the company may invest in securities that are subject to restrictions which prohibit the company from selling the securities for a period of time 
currently  the company s investment in inmet is subject to a voting and support agreement that prohibits the company from selling its inmet shares during the pendency of inmet s merger transaction with lundin 
the voting and support agreement will terminate if the merger is not completed by june  should the company need to generate liquidity quickly  the agreement would limit the company s ability to dispose of this inv estment while the agreement is effective 
the company has significant investments in publicly traded securities and changes in the market prices of these securities  particularly during times of increased volatility in security prices  can have a material impact on the company s investment portfolio  equity and  for certain investments  on results of operations 
the company has significant investments in publicly traded securities  principally fortescue  jefferies and inmet  and in jhyh  an operating business that typically owns publicly traded securities 
changes in the market values of publicly traded available for sale securities  such as fortescue and inmet  are reflected in other comprehensive income loss and equity but not in the consolidated statement of operations 
however  changes in the market value of jefferies  for which the company has elected the fair value option  declines in the fair values of equity securities that the company deems to be other than temporary and declines in the fair values of debt securities related to credit losses are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations and equity 
the company s investment in jhyh is accounted for on the equity method of accounting for which the company records its share of jhyh s profits or losses in its consolidated statements of operations 
to the extent that jhyh owns public securities  with changes in market values reflected in its earnings  this increases the company s exposure to volatility in the public securities markets 
global securities markets have been highly volatile  and continued volatility may have a material negative impact on the company s consolidated financial position and results of operations 
changes in government tax policies in foreign or domestic jurisdictions where the company has investments could have an adverse impact on the value of those investments 
the company has significant investments in both domestic and foreign businesses  where local and national government tax policies in the jurisdictions where those businesses operate could have a material adverse impact on the value of those investments 
government budget deficits may result in legislation to increase or add new taxes on businesses  in particular the domestic financial services and foreign mining sectors 
the company has equity investments and or loans to businesses operating in those sectors  and the announcement of unfavorable taxation policy or regulation for those businesses has had and could continue to have an adverse impact on the values of those investments  and reduce cash flows to the company 
current economic conditions have adversely affected most of the company s operations and investments 
a worsening of current economic conditions or a prolonged recession could cause a decline in estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by certain of the company s operations and investments  potentially resulting in impairment charges for long lived assets 
certain of the company s operating businesses and investments have significant investments in long lived assets  in particular manufacturing  oil and gas drilling services and gaming entertainment 
current economic conditions have resulted in declining revenues for these operations and their property and equipment is not being fully utilized 
as required  the company will review certain of these assets and investments for potential impairment  and except as otherwise disclosed has not concluded that the book values of these long lived assets are not recoverable 
if the operating revenues of these businesses deteriorate in the future  and or the company lowers its estimates of future cash flows  impairment charges might have to be recorded 
we could experience significant increases in operating costs and reduced profitability due to competition for skilled management and staff employees in our operating businesses 
the company competes with many other entities for skilled management and staff employees  including entities that operate in different market sectors than the company 
costs to recruit and retain adequate personnel could adversely affect results of operations 
from time to time we are subject to litigation  for which we may be unable to accurately assess our level of exposure and which if adversely determined  may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
the company and its subsidiaries are or may become parties to legal proceedings that are considered to be either ordinary  routine litigation incidental to their business or not material to the company s consolidated financial position or liquidity 
however  adverse determinations in specific legal matters could have a material adverse impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
we may not be able to generate sufficient taxable income to fully realize our deferred tax asset 
at december   we have recognized a net deferred tax asset of  if we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income  we will not be able to fully realize the recorded amount of the net deferred tax asset  or if we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of our nols  the nols would expire unused 
the company s projections of future taxable income required to fully realize the recorded amount of the net deferred tax asset reflect numerous assumptions about our operating businesses and investments  and are subject to change as conditions change specific to our business units  investments or g eneral economic conditions 
changes that are adverse to the company could result in the need to increase the deferred tax asset valuation allowance resulting in a charge to results of operations and a decrease to total stockholders equity

although the company paid a dividend in  it did not pay any dividend in or the company does not have a regular dividend policy and any dividends actually paid are determined each year by the board of directors 
our common shares are subject to transfer restrictions 
we and certain of our subsidiaries have significant nols and other tax attributes  the amount and availability of which are subject to certain qualifications  limitations and uncertainties

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the purpose of this section is to discuss and analyze the company s consolidated financial condition  liquidity and capital resources and results of operations 
this analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  related footnote disclosures and cautionary statement for forward looking information  which appear elsewhere in this report 
liquidity and capital resources general the company s investment portfolio  equity and results of operations can be significantly impacted by the changes in market values of certain securities  particularly during times of increased volatility in security prices 
changes in the market values of publicly traded available for sale securities are reflected in other comprehensive income loss and equity 
however  changes in the market prices of investments for which the company has elected the fair value option  declines in the fair values of equity securities that the company deems to be other than temporary and declines in the fair values of debt securities related to credit losses are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations and equity 
jhyh also owns public securities with changes in market values reflected in its earnin gs 
since the company accounts for jhyh on the equity method of accounting  it records its share of jhyh s earnings in the consolidated statement of operations which increases the company s exposure to volatility in the public securities markets 
the company s largest publicly traded available for sale equity securities with changes in market values reflected in other comprehensive income loss are fortescue and inmet 
during the year ended december   the market value of the company s investment in the common shares of fortescue increased from  excluding shares sold in to  the market value of the company s investment in inmet increased from  to  excluding shares acquired in  the aggregate market value of all the inmet shares owned by the company was  at december  the market value of the company s investment in jefferies  for which the fair value option was elected  increased during the year with unrealized gains reflected in op erations as a component of income related to associated companies 
during the year ended december   the company recognized an unrealized gain related to its investment in jefferies of  liquidity leucadia national corporation the parent is a holding company whose assets principally consist of the stock of its direct subsidiaries  cash and cash equivalents and other non controlling investments in debt and equity securities 
the parent continuously evaluates the retention and disposition of its existing operations and investments and investigates possible acquisitions of new businesses in order to maximize shareholder value 
accordingly  further acquisitions  divestitures  investments and changes in capital structure are possible 
its principal sources of funds are its available cash resources  liquid investments  public and private capital market transactions  repayment of subsidiary advances  funds distributed from its subsidiaries as tax sharing payments  management and other f ees  and borrowings and dividends from its subsidiaries  as well as dispositions of existing businesses and investments 
in addition to cash and cash equivalents  the company also considers investments classified as current assets and investments classified as non current assets on the face of its consolidated balance sheet as being generally available to meet its liquidity needs 
securities classified as current and non current investments are not as liquid as cash and cash equivalents  but they are generally easily convertible into cash within a relatively short period of time 
as of december   the sum of these amounts aggregated  however  since  of this amount is pledged as collateral pursuant to various agreements  is subject to trading restrictions  represents investments in non public securities or is held by subsidiaries that are party to agreements that restrict the company  s ability to use the funds for other purposes  the company does not consider those amounts to be available to meet the parent s liquidity needs 
the  that is available is comprised of cash and short term bonds and notes of the us government and its agencies  us government sponsored enterprises and other publicly traded debt and equity securities including the fortescue common shares of 
this amount does not include the company s investment in inmet s common shares  which is subject to trading restrictions as discussed below 
the parent s available liquidity  and the investment income realized from the parent s cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities is used to meet the parent company s short term recurring cash requirements  which are principally the payment of interest on its debt and corporate overhead expenses 
the parent s only long term cash requirement is to make principal payments on its long term debt  principal outstanding as of december   of which  is due in   is due in   is due in   is due in and  is due in historically  the parent has used its available liquidity to make acquisitions of new businesses and other investments  but  except as disclosed in this report  the timing of any future investments and the cost cannot be predicted 
from time to time in the past  the company has accessed public and private credit markets and raised capital in underwritten bond financings 
the funds raised have been used by the company for general corporate purposes  including for its existing businesses and new investment opportunities 
however  given the recent volatility in the credit markets  if and when the company decides to raise funds through an underwritten bond offering it might be at a higher interest rate than in the past  or with terms that the company may not find acceptable

this claim was made four years after the issuance to the company of the fmg note  during which time fortescue has never asserted this purported right to dilute the company s interest in any of fortescue s public filings or other communications 
the company does not believe that fmg has the right to issue additional notes which affect the company s interest or that the interpretation by fortescue of the terms of the fmg note  as currently c laimed by fortescue  reflects the agreement between the parties 
on september   the company filed a writ of summons against fortescue  fmg and fortescue s chief executive officer in the supreme court of western australia 
the writ of summons seeks  among other things  an injunction restraining the issuance of any additional notes identical to the fmg note and damages

when the company sold its former telecommunications subsidiary  wiltel communications group  llc wiltel in  wiltel s defined benefit pension plan was not transferred in connection with the sale 
at december   the company had recorded a liability of  on its consolidated balance sheet for wiltel s unfunded defined benefit pension plan obligation 
this amount represents the difference between the present value of amounts owed to former employees of wiltel referred to as the projected benefit obligation and the market value of plan assets set aside in segregated trust accounts 
since the benefits in this plan have been frozen  future changes to the unfunded benefit obligation are expected to principally result from benefit payments  changes in the market val ue of plan assets  differences between actuarial assumptions and actual experience and interest rates 
the company expects to make substantial contributions to the segregated trust account for the wiltel defined benefit pension plan in the future to reduce its plan liabilities and reduce administrative and insurance costs associated with the plan 
the company expects to contribute  to wiltel s defined benefit pension plan in the tax deductibility of contributions is not a primary consideration  principally due to the availability of the company s nols to otherwise reduce taxable income 
other than the expected contribution  the timing and amount of additional contributions are uncertain 
as of december   certain amounts for the wiltel plan are as follows dollars in thousands projected benefit obligation funded status balance sheet liability at december  deferred losses included in other comprehensive income loss discount rate used to determine the projected benefit obligation calculations of pension expense and projected benefit obligations are prepared by actuaries based on assumptions provided by management 
these assumptions are reviewed on an annual basis  including assumptions about discount rates  interest credit rates and expected long term rates of return on plan assets 
for the wiltel plan  the timing of expected future benefit payments was used in conjunction with the citigroup pension discount curve to develop a discount rate that is representative of the high quality corporate bond market 
this discount rate will be used to determine pension expense in holding all other assumptions constant  a change in this discount rate would affect pension expense by  and the benefit obligation by  the deferred losses in other comprehensive income loss primarily result from differences between the actual and assumed return on plan assets and changes in actuarial assumptions  including changes in discount rates and changes in interest credit rates 
deferred losses are amortized to expense if they exceed of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market value of plan assets as of the beginning of the year  such amount aggregated  at december  a portion of these excess deferred losses will be amortized to expense during based on an amortization period of twelve years 
the assumed long term rates of return on plan assets are based on the investment objectives of the plan  which are more fully discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements

all of these letters of credit expire before as discussed above the company and berkshire hathaway have agreed to share equally any losses incurred under berkadia s five year credit facility 
at december   the amount outstanding under the facility was  of which  was loaned by the company  accordingly  the company s outstanding exposure to losses under the facility was  critical accounting estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates all of these estimates and assumptions 
the following areas have been identified as critical accounting estimates because they have the potential to have a material impact on the company financial statements  and because they are based on assumptions which are used in the accounting records to reflect  at a specific point in time  events whose ulti mate outcome won t be known until a later date 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
income taxes the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its net deferred tax asset to the net amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
if in the future the company determines that it is more likely than not that the company will be able to realize its net deferred tax asset in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to increase the net deferred tax asset would increase income in such period 
if in the future the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its recorded net deferred tax asset  an adjustment to decrease the net deferred tax asset would be charged to income in such period 
the company is required to consider all available evidence  both positive and negative  an d to weight the evidence when determining whether a valuation allowance is required and the amount of such valuation allowance 
generally  greater weight is required to be placed on objectively verifiable evidence when making this assessment  in particular on recent historical operating results 
during the second half of  the company recorded significant unrealized losses on many of its largest investments  recognized other than temporary impairments for a number of other investments and reported reduced profitability from substantially all of its operating businesses  all of which contributed to the recognition of a pre tax loss of  in the consolidated statement of operations and a pre tax loss in other comprehensive income loss of  for the year ended december  additionally  the losses recognized by the company resulted in a cumulative loss in total comprehensive income loss during the three year period ending december  in assessing the realizability of the net deferred tax asset at december   the company concluded that its recent opera ting loss and the then current economic conditions worldwide be given more weight than its projections of future taxable income during the period that it has nols available  and be given more weight than the company s long track record of generating taxable income 
as a result  the company concluded that a valuation allowance was required against substantially all of the net deferred tax asset  and increased its valuation allowance in by  with a corresponding charge to income tax expense 
during  the company realized significant gains from the sale of certain investments  recorded significant unrealized gains in the fair values of other investments and began to experience modest improvement in the operating results in some business segments 
additionally  the company s cumulative taxable income for recent years became a positive amount  reflecting the realized gains on the sales of acf and las cruces during the fourth quarter of with this recent positive evidence the company gave greater weight to its revised projections of future taxable income  which consider significant unrealized gains in its investment portfolio  and to its long term historical ability to generate significant amounts of taxable income when assessing the amount of its required valuation allowance 
 as a result  the company was able to conclude that it is more likely than not that it will have future taxable income sufficient to realize a significant portion of the company s net deferred tax asset  accordingly   of the deferred tax valuation allowance was reversed as a credit to income tax expense on december  the company s estimate of future taxable income considered all available evidence  both positive and negative  about its operating businesses and investments  included an aggregation of individual projections for each material operating business and investment  estimated apportionment factors for state and local taxing jurisdictions and included all future years that the company estimated it would have available nols until 
the company believes that its estimate of future taxable income is reasonable but inherently uncertain  and if its current or future operations and investments generate taxable income different than the projected amounts  further adjustments to the valuation allowance are possible 
at december   the balance of the deferred tax valuation allowance was approximately   principally to reserve for nols of certain subsidiaries that are not available to offset income generated by other members of the company s consolidated tax return group 
the company also records reserves for contingent tax liabilities based on the company s assessment of the probability of successfully sustaining its tax filing positions 
impairment of long lived assets the company evaluates its long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate  in management s judgment  that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
when testing for impairment  the company groups its long lived assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities or asset group 
the determination of whether an asset group is recoverable is based on management s estimate of undiscounted future cash flows directly attributable to the asset group as compared to its carrying value 
if the carrying amount of the asset group is gr eater than the undiscounted cash flows  an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its estimated fair value 
one of the company s real estate subsidiaries mb has been the owner and developer of a mixed use real estate project located in myrtle beach  south carolina 
the project is comprised of a retail center with approximately  square feet of retail space   square feet of office space and residential apartment rental units

during the second quarter of  mb was unable to make scheduled payments under its interest rate swap agreement and received several default notices under its bank loan 
these events constituted a change in circumstances that caused the company to evaluate whether the carrying amount of mb s real estate asset was recoverable 
the company prepared cash flow models and utilized a discounted cash flow technique to determine the fair value of mb s real estate 
the most significant assumptions in the company s cash flow models were the discount rate and the capitalization rate used to estimate the selling price of the retail center  these rates were selected based on published reports of market conditions for similar properties 
based on its evaluation  the co mpany recorded an impairment charge of  during the second quarter of classified as selling  general and other expenses 
although mb s bank loan matured in october  it was not repaid since mb did not have sufficient funds and the company was under no obligation to provide the funds to mb to pay off the loan 
during the second quarter of  mb entered into an agreement with its lenders under which  among other things  mb agreed not to interfere with or oppose foreclosure proceedings and the lenders agreed to release mb and various guarantors of the loan 
a receiver was put in place at the property  foreclosure proceedings commenced and an auction of the property was conducted  however  the company was informed during the fourth quarter of that the highest bidder for the property failed to close 
in december  the company was invited to make a bid for the property  with the condition that a foreclosure sale to the company must close as soon as possible without any due diligence period  which new bidders for the property would require 
a subsidiary of the company offered  for the p roperty including net working capital amounts  the offer was accepted and the foreclosure sale closed on january  as a result of the failure of the initial buyer to purchase the property and the subsequent sale to the company in  the company concluded that the carrying value of the property was further impaired at december   accordingly  the company recorded an additional impairment charge in of  to reflect the property at its fair value of  at closing in  mb was released from any remaining liability under the bank loan  accordingly  the remaining balance due after payment of the purchase price  will be recognized in other income in the first quarter of including the cash paid in the foreclosure sale  the company s cumulative net cash investment in this project is  in addition to the mb impairments  during and  the company recorded impairment losses on long lived assets aggregating  and  respectively  classified as selling  general and other expenses

during  idaho timber discontinued remanufacturing of dimension lumber and experienced declining sales of certain specialty wood products at one of its plants  and as a result decided to close the plant 
idaho timber evaluated for impairment the plant s long lived assets  comprised of buildings  machinery and equipment  and customer relationships intangibles 
the carrying values of long lived assets held and used and intangible assets were written down to their fair values  determined using the present value of expected future cash flows 
the company wrote down certain real estate properties that are held f or sale for which the fair values were primarily based on appraisals or prices for similar assets 
the company also wrote down a real estate property that under gaap is considered to be held and used  but which the company has recently decided to sell 
the company wrote down this real estate property to fair value primarily using market information for similar assets 
during  the company recorded impairment losses on long lived assets aggregating  of which  related to its gaming entertainment segment   related to its real estate segment and  related to its other operations segment 
current economic conditions have adversely affected most of the company s operations and investments 
a worsening of current economic conditions or a prolonged recession could cause a decline in estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by the company s operations and investments 
if future undiscounted cash flows are estimated to be less than the carrying amounts of the asset groups used to generate those cash flows in subsequent reporting periods  particularly for those with large investments in property and equipment for example  manufacturing  gaming entertainment  land based contract oil and gas drilling operations  real estate and certain associated company investments  impairment charges would have to be recorded 
impairment of equity method investments the company evaluates equity method investments for impairment when operating losses or other factors may indicate a decrease in value which is other than temporary 
for investments in investment partnerships that are accounted for under the equity method  the company obtains from the investment partnership financial statements  net asset values and other information on a quarterly basis and annual audited financial statements 
on a quarterly basis  the company also makes inquiries and discusses with investment managers whether there were significant procedural  valuation  composition and other changes at the investee 
since these investment partnerships record their underlying investments at fair value  after application of the equity method the carrying value of the company s investment is equal to its share of the investees underlying net assets at their fair values 
absent any unusual circumstances or restrictions concerning these investments  which would be separately evaluated  it is unlikely that any additional impairment charge would be required 
for equity method investments in operating businesses  the company considers a variety of factors including economic conditions nationally and in their geographic areas of operation  adverse changes in the industry in which they operate  declines in business prospects  deterioration in earnings  increasing costs of operations and other relevant factors specific to the investee 
whenever the company believes conditions or events indicate that one of these investments might be materially impaired  the company will obtain from such investee updated cash flow projections and impairment analyses of the investee assets 
the company will use this information and  together with discussions with the investee s management  evaluate if the book value of its investment exceeds its fair value  and if so and the situat ion is deemed other than temporary  record an impairment charge 
during the second quarter of  the company s equity in losses of garcadia included impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets aggregating  garcadia s automobile dealerships had been adversely impacted by general economic conditions  and the bankruptcy filings by two of the three largest us automobile manufacturers was a change in circumstances that caused garcadia to evaluate the recoverability of its goodwill and other intangible assets 
garcadia prepared discounted cash flow projections for each of its dealerships and concluded that the carrying amount of its goodwill and other intangible assets was impaired 
for the year ended december   the company s equity in losses of ifis limited ifis includes impairment charges of  ifis is a private argentine company that owns a variety of investments  and its largest investment is ownership of common shares of cresud sociedad anonima comercial  inmobiliaria  financiera y agropecuaria cresud  an agricultural company primarily based in argentina 
during  as a result of significant declines in quoted market prices for cresud and other investments of ifis  combined with declines in worldwide food commodity prices  the global mortgage and real estate crisis and political and financial conditions in argentina  the company determined that its investment in ifis was impaired 
the fair value of the company  s investment in ifis was primarily based upon the quoted market prices of ifis s investments 
impairment of securities declines in the fair value of equity securities considered to be other than temporary and declines in the fair values of debt securities related to credit losses are reflected in net securities gains losses in the consolidated statements of operations 
the company evaluates its investments for impairment on a quarterly basis 
the company s determination of whether a security is other than temporarily impaired incorporates both quantitative and qualitative information  gaap requires the exercise of judgment in making this assessment  rather than the application of fixed mathematical criteria 
the various factors that the company considers in making its determination are specific to each investment 
for publicly traded debt and equity securities  the company considers a number of factors including  but not limited to  the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  the reason for the decline in fair value  changes in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date  the ability and intent to hold investments to maturity  and other factors speci fic to the individual investment 
for investments in private equity funds and non public securities  the company bases its determination upon financial statements  net asset values and or other information obtained from fund managers or investee companies 
the company has a portfolio of non agency mortgage backed bond securitizations  which were acquired at significant discounts to face amounts and are accounted for as acquisitions of impaired loans 
the company estimates the future cash flows for these securities to determine the accretable yield  increases in estimated cash flows are accounted for as a yield adjustment on a prospective basis but decreases in estimated cash flows below amortized cost due to credit losses are recognized as impairments in the consolidated statements of operations 
contractual cash flows in excess of estimated cash flows are not part of the accretable yield 
the market for these securities is highly illiquid and they rarely trade 
on a regular basis  the company re estimates the future cash flows of these secu rities and records impairment charges if appropriate 
the fair values for these securities are primarily determined using an income valuation model to calculate the present value of expected future cash flows  which incorporates assumptions regarding potential future rates of delinquency  prepayments  defaults  collateral losses and interest rates 
the company recorded the following impairment charges for securities in the consolidated statement of operations during the three year period ended december  in thousands publicly traded securities non public securities and private equity funds non agency mortgage backed bond securitizations totals for the year ended december   impairment charges for publicly traded securities include  related to the company s direct investment in cresud s american depository shares and cresud warrants 
the company s assessment involves a high degree of judgment and accordingly  actual results may differ materially from the company s estimates and judgments 
credit quality of financing receivables and allowance for credit losses the company s operating subsidiaries do not provide financing to their customers in the ordinary course of business 
however  the company does have an outstanding loan and an outstanding note that meet the accounting definition of a finance receivable at december  the  loan provided under the secured credit facility to its joint venture  berkadia  and its year unsecured zero coupon note of fmg  which had a balance of  at december  the company exercises judgment in evaluating the credit risk and collectability of these financing receivables 
these assessments were made prior to the inception of the credit exposure and continue to be made at regular intervals 
the various factors that the company considers in making its assessment are specific to each financing receivable 
these factors include the current and projected financial condition of those companies and their industries  the type and amount of collateral  if any  the company s collection experience and the length of time until these financing receivables become due 
as a result of its assessment  the company concluded that an allowance for credit losses was not required as of december  business combinations at acquisition  the company allocates the cost of a business acquisition to the specific tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their fair values 
significant judgments and estimates are often made to determine these values  and may include the use of appraisals  consider market quotes for similar transactions  employ discounted cash flow techniques or consider other information the company believes to be relevant 
the finalization of the purchase price allocation will typically take a number of months to complete  and if final values are materially different from initially recorded amounts adjustments are recorded 
any excess of the cost of a business acquisition over the fair v alues of the net assets and liabilities acquired is recorded as goodwill  which is not amortized to expense 
if the fair values of the net assets and liabilities acquired are greater than the purchase price  the excess is treated as a bargain purchase and recognized in income 
recorded goodwill of a reporting unit is required to be tested for impairment on an annual basis  and between annual testing dates if events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its net book value 
at december   the book value of goodwill was  and was not impaired when tested 
subsequent to the finalization of the purchase price allocation  any adjustments to the recorded values of acquired assets and liabilities would be reflected in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
once final  the company is not permitted to revise the allocation of the original purchase price  even if subsequent events or circumstances prove the company s original judgments and estimates to be incorrect 
in addition  long lived assets recorded in a business combination like property and equipment  amortizable intangibles and goodwill may be deemed to be impaired in the future resulting in the recognition of an impairment loss 
the assumptions and judgments made by the company when recording business combinations will have an impact on reported results of operations for man y years into the future 
during  the company acquired a limited liability company interest in keen for aggregate consideration of  excluding expenses  and agreed to lend to keen  on a senior secured basis  up to  to finance new rig equipment purchases and construction costs and to repay existing debt 
during  the company increased its equity interest to for additional payments aggregating  in addition  the credit facility was amended to increase the borrowing capacity to  and the company provided keen with two additional secured credit facilities aggregating  when the company increased its investment in keen to  the terms of the limited liability agreement were amended to provide that in the event of a dissolution  liquidation or termination of keen  available cash or assets would first be used to pay all of keen s debts including loans made by the company  then distributed to the company as a liquidation preference until it had received a return of its equity investment  before any payments were made to the other equity owner of keen 
during  the company believes it became apparent to the other equity owner of keen that keen would not be able to make scheduled debt payments to the company  and that the resulting payment default could result in a liquidation of keen 
in that event  the company s liquidation preference over equity distributions would result in very little  if any  distributions to the other equity owner of keen 
in november  the company purchased the other equity interest that it did not own plus a secured note payable to the other equity owner of keen for aggregate cash consideration of  the company believes it was able to acquire the remaining equity interest at this distressed price because of the expected payment default on keen s senior secured debt owed to the company an d the company s  preferred equity distribution in the event keen was liquidated 
when the company acquired the controlling interest in keen in november it became a consolidated subsidiary  prior to that time the investment in keen was classified as an investment in an associated company 
under gaap  upon consolidation the company was required to record keen s assets and liabilities at fair value  and was required to adjust the carrying value of the company s equity investment immediately prior to the acquisition to fair value 
due to the unique circumstances surrounding the company s acquisition described above  the fair value of the net assets acquired exceeded the amount paid by  the bargain purchase was recognized as a gain on the date of acquisition and included in investment and other income 
however  the fair value of the company  s equity interest immediately prior to the acquisition was less than its carrying value  accordingly the company included a charge of  in income losses related to associated companies to write down the pre acquisition carrying value of its investment in keen to fair value 
as of the date of acquisition  keen s assets principally consisted of cash and other current assets and property and equipment 
the company engaged an independent valuation and appraisal firm to assist in its determination of the fair value of keen s property and equipment  identifiable intangible assets  if any  and corresponding equity value  the fair values of cash and working capital were  property and equipment were  and keen s other assets and liabilities were not material 
the methods used to determine the fair values included estimating keen s business enterprise value  utilizing both discounted cash flow and market comparable based approaches 
property and equipment asset valuations included an analysis of depreciated replacement cost and curre nt market prices 
the company considered several factors to determine the fair value of property and equipment  including local market conditions  recent market transactions  the size  age  condition  utility and character of the property  the estimated cost to acquire replacement property  an estimate of depreciation from use and functional obsolescence and the remaining expected useful life of the assets 
excluding intercompany loans  keen s liabilities principally consisted of trade payables which were recorded at face value 
the most significant estimate made in recording the acquisition of keen was the amount recorded for property and equipment  principally drilling rigs and related equipment 
during  keen s revenue volume and profitability were adversely affected by the expiration of term contracts during a time of low gas prices  high levels of natural gas in storage and generally adverse economic conditions that have reduced the drilling activity of keen s customers 
if these trends continue and keen s revenues remain depressed  it is possible that the fair values of keen s property and equipment may decline  resulting in the recording of impairment charges in the future 
use of fair value estimates under gaap  fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
further  a fair value hierarchy prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques into three broad levels 
the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  the next priority to inputs that don t qualify as level inputs but are nonetheless observable  either directly or indirectly  for the particular asset or liability level  and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level 
over of the company s investment portfolio is classified as available for sale securities  which are carried at estimated fair value in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the estimated fair values are principally based on publicly quoted market prices level inputs  which can rise or fall in reaction to a wide variety of factors or events  and as such are subject to market related risks and uncertainties 
the company has a segregated portfolio of mortgage pass through certificates issued by us government agencies gnma and by us government sponsored enterprises fhlmc or fnma  which are carried on the balance sheet at their estimated fair value of  at december  although the markets that these types of securities trade in are generally active  marke t prices are not always available for the identical security 
the fair value of these investments are based on observable market data including benchmark yields  reported trades  issuer spreads  benchmark securities  bids and offers 
these estimates of fair value are considered to be level inputs  and the amounts realized from the disposition of these investments has not been materially different from their estimated fair values 
the company also has a segregated portfolio of non agency mortgage backed securities which are carried on the balance sheet at their estimated fair value of  although these securities trade in brokered markets  the market for these securities is sometimes inactive 
the fair values of these investments are based on bid and ask prices  quotes obtained from independent market makers and pricing services 
these estimates of fair values are also considered to be level inputs 
the fair values of the company s portfolio of non agency mortgage backed bond securitizations  which are primarily determined using an income valuation model to calculate the present value of expected future cash flows  are considered to be level inputs 
contingencies the company accrues for contingent losses when the contingent loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
estimates of the likelihood that a loss will be incurred and of contingent loss amounts normally require significant judgment by management  can be highly subjective and are subject to material change with the passage of time as more information becomes available 
estimating the ultimate impact of litigation matters is inherently uncertain  in particular because the ultimate outcome will rest on events and decisions of others that may not be within the power of the company to control 
the company does not believe that any of its current l itigation will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity  however  if amounts paid at the resolution of litigation are in excess of recorded reserve amounts  the excess could be material to results of operations for that period 
as of december   the company s accrual for contingent losses was not material 
results of operations substantially all of the company s operating businesses sell products or services that are impacted by general economic conditions in the us and to a lesser extent internationally 
poor general economic conditions have reduced the demand for products or services sold by the company s operating subsidiaries and or resulted in reduced pricing for products or services 
troubled industry sectors  like the residential real estate market  have had an adverse direct impact not only on the company s real estate segments  but have also had an adverse indirect impact on some of the company s other operating segments  including manufacturing and gaming entertainment 
the discussions below concerning revenue and profitability by segment consider current economic conditions and the impac t such conditions have had and may continue to have on each segment  however  should general economic conditions worsen and or if the country experiences a prolonged recession  the company believes that all of its businesses would be adversely impacted

in addition  revenues from the erosion control  packaging and carpet cushion markets declined in as some business was lost to competitors 
the primary raw material in conwed plastics products is a polypropylene resin  which is a byproduct of the oil refining process  whose price has historically fluctuated with the price of oil 
during  global demand for raw materials has also resulted in higher prices for polypropylene 
prices for polypropylene resin increased substantially in as compared to the prior year  which adversely affected gross margin  prices for polypropylene resin declined in as compared to the volatility of oil and natural gas prices along with current general economic conditions worldwide make it difficult to predict future raw material costs 
conwed plastics believes that the increased competition for raw materials by foreign nations will continue to impact raw material costs 
 in addition to managing resin purchases  conwed plastics has continued to improve its ability to reduce and or reuse scrap and will seek to further improve its manufacturing processes in order to increase raw material utilization 
gross margin declined in as compared to primarily due to raw material cost increases and greater amortization expense for intangible assets

revenues and other income expenses direct operating expenses interest salaries and incentive compensation depreciation and amortization selling  general and other expenses income loss before income taxes keen s revenue volume and profitability are significantly affected by the actual and anticipated price of natural gas and oil  levels of natural gas and oil in storage and the supply of drilling rigs available in the marketplace 
the exploration and production industry is cyclical and the level of exploration and production activity has historically been very volatile 
during periods of lower levels of drilling activity  price competition for drilling services tends to increase  which may result in reduced revenues and profitability  conversely  during periods of increased drilling activity  drilling rigs are in demand often resulting in higher prices and contractual commitments from customers to obtain exclusive use of a particular rig for a longer term 
although keen s rig utilization and dayrates increased throughout  its revenues and profitability were adversely impacted by continued low natural gas prices and high levels of natural gas in storage 
the negative impact of lower natural gas prices was partially offset by an increasing proportion of keen s customers using its rigs to drill for oil rather than natural gas 
in january  keen sold its older mechanical rigs  only three of these rigs were operating under contract at the end of the year 
during  these rigs generated revenues of  keen s revenues and profitability during were adversely affected by the same factors as during  as well as by tight credit markets  which forced many of its customers to make significant reductions in their drilling programs
