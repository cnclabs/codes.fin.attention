our forward looking statements can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors 
we discuss many of these risks  uncertainties and other factors in this annual report on form k in greater detail under the heading item a risk factors 
we caution investors that our business and financial performance are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties 
overview we are a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on the development and commercialization of monoclonal antibody based therapies for cancer and autoimmune diseases 
our lead product candidate  brentuximab vedotin sgn  is being developed for the treatment of diseases that express an antigen called cd present on multiple cancer types  including hodgkin lymphoma and systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma  or salcl 
we recently announced data from a pivotal clinical trial of brentuximab vedotin for patients with relapsed or refractory hodgkin lymphoma 
the trial was conducted under a special protocol assessment  or spa  with the us food and drug administration  or fda 
in the pivotal trial  percent of the patients achieved an objective response as assessed by an independent central review  which was the primary endpoint in the trial  and the median duration of response was weeks as assessed by independent central review and weeks as assessed by investigators 
thirty four percent of the patients participating in the pivotal trial achieved a complete remission 
we also recently reported data from a phase ii clinical trial of brentuximab vedotin for patients with relapsed or refractory salcl 
in the phase ii salcl trial  percent of the patients achieved an objective response as assessed by an independent central review  which was the primary endpoint in the trial 
the median duration of response for the phase ii salcl trial had not yet been reached at a median follow up on study of approximately six months 
fifty three percent of the patients in the phase ii salcl trial achieved a complete remission 
we recently submitted a biologics license application  or bla  to the fda seeking approval of brentuximab vedotin as a treatment for both relapsed or refractory hodgkin lymphoma and relapsed or refractory salcl 
brentuximab vedotin is empowered by our proprietary antibody drug conjugate  or adc  technology comprising highly potent synthetic drugs and stable linkers for attaching the drugs to monoclonal antibodies 
in addition  we have four other clinical stage programs sgn  asg me  dacetuzumab sgn  and sgn in september  we announced that our phase iib clinical trial of lintuzumab sgn in combination with low dose cytarabine chemotherapy in older patients with acute myeloid leukemia  or aml  did not meet its primary endpoint of extending overall survival 
as a result of the outcome of this trial  we have discontinued our lintuzumab development program 
in december  we entered into a collaboration agreement with millennium the takeda oncology company  or millennium  to develop and commercialize brentuximab vedotin 
under this collaboration  seattle genetics has retained all commercial rights for brentuximab vedotin in the united states and its territories and in canada  and millennium has commercial rights in the rest of the world 
we also have collaborations for our adc 
table of contents technology with a number of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  including bayer pharmaceuticals corporation  or bayer  celldex therapeutics  inc  or celldex  daiichi sankyo co  ltd  or daiichi sankyo  genentech  inc  a member of the roche group  or genentech  glaxosmithkline llc  or gsk  millennium  pfizer  inc  or pfizer  and psma development company llc  a subsidiary of progenics pharmaceuticals inc  or progenics  as well as adc co development agreements with agensys inc  an affiliate of astellas pharma inc  or agensys  and genmab a s  or genmab 
although we recently submitted a bla to the fda to seek approval of brentuximab vedotin as a treatment for both relapsed or refractory hodgkin lymphoma and relapsed or refractory salcl  we do not currently have any commercial products for sale 
our other product candidates are in relatively early stages of development 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
over the next several years  we expect that we will incur substantial expenses  primarily the result of activities related to the potential regulatory approval and commercialization of brentuximab vedotin  including preparation for commercial manufacturing 
we will also continue to invest in research  development and manufacturing as we plan to move toward potential commercialization of our other product candidates 
our commitment of resources to the approval and commercialization activities for brentuximab vedotin and the research and continued development and potential commercialization of our other product candidates may require us to raise substantial amounts of additional capital and our operating expenses will also likely increase as a result of such activities 
in addition  we may incur significant milestone payment obligations as our product candidates progress through clinical trials towards potential commercialization 
we expect that amounts earned from our collaboration agreements will continue to be an important source of our revenues 
until such time as we have successfully commercialized a product candidate  if ever  our revenues will also depend on the achievement of development and clinical milestones under our existing collaboration and license agreements  particularly our brentuximab vedotin collaboration with millennium  as well as entering into new collaboration and license agreements 
a substantial portion of our revenues in  and resulted from our dacetuzumab collaboration agreement with genentech 
this collaboration ended in and contributed approximately million of our revenue during the first half of our results of operations may vary substantially from year to year and from quarter to quarter and  as a result  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful and you should not rely on them as indicative of our future performance 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we believe the following critical accounting policies describe the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we have entered into licensing and collaboration agreements that contain multiple revenue elements including upfront payments  license fees  milestone payments  royalties  maintenance fees and payments for the delivery of supplies or services provided 
each agreement may contain some or all of these elements 
revenue recognition is predicated upon persuasive evidence of an agreement existing  delivery of materials or services being rendered  amounts payable being fixed or determinable  and collectibility being reasonably assured 
agreements that include multiple elements are evaluated to determine whether the associated deliverables can be considered separate units of accounting 
in order to be considered a separate unit of accounting  a deliverable must have standalone value to the customer and we must have objective and reliable evidence of its fair value 
to date  the deliverables under our collaboration agreements have not qualified as separate units of accounting and amounts received or due are typically recognized as revenue over our performance obligation period under each agreement 
we generally use a time based proportional performance model to recognize revenue over our performance period 
the assessment of multiple element arrangements requires judgment in order to determine the appropriate point in time  or period of time  that revenue should be recognized 

table of contents nonrefundable upfront license payments  option and maintenance fees and milestone payments our collaborative agreements may include nonrefundable upfront license payments  option and maintenance fees  and payments triggered by the achievement of development milestones by the other party or by us 
when we have substantive continuing performance obligations under an arrangement  revenue is recognized over the performance period of the obligations 
under the time based proportional performance method  revenue is recognized over the term of our estimated performance period under the agreement based on the elapsed time compared to the total estimated performance period 
changes in estimates of the total expected performance period are accounted for prospectively when a change becomes known 
revenue recognized at any point in time is limited to the amount of non contingent payments received or due 
when we have no substantive continuing performance obligations under an arrangement  we recognize revenue as the related fees become due 
research and development services we may also perform research and development activities on behalf of collaborative partners that are paid for by the collaborator 
if the arrangement provides for other ongoing performance obligations by us or contains multiple delivery elements which do not qualify as separate units of accounting  amounts due for such services are recognized as revenue over the performance period 
when no other obligation to provide services is required by us  revenue from research and development services is generally recognized as the service is provided 
royalties revenues from royalties on third party sales of licensed technologies are generally recognized in accordance with the contract terms when the royalties can be reliably determined and collectibility is reasonably assured 
to date  we have not received significant royalty revenues 
we generally invoice our collaborators on a monthly or quarterly basis  or upon the completion of the effort  based on the terms of each agreement 
amounts due  but not billed to a collaborator  if any  are included in accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheets 
deferred revenue arises from amounts received in advance of the culmination of the earnings process and is recognized as revenue in future periods when the applicable revenue recognition criteria have been met 
deferred revenue expected to be recognized within the next twelve months is classified as a current liability 
investments 
we have investments in a variety of debt securities in accordance with our investment policy 
we classify our investments as available for sale  which are reported at estimated fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders equity 
realized gains and losses and declines in value of investments judged to be other than temporary are included in investment income 
to date  we have not deemed it necessary to record any charges related to other than temporary declines in the estimated fair values of our marketable debt securities 
the fair value of our investments is subject to volatility 
declines in the fair value of our investments judged to be other than temporary could adversely affect our future operating results 
we estimate fair values in accordance with a hierarchy prescribed by gaap 
this hierarchy prioritizes the inputs and assumptions used  and the valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
as described below under liquidity and capital resources we use a probability weighted discounted cash flow analysis to value our investment in auction rate securities 
accrued expenses 
as part of the process of preparing financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves identifying services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of services performed and the associated costs incurred for such services where we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost 
we record these estimates in our consolidated financial statements as of each balance sheet date 
examples of estimated accrued expenses include fees due to contract research organizations and other costs in conjunction with clinical trials  fees due in conjunction with manufacturing our product candidates and professional service fees 

table of contents in accruing service fees  we estimate the time period over which services will be provided and the level of effort in each period 
if the actual timing of the provision of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate  we will adjust the accrual accordingly 
in the event that we do not identify costs that have been incurred or we under or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services  our actual expenses would differ from such estimates 
the date on which some services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date and the cost of such services are often subjective determinations 
we make judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us at the time and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist of salaries  benefits and other headcount related costs of our research and development staff  preclinical activities  clinical trials  lab supplies  manufacturing costs for product candidates used in research and clinical trials  contract and outside service fees and facilities and overhead expenses 
research and development activities are expensed as incurred 
in licensing fees  including milestones and maintenance fees  and other costs to acquire technologies that are utilized in research and development and that are not expected to have alternative future use are expensed when incurred 
we account for our clinical trial costs by estimating the total cost to treat a patient in each clinical trial and recognize this cost  based on a variety of factors  beginning with the preparation for the clinical trial  continuing through patient accrual into the clinical trial and completion of the clinical trial 
this estimated cost includes payments for clinical trial site and patient related costs  including laboratory costs related to the conduct of the trial  and other costs 
costs associated with activities performed under research and development co development collaborations are reflected in research and development expense 
non refundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are capitalized and recognized as expense as the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed 
share based compensation 
we expense the fair value of share based payment transactions in our consolidated financial statements 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of options on the date of grant which requires certain estimates to be made by management  including the expected forfeiture rate and expected term of the options 
management also makes decisions regarding the method of calculating the expected stock price volatility and the risk free interest rate used in the model 
fluctuations in the market that affect these estimates could have an impact on the resulting compensation cost 
income taxes 
we have net deferred tax assets which are fully offset by a valuation allowance due to our determination that it is more likely than not that the deferred assets will not be realized 
we believe that a full valuation allowance is appropriate as we expect to incur operating losses for at least the next several years as we continue to pursue the development of our product candidates 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be made  a portion of which would increase income or decrease losses in the period in which such a determination was made 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  investments  accrued expenses  research and development  share based compensation and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 

table of contents results of operations years ended december   and revenues total revenues in increased by to million from  and increased by in to million from our revenues reflect the earned portion of payments received under the dacetuzumab collaboration agreement with genentech entered into in january  our brentuximab vedotin collaboration agreement with millennium entered into in december  and our adc collaborations 
these payments include technology access and maintenance fees  milestone payments and reimbursement payments 
revenues are summarized by collaborator as follows collaboration and license agreement revenue by collaborator in thousands annual percentage change genentech millennium   n a gsk  n a n a agensys   n a daiichi sankyo other collaborators total no amount in comparable period 
our revenues are impacted by the term and duration of our collaboration agreements and by progress dependent milestones  annual maintenance fees and reimbursement of materials and support services as our collaborators advance their adc product candidates through the development process 
revenues may vary substantially from year to year and quarter to quarter depending on the progress made by our collaborators with their product candidates  the level of support we provide to our collaborators  the timing of milestones achieved  and our ability to enter into additional collaboration agreements 
we expect revenues related to millennium to increase as a result of the recognition of amounts earned as we fulfill our performance obligations under the brentuximab vedotin collaboration agreement 
however  total collaboration revenues are expected to be substantially lower in compared to as a result of revenue recognized in the first half of related to the dacetuzumab collaboration with genentech that has ended 
we have a significant balance of deferred revenue  representing prior payments from other collaborators that have not yet been recognized as revenue 
this deferred revenue will be recognized as revenue in future periods using a time based approach as we fulfill our performance obligations 
product collaboration agreements genentech revenues earned under our dacetuzumab and our adc collaborations with genentech represented of our total revenues in  of our total revenues in and of our total revenues in revenues from genentech increased in and reflecting amounts earned under the dacetuzumab collaboration entered into in january and its earlier than anticipated completion in under the terms of the dacetuzumab agreement  we received an upfront payment of million and progress dependent milestone payments of million 
genentech also funded ongoing research  development and manufacturing costs for dacetuzumab under the collaboration 
in december  genentech provided the 
table of contents requisite six month notice to us of its election to terminate the collaboration effective june  as a result  the remaining performance obligation period under the collaboration was shortened to six months 
all deferred revenue  representing payments received in advance of the culmination of the earnings process million as of december  was fully recognized as revenue using a time based method over the remaining term of the agreement 
genentech remains responsible for funding development costs associated with completing all clinical trials for dacetuzumab that were ongoing as of the effective date of termination 
these clinical trials have been substantially completed as of december  our adc collaboration with genentech was unaffected by this termination 
millennium in december  we entered into a collaboration agreement with millennium to develop and commercialize brentuximab vedotin  under which seattle genetics has commercial rights in the united states and its territories and canada  and millennium has commercial rights in the rest of the world 
under the collaboration  we received an upfront payment of million  and we are entitled to receive progress and sales dependent milestone payments in addition to tiered royalties starting in the mid teens and escalating to the mid twenties based on net sales of brentuximab vedotin within millennium s licensed territories  subject to offsets for royalties paid by millennium to third parties 
we and millennium are each funding percent of the joint development costs under the collaboration 
in japan  millennium is solely responsible for development costs 
the upfront fee and other payments received are deferred and recognized as revenue over the development term of the collaboration agreement  currently estimated at eight years  using a time based approach 
adc collaboration agreements we have entered into collaborations for our adc technology with a number of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  including bayer  celldex  daiichi sankyo  genentech  gsk  millennium  pfizer and progenics 
we receive upfront cash payments  progress dependent milestones  annual maintenance fees and support fees for research and development services and material provided under the agreements 
we are also entitled to receive royalties on net sales of products incorporating our adc technology 
payments received are deferred and recognized as revenue over the development term of the related collaboration agreement using a time based approach 
our collaboration partners are responsible for research  product development  manufacturing and commercialization of all products under the agreements 
collaboration and co development agreement with agensys in january  we entered into an agreement with agensys to jointly research  develop and commercialize adcs for cancer 
the agreement was expanded and modified in november in connection with the expanded agreement  agensys paid us an upfront payment of million 
agensys will conduct preclinical studies aimed at identifying adc product candidates for multiple designated antigens 
we are currently co developing asg me  and we have the right to exercise a co development option for two additional adc product candidates upon submission of an ind 
agensys has the right to develop and commercialize the other adc product candidates on its own  subject to paying us fees  milestones  royalties and support fees for research and development services and material provided under the agreement 
either party may opt out of co development and profit sharing in return for receiving milestones and royalties from the continuing party 
amounts received for product candidates being developed solely by agensys will be recognized as revenue over the development term of the modified collaboration agreement using a time based approach 
revenue from other collaborators primarily included adc collaboration agreements that generated lower amounts of revenue during the periods presented 

table of contents research and development research and development expenses increased to million in from  and increased to million in from our research and development expenses are summarized as follows research and development in thousands annual percentage change research development and contract manufacturing clinical share based compensation expense total research expenses include  among other things  personnel  occupancy and laboratory expenses and technology access fees associated with the discovery and identification of new monoclonal antibodies and related technologies and the development of novel classes of stable linkers and potent cell killing drugs for our adc technology 
research expenses also include research activities associated with our product candidates  such as preclinical translational biology and in vitro and in vivo studies 
research expenses increased during from due primarily to technology access fees 
research expenses decreased during from resulting from the reallocation of staffing to our development groups and reduced lab supplies costs as we focused more of our resources on product development  manufacturing and clinical activities 
development and contract manufacturing expenses include personnel and occupancy expenses and external contract manufacturing costs for the scale up and manufacturing of drug product for use in our clinical trials as well as conformance lot and chemistry  manufacturing and controls  or cmc  activities in support of our recent bla submission to the fda for brentuximab vedotin 
development and contract manufacturing expenses also include quality control and assurance activities  and storage and shipment services of our product candidates 
development and contract manufacturing costs increased to million in from  and to million in from these increases were primarily driven by increased manufacturing activities  including increased brentuximab vedotin and lintuzumab manufacturing activities in  and increased brentuximab vedotin manufacturing activities in development and contract manufacturing expenses also increased in both periods as a result of higher compensation costs related to an increase in staffing levels 
clinical expenses include personnel expenses  travel  occupancy costs and external clinical trial costs including clinical site expenses  clinical research organization charges  contractors and regulatory activities associated with conducting human clinical trials  including ind enabling pharmacology and toxicology studies 
clinical costs increased to million in from  and increased to million in from as we expanded the scope of clinical activities for the brentuximab vedotin program 
clinical trial expenses for dacetuzumab and lintuzumab decreased during as trials were completed 
in addition  compensation costs increased in both and as a result of increased staffing levels 
share based compensation expense reflects the non cash charge associated with stock options and the employee stock purchase plan 
the fair value of all employee share based payments is charged to expense over the vesting period of the related share based payment 
share based compensation expense increased to million in from and to million in from the increase for was primarily due to a higher average value per optioned share primarily attributable to increases in our stock price 
the increase for was due to a larger number of optioned shares subject to expense recognition as a result of increased staffing levels 
certain amounts reported in comparable prior periods in the table above have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation as it relates to the categorization of certain expenses 

table of contents we utilize our employee and infrastructure resources across multiple development projects as well as our discovery and research programs directed towards identifying monoclonal antibodies and new classes of stable linkers and cell killing drugs for our adc program 
we track human resource efforts expended on many of our programs for purposes of billing our collaborators for time incurred at agreed upon rates and for resource planning 
we do not account for actual costs on a project by project basis as it relates to our infrastructure  facility  employee and other indirect costs 
we do  however  separately track significant third party costs including clinical trial costs  manufacturing costs and other contracted service costs on a project by project basis 
the following table shows expenses incurred for research  contract manufacturing of our product candidates and clinical and regulatory services provided by third parties as well as milestone payments for in licensed technology for each of our product candidates

increased clinical trials costs reflect our pivotal trial in patients with relapsed or refractory hodgkin lymphoma that was initiated in early  our phase ii clinical trial in patients with relapsed or refractory salcl  the phase iii aethera clinical trial for post transplant hodgkin lymphoma patients as well as several other clinical trials 
increased manufacturing costs include the costs of resupply of drug product for clinical trials and manufacturing activities in support of the recent bla submission to the fda for brentuximab vedotin 
third party costs for brentuximab vedotin increased in from  primarily due to increased clinical trials and manufacturing costs 
increased clinical trials costs in related to our pivotal trial in patients with relapsed or refractory hodgkin lymphoma and our phase ii clinical trial in patients with relapsed or refractory salcl  together with phase i clinical trials 
increased manufacturing costs include the costs of resupply of drug product for clinical trials and manufacturing activities in support of the recent bla submission to the fda for brentuximab vedotin 
third party costs for lintuzumab increased by in from this increase was due to higher manufacturing costs offset by decreased clinical trial costs related to the phase iib trial evaluating the combination of lintuzumab with low dose cytarabine in patients with aml  which was completed in our third party costs for lintuzumab decreased by in from this decrease was due to decreased clinical trial costs  primarily related to the ongoing phase iib trial evaluating the combination of lintuzumab with low dose cytarabine in patients with aml  which completed patient enrollment in early third party costs for sgn increased by in compared to as a result of the phase i clinical trial that was initiated in late and additional manufacturing costs incurred to support the clinical trial

the collaboration ended in third party costs for asg me decreased by in from primarily as a result of costs incurred in preparation for two phase i clinical trials  which began enrolling patients in third party costs increased by in from primarily as a result of manufacturing activities to support trials initiated in our third party costs for sgn decreased in and in the decrease in reflects lower clinical trial costs as we have completed our phase i clinical trial 
the decrease in reflected lower pharmacology toxicology and clinical trials costs 
other costs and overhead included costs associated with personnel and facilities 
these costs increased by in and in  primarily reflecting an increase in staffing levels in our development and clinical groups from the comparable prior year periods 
our expenditures on current and future preclinical and clinical development programs are subject to numerous uncertainties in timing and cost to completion 
in order to advance our product candidates toward commercialization  the product candidates are tested in numerous preclinical safety  toxicology and efficacy studies 
we then conduct clinical trials for those product candidates that take several years or more to complete 
the length of time varies substantially based upon the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of a product candidate 
the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of a variety of factors  including the number of patients required in our clinical trials  the length of time required to enroll trial participants  the number and location of sites included in the trials  the costs of producing supplies of the product candidates needed for clinical trials and regulatory submissions  the safety and efficacy profile of the product candidate  the use of clinical research organizations to assist with the management of the trials  and the costs and timing of  and the ability to secure  regulatory approvals 
furthermore  our strategy has included entering into collaborations with third parties to participate in the development and commercialization of some of our product candidates 
in these situations  the preclinical development or clinical trial process for a product candidate and the estimated completion date may largely be under the control of that third party and not under our control 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which of our product candidates will be subject to future collaborations or how such arrangements would affect our development plans or capital requirements 
we anticipate that our total research and development expenses will increase in the foreseeable future as we continue to seek regulatory approval for and prepare for the potential commercialization of brentuximab vedotin  as well as continue our preclinical and clinical activities for our other product candidates 
in particular  we expect 
table of contents that development costs for brentuximab vedotin  sgn  asg me and sgn a will increase in compared to we expect our development costs for dacetuzumab and lintuzumab to decrease in compared to the lintuzumab program has been discontinued and we are considering potential next steps for the dacetuzumab program while we evaluate available clinical and preclinical data 
expenses will fluctuate based upon many factors including the degree of collaborative activities  timing of manufacturing campaigns  numbers of patients enrolled in our clinical trials and the outcome of each clinical trial event 
the risks and uncertainties associated with our research and development projects are discussed more fully in item a risk factors 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  we are unable to determine with any degree of certainty the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects  anticipated completion dates or when and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of a product candidate

table of contents liquidity and capital resources december  selected cash flow and balance sheet data in thousands cash  cash equivalents and short term and long term investments working capital stockholders equity years ended december  cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities we have financed the majority of our operations through the issuance of equity securities and by amounts received pursuant to our dacetuzumab collaboration agreement with genentech  our brentuximab vedotin collaboration with millennium and our adc collaborations 
to a lesser degree  we have also financed our operations through interest earned on cash  cash equivalents and investment securities 
these financing sources have historically allowed us to maintain adequate levels of cash and investments 
our combined cash  cash equivalents and investment securities increased to million at december   compared to million at december   and million at december  these increases reflect proceeds from the sale of common stock totaling million in  million in  and million in during  we generated million from operating activities reflecting a million upfront payment and development cost reimbursement payments received under our brentuximab vedotin collaboration with millennium and more than million in upfront and licensing payments under our adc collaborations 
we used million to fund our operating activities in and used million in our working capital was million at december   compared to million at december  and million at december  we have structured our investment portfolio to provide working capital as needed 
our cash  cash equivalents and investments are held in a variety of interest bearing instruments and subject to investment guidelines allowing for holdings in us government and agency securities  corporate bonds  taxable municipal bonds  auction rate securities  commercial paper and money market accounts 
as of december   we held auction rate securities valued at million that have failed at auction and are currently illiquid 
liquidity of these investments is subject to a successful auction process  redemption of the investment  a sale of the security in a secondary market or a negotiated or adjudicated resolution 
each of the securities continues to pay interest according to the stated terms on a monthly basis 
the interest rate on these auction rate securities is no longer established based on an auction process but is established according to the terms of the issue 
as of december   the interest rate of each of the auction rate securities was set at the day london interbank offering rate plus basis points 
we consider the market for these securities to be inactive and distressed 
accordingly  fair value for the auction rate securities has been determined based on a probability weighted discounted cash flow analysis 
this analysis relies upon certain estimates  including the probability weighted term to an orderly liquidation and the discount rate applied to future cash flows 
the discount rate used to determine fair value is based on the observed comparable yield of securities with similar characteristics  adjusted for illiquidity  credit risk and other factors 
due to the expected time to a liquidation event  investments in auction rate securities are presented as long term investments in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets 
we believe it is more likely than not that we have the ability to hold  and intend to hold  these investments until they recover substantially all of their cost basis 
this belief is based on our current assessment of our available cash  expected operating cash requirements  future operating plans and assessment of the individual 
table of contents securities and general market conditions 
we periodically assess this conclusion based on several factors  including the continued failure of future auctions  failure of the investment to be redeemed  further deterioration of the credit rating of the investment  market risk and other factors 
any such future reassessment that results in a conclusion that the unrealized losses on these investments are other than temporary would result in a write down in the fair value of these investments 
such a write down would be recognized in our operating results 
our investment portfolio is structured to provide for investment maturities and access to cash to fund our anticipated working capital needs 
however  if our liquidity needs should be accelerated for any reason in the near term  or investments do not pay at maturity  we may be required to sell investment securities in our portfolio prior to their scheduled maturities  which may result in a loss 
as of december   our cash  cash equivalents and investment securities are presented net of a cumulative million unrealized loss 
this amount represents the difference between our amortized cost and the fair market value of the investments and is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
as of december   we had million held in cash reserves or debt securities scheduled to mature within the next twelve months 
included in net cash used in investing activities in are capital expenditures related to the purchase of laboratory equipment in support of our research and development activities and for leasehold improvements 
we expect that our capital expenditures will increase compared to as we expand our facilities to accommodate our growth 
at our currently planned spending rate  we believe that our financial resources  including the million in net proceeds received from our recently completed public offering of our common stock  together with the fees  milestone payments and reimbursements we expect to earn under our existing collaboration and license agreements  will be sufficient to fund our operations into at least this forecast does not take into account any revenues from potential sales of brentuximab vedotin  which we expect may extend the sufficiency of our financial resources 
although we recently submitted a bla to the fda seeking marketing approval of brentuximab vedotin  we cannot predict with certainty when  or whether  such approval will be received or the timing or success of its potential commercialization 
in addition  changes in our spending rate may occur that would consume available capital resources sooner  such as increased manufacturing and clinical trial expenses and the expansion of our sales and marketing organization preceding the potential commercialization of brentuximab vedotin 
additionally  we may not receive the payments that we currently expect under our existing collaboration and license agreements  including the brentuximab vedotin collaboration agreement with millennium  which may shorten the timeframe through which we are able to fund operations 
for example  in the event of a termination of the brentuximab vedotin collaboration agreement with millennium  we would not receive development cost sharing payments  nor would we receive milestone payments or royalties for the development or sale of brentuximab vedotin 
we expect to make additional capital outlays and to increase operating expenditures over the next several years as we hire additional employees and support our preclinical development  manufacturing and clinical trial activities  as well as position our product candidates  specifically brentuximab vedotin  for potential regulatory approval and commercial sale  and we may therefore need to raise significant amounts of additional capital 
we may seek additional funding through some or all of the following methods corporate collaborations  licensing arrangements and public or private debt or equity financings 
we do not know whether additional capital will be available when needed  or that  if available  we will obtain financing on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
if we are unable to raise additional funds when we need them  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more of our development programs  which may adversely affect our business and operations 
we anticipate that our revenues from collaboration and license agreements will be in the range of million to million in and will be generated from fees  milestones and reimbursements earned through our brentuximab vedotin and adc collaborations 
total operating expenses are expected to be in the range of million to million 
operating expenses will be primarily directed towards brentuximab vedotin development and commercialization activities  as well as development and clinical activities for sgn  
table of contents asg me and sgn a 
development expenses incurred by us under the brentuximab vedotin collaboration with millennium are recognized as expense as incurred 
millennium will co fund of the joint development costs incurred under the collaboration 
expenses will fluctuate based upon many factors including the degree of collaborative activities  the timing of potential fda approval of our recently submitted bla for brentuximab vedotin and the timing of its potential commercialization  the timing of manufacturing campaigns  the number of patients enrolled in our clinical trials and the outcome of each clinical trial 
included in our operating expense estimate are non cash amounts expected to be in the range of million to million  primarily attributable to share based compensation expense 
this estimate is based on a number of assumptions  including future stock prices and the number and timing of option grants 
we expect that net cash used to fund our operating activities in will be million to million and that we will end with more than million in cash  cash equivalents and long and short term investments 
certain external factors may influence our cash spending  including the cost of filing and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments and the progress of our collaborators 
commitments some of our manufacturing  license and collaboration agreements provide for periodic maintenance fees over specified time periods  as well as payments by us upon the achievement of development and regulatory milestones and the payment of royalties based on commercial product sales 
we do not expect to pay royalties on net sales of products under these agreements unless and until we have a product approved for commercial sale 
the amounts set forth below for any given year could be substantially higher if we make certain development progress that requires us to make milestone payments or if we receive regulatory approvals or achieve commercial sales and are required to pay royalties 
the following are our future minimum contractual commitments for the periods subsequent to december  in thousands total thereafter operating leases manufacturing  license and other agreements total operating lease obligations do not assume the exercise by us of any termination or extension options 
approximately of the minimum payments under manufacturing  license and collaboration agreements represent contractual obligations related to performing good manufacturing practices  or gmp  manufacturing for our product candidates 
the above table excludes royalties and up to approximately million in potential future milestone payments to third parties under license and collaboration agreements for our current development programs  which generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental  clinical  regulatory and or commercial milestones 
milestone payments under these agreements have totaled million through december  the above table also excludes contingent purchase commitments under manufacturing agreements to which we may become obligated upon commercialization of brentuximab vedotin  if approved for commercial sale 
because the achievement of future milestones and product commercialization is neither certain nor reasonably estimable with respect to timing  such contingent payments have not been included in the above table and will not be included until the event triggering such payment has occurred 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb completed an accounting standards update entitled milestone method of revenue recognition 
this standard allows the milestone method to be used in the application of the proportional performance model when applied to revenue arrangements 
under this pronouncement an accounting policy election can be made to recognize a payment that is contingent upon the achievement of a substantive milestone in its entirety in the period in which the milestone is achieved 
this standard is effective for us beginning january   and may be applied either prospectively to milestones achieved after the adoption date or retrospectively for all periods presented 
we do not believe that this standard will have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued an accounting standards update entitled multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force 
this standard prescribes the accounting treatment for arrangements that contain multiple deliverable elements and may enable us to account for products or services deliverables separately rather than as a single unit in certain circumstances 
prior to this standard  only certain types of evidence were acceptable for determining the relative selling price of the deliverables under an arrangement 
if that evidence was not available  the deliverables were treated as a single unit of accounting 
this updated standard expands the nature of evidence which may be used to determine the relative selling price of separate deliverables to include estimation 
this standard is applicable to our arrangements entered into or materially modified after december  we do not believe that this standard will have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not have any derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we invest in high quality interest bearing instruments consisting of us government and agency securities  corporate bonds  taxable municipal bonds  auction rate securities  commercial paper and money market accounts 
our investment securities consisted of the following in thousands december  short term investments long term investments other non current assets total long term investments at december  consisted of auction rate securities valued at million that have failed at auction and are currently illiquid 
liquidity of these investments is subject to a successful auction process  redemption of the investment  a sale of the security in a secondary market or a negotiated or adjudicated resolution 
no assurance can be made that further downgrades  losses or other significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash equivalents  short term or long term investments will not occur 
if any such further downgrades  losses  or other significant deteriorations occur  it may negatively impact or impair our current portfolio of cash equivalents  short term and long term investments 
we have estimated the effect on our investment portfolio of a hypothetical increase in interest rates by one percent to be a reduction of million in the fair value of our investments as of december  in addition  a hypothetical decrease of in the effective yield of our investments would reduce our expected investment income by approximately  over the next twelve months based on our investment balance at december  
table of contents foreign currency risk all of our revenues and the majority of our expenses are denominated in us dollars and as a result  we have not experienced significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses to date 
we have conducted some transactions in foreign currencies during the fiscal year ended december   primarily related to contract manufacturing and ex us clinical trial activities  and we expect to continue to do so 
our primary exposure is to fluctuations in the euro and british pound 
we do not anticipate that foreign currency transaction gains or losses will be significant at our current level of operations 
however  transaction gains or losses may become significant in the future as we continue to expand our operations internationally 
we have not engaged in foreign currency hedging to date 
however  we may do so in the future
