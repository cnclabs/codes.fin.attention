item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the section titled environmental matters 
competition the businesses of gswc and ccwc are substantially free from direct and indirect competition with other public utilities  municipalities and other public agencies within their existing service territories 
gswc and ccwc compete with governmental agencies and other investor owned utilities in connection with offering service to new real estate developments on the basis of financial terms  availability of water and ability to commence providing service on a timely basis 
awr s other subsidiary  asus  actively competes for business with other investor owned utilities  other third party providers of water and or wastewater services  and governmental entities primarily on the basis of price and quality of service 
employee relations awr had a total of employees as of december  as compared to employees as of december  gswc had employees as of december  as compared to employees as of december  nineteen positions in gswc s bear valley electric customer service area are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with the international brotherhood of electrical workers  which expired in gswc is currently in negotiations with this union on a new agreement 
sixty five employees in gswc s region ii ratemaking district are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with the utility workers union of america  which expires in gswc has no other unionized employees

table of contents forward looking information this form k and the documents incorporated by reference herein contain forward looking statements intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements include statements regarding our goals  beliefs  plans or current expectations  taking into account the information currently available to management 
forward looking statements are not statements of historical facts 
for example  when we use words such as believes  anticipates  expects  plans  estimates  intends  may and other words that convey uncertainty of future events or outcomes  we are making forward looking statements 
such statements address future events and conditions concerning such matters as our ability to raise capital  capital expenditures  earnings  litigation  rates  water sales  water quality and other regulatory matters  adequacy of water supplies  our ability to recover electric  natural gas and water supply costs from customers  contract operations  liquidity and capital resources  and accounting matters 
we caution you that any forward looking statements made by us are not guarantees of future performance and that actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated in such statements  by reason of factors such as changes in utility regulation  recovery of regulatory assets not yet included in rates  future economic conditions which affect changes in customer demand and changes in water and energy supply costs  changes in pension and post retirement benefit plan costs  future climatic conditions  delays in customer payments or price redeterminations or equitable adjustments on contracts executed by asus and its subsidiaries  potential assessments for failure to meet interim targets for the purchase of renewable energy  and legislative  legal proceedings  regulatory and other circumstances affecting anticipated revenues and costs 

table of contents item a risk factors you should carefully read the risks described below and other information in this form k in order to understand certain of the risks of our business 
our business is heavily regulated and  as a result  decisions by regulatory agencies and changes in laws and regulations can significantly affect our business our revenues depend substantially on the rates and fees we charge our customers and the ability to recover our costs on a timely basis  including the ability to recover the costs of purchased water  groundwater assessments  electric power  natural gas  chemicals  water treatment  security at water facilities and preventative maintenance and emergency repairs 
any delays by either the cpuc or the acc in granting rate relief to cover increased operating and capital costs at our public utilities or delays in obtaining approval of our requests for equitable adjustments or price redeterminations for contracted services from the us government may adversely affect our financial performance 
we may file for interim rates in california in situations where there may be delays in granting final rate relief during a general rate case proceeding 
if the cpuc approves lower rates  the cpuc will require us to refund to customers the difference between the interim rates and the rates approved by the cpuc 
similarly  if the cpuc approves rates that are higher than the interim rates  the cpuc may authorize us to recover the difference between the interim rates and the final rates 
regulatory decisions may also impact prospective revenues and earnings  affect the timing of the recognition of revenues and expenses  may overturn past decisions used in determining our revenues and expenses and could result in impairment of goodwill if the decision affects a subsidiary 
management continually evaluates the anticipated recovery of regulatory assets  liabilities and revenues subject to refund and provides for allowances and or reserves as deemed necessary 
in the event that our assessment of the probability of recovery through the ratemaking process is incorrect  we will adjust the associated regulatory asset or liability to reflect the change in our assessment or any regulatory disallowances 
a change in our evaluation of the probability of recovery of regulatory assets  a regulatory disallowance of all or a portion of our costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
management also reviews goodwill for impairment at least annually 
asus has million of goodwill which may be at risk for potential impairment if requested price redeterminations and or equitable adjustments are not granted 
ccwc has million of goodwill which we do not believe is at risk for potential impairment 
we are also  in some cases  required to estimate future expenses and in others  we are required to incur the expense before recovering costs 
as a result  our revenues and earnings may fluctuate depending on the accuracy of our estimates  the timing of our investments or expenses or other factors 
if expenses increase significantly over a short period of time  we may experience delays in recovery of these expenses  the inability to recover carrying costs for these expenses and increased risks of regulatory disallowances or write offs 
regulatory agencies may also change their rules and policies which may adversely affect our profitability and cash flows 
changes in policies of the us government may also adversely affect our military base contract operations 
in certain circumstances  the us government may be unwilling or unable to appropriate funds to pay costs mandated by changes in rules and policies of state regulatory agencies 
the us government may disagree with the increases that we request and may delay approval of requests for equitable adjustment or redetermination of prices which could adversely affect our anticipated rates of return 
we may also be subject to fines or penalties if a regulatory agency determines that we have failed to comply with laws  regulations or orders applicable to our businesses  unless we appeal this determination  or our appeal of an adverse determination is denied 
our costs involved in maintaining water quality and complying with environmental regulation have increased and are expected to continue to increase our capital and operating costs have increased substantially as a result of increases in environmental regulation arising from increases in the cost of disposing of residuals from our water treatment plants  upgrading and building new water treatment plants  monitoring compliance activities and securing alternative supplies when necessary 
our public utilities may be able to recover these costs through the ratemaking process 
we may also be able to recover these costs under contractual arrangements 
in certain circumstances  costs may be recoverable from parties responsible or potentially responsible for contamination  either voluntarily or through specific court action 

table of contents we may also incur significant costs in connection with seeking to recover costs due to contamination of water supplies 
our ability to recover these types of costs also depends upon a variety of factors  including approval of rate increases  the willingness of potentially responsible parties to settle litigation and otherwise address the contamination and the extent and magnitude of the contamination 
we can give no assurance regarding the adequacy of any such recovery to offset the costs associated with the contamination or the cost of recovery of these costs 
we may sustain losses that exceed or are excluded from our insurance coverage or for which we are not insured we are  from time to time  parties to legal or regulatory proceedings 
these proceedings may pertain to regulatory investigations  employment matters or other disputes 
management periodically reviews its assessment of the probable outcome of these proceedings  the costs and expenses reasonably expected to be incurred  and the availability and extent of insurance coverage 
on the basis of this review  management establishes reserves for such matters 
we may  however  from time to time be required to pay fines  penalties or damages that exceed our insurance coverage and or reserves if our estimate of the probable outcome of such proceedings proves to be inaccurate 
we maintain insurance coverage as part of our overall legal and risk management strategy to minimize our potential liabilities 
however  our insurance policies contain exclusions and other limitations that may not cover our potential liabilities 
generally  our insurance policies cover worker s compensation  employer s liability  general liability and automobile liability 
each policy includes deductibles or self insured retentions and policy limits for covered claims 
as a result  we may sustain losses that exceed or that are excluded from our insurance coverage or for which we are not insured 
additional risks associated with our public utility operations our operating costs have increased and are expected to continue to increase as a result of groundwater contamination our operations are impacted by groundwater contamination in certain service territories 
we have taken a number of steps to address contamination  including the removal of wells from service  decreasing the amount of groundwater pumped from wells in order to slow the movement of plumes of contaminated water  constructing water treatment facilities and securing alternative sources of supply from other areas not affected by the contamination 
in emergency situations  we have supplied our customers with bottled water until the emergency situation has been resolved 
in some cases  potentially responsible parties have reimbursed us for some or all of our costs 
in other cases  we have taken legal action against parties believed to be potentially responsible for the contamination 
to date  the cpuc has permitted us to establish memorandum accounts in california for potential recovery of these types of costs 
we can give no assurance regarding the outcome of litigation arising out of contamination or our ability to recover these costs in the future 
persons who are potentially responsible for causing the contamination of groundwater supplies have asserted claims against water distributors on a variety of theories and have thus far brought the water distributors including gswc within the class of potentially responsible parties in federal court actions pending in los angeles county 
this increases the costs and risks of seeking recovery of these costs 
management believes that rate recovery  proper insurance coverage and reserves are in place to appropriately manage these types of claims 
however  such claims  if ultimately resolved unfavorably to us  could  in the aggregate  have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
the adequacy of our water supplies depends upon a variety of uncontrollable factors the adequacy of our water supplies varies from year to year depending upon a variety of factors  including rainfall  runoff  flood control and availability of reservoir storage  availability of colorado river water and imported water from northern california  the amount of useable water stored in reservoirs and groundwater basins  the amount of water used by our customers and others  water quality  legal limitations on production  diversion  storage  conveyance and use  and climate change 

table of contents population growth and increases in the amount of water used in california and arizona have caused increased stress on surface water supplies and groundwater basins 
in addition  new court ordered pumping restrictions on water obtained from the sacramento san joaquin delta may decrease the amount of water metropolitan water district of southern california mwd  is able to import from northern california 
we are providing incentives to and or assessing penalties on our customers in order to encourage water conservation 
we are also acting to secure additional supplies from desalination and water transfers 
however  we cannot predict to what extent these efforts to reduce stress on our water supplies will be successful or sustainable 
ccwc obtains its water supply from operating wells and from the colorado river through the central arizona project cap 
ccwc s water supply may be subject to interruption or reduction if there is an interruption or reduction in water supplies available to cap 
in addition  ccwc s ability to provide water service to new real estate developments is dependent upon ccwc s ability to meet the requirements of the arizona department of water resources regarding the ccwc s assured water supply account 
water shortages at our rate regulated water utilities may adversely affect our supply mix  for instance  causing increased reliance upon more expensive water sources  adversely affect our operating costs  for instance  by increasing the cost of producing water from more highly contaminated aquifers  result in an increase in our capital expenditures  for example by requiring the construction of pipelines to connect to alternative sources of supply  new wells to replace those that are no longer in service or are otherwise inadequate to meet the needs of our customers  and reservoirs and other facilities to conserve or reclaim water  and adversely affect the volume of water sold as a result of mandatory or voluntary conservation efforts by customers 
we may be able to recover increased operating and capital costs through the ratemaking process 
gswc has implemented a modified supply cost balancing account to track and recover costs from supply mix changes and rate changes by wholesale suppliers  as authorized by the cpuc 
we may also recover costs from certain third parties that may be responsible  or potentially responsible  for groundwater contamination 
our liquidity may be adversely affected by changes in water supply costs we obtain our water supplies for gswc and ccwc from a variety of sources 
for example  water is pumped from aquifers within our service areas to meet a portion of the demands of our customers 
when water produced from wells in those areas is insufficient to meet customer demand or when such production is interrupted  we have purchased water from other suppliers 
as a result  our cost of providing  distributing and treating water for our customers use can vary significantly 
furthermore  imported water wholesalers  such as mwd and cap may not always have an adequate supply of water to sell to us 
our liquidity and earnings may be adversely affected by increases in maintenance costs due to our aging infrastructure some of our systems in california are more than years old 
we have experienced leaks and water quality and mechanical problems in some of these older systems 
in addition  well and pump maintenance expenses are affected by labor and material costs and more stringent water discharge requirements 
these costs can increase unexpectedly in substantial amounts 
we include increases in maintenance costs in each general rate case filed by our rate regulated public utilities for possible recovery 
however  we estimate the amount of expenses expected to be incurred during future years in california 
we may not recover overages from those estimates in rates 

table of contents our liquidity and earnings may be adversely affected by our conservation efforts conservation by all customer classes at gswc and ccwc is a top priority 
however  customer conservation can result in lower volumes of water sold 
we are also experiencing a decline in per residential customer water usage due to the use of more efficient household fixtures and appliances by residential consumers  and perhaps  efforts by our customers to reduce costs as a result of adverse economic conditions 
our public utilities businesses are heavily dependent upon revenue generated from rates charged to our residential customers for the volume of water used 
the rates we charge for water are regulated by the cpuc and the acc and may not be unilaterally adjusted to reflect changes in demand 
declining usage also negatively impacts our long term operating revenues if we are unable to secure rate increases or if growth in the residential customer base does not occur to the extent necessary to offset the per customer residential usage decline 
we implemented a water revenue adjustment mechanism wram at gswc which has the effect of reducing the adverse impacts of our customers conservation efforts on revenues  however  cash flows from operations can be significantly affected as much of the revenues recognized in the wram account s will be collected from customers primarily through a surcharge over a month period 
our earnings may be affected  to some extent  by weather during different seasons the demand for water and electricity varies by season 
for instance  most water consumption occurs during the third quarter of each year when weather in california and arizona tends to be hot and dry 
during unusually wet weather  our customers generally use less water 
gswc implemented a conservation rate design and a water revenue adjustment mechanism  for regions ii and iii in late november  and for region i s ratemaking areas in september  which should help mitigate fluctuations in revenues and earnings due to changes in water consumption in california 
ccwc s revenues and profitability will  however  continue to be impacted by changes in water consumption in arizona 
the demand for electricity in our electric customer service area is greatly affected by winter snows 
an increase in winter snows reduces the use of snowmaking machines at ski resorts in the big bear area and  as a result  reduces our electric revenues 
likewise  unseasonably warm weather during a skiing season may result in temperatures too high for snowmaking conditions  which also reduces our electric revenues 
in november  gswc implemented a base revenue requirement adjustment mechanism for our electric business which should help mitigate fluctuations in the revenues and earnings of our electric business due to changes in the amount of electricity used by gswc s customers 
our liquidity  and in certain circumstances  earnings  may be adversely affected by increases in electricity and natural gas prices in california we purchase most of our electric energy sold to customers in our electric customer service area from others under purchased power contracts 
in addition to purchased power contracts  we purchase additional energy from the spot market to meet peak demand 
we may sell surplus power to the spot market during times of reduced energy demand 
we also operate a natural gas fueled megawatt generator in our electric service area 
the cpuc permits us to recover energy purchase costs from customers  up to an annual weighted average cost of per megawatt hour mwh each year 
upon expiration of the mwh rate in august  the cpuc will grant approval for revised rates to recover these energy costs 
we are required to write off costs in excess of this cap 
as a result  we are at risk for increases in spot market prices of electricity purchased and for decreases in spot market prices for electricity sold 
unexpected generator downtime or a failure to perform by any of the counterparties to our electric and natural gas purchase contracts could further increase our exposure to fluctuating natural gas and electric prices 
changes in electricity prices also affect the unrealized gains and losses on our block forward purchased power contracts that qualify as derivative instruments as we adjust the asset or liability on these contracts to reflect the fair market value of the contracts at the end of each month 
the cpuc has authorized us to establish a memorandum account to track the changes in the fair market value of our power purchased contracts that became effective on january  as a result  unrealized gains and losses on these purchased power contracts will not impact earnings 

table of contents we may not be able to procure sufficient renewable energy resources to comply with cpuc rules we are required to procure a portion of our electricity from renewable energy resources 
due to our small size as compared to other energy utilities and the constrained renewable energy market  we have not been able to obtain sufficient resources to achieve the established interim target purchase levels 
we believe that bves is permitted to defer compliance with these requirements under the cpuc s flexible compliance rules 
however  bves may be subject to fines and penalties by the cpuc if the cpuc determines that bves is not in compliance with the renewable resource procurement rules 
our assets are subject to condemnation municipalities and other government subdivisions may  in certain circumstances  seek to acquire certain of our assets through eminent domain proceedings 
it is generally our practice to contest these proceedings which may be costly and may divert the attention of management from the operation of our business 
if a municipality or other government subdivision succeeds in acquiring our assets  there is a risk that we will not receive adequate compensation for the assets acquired or be able to recover all charges associated with the divestiture of these assets 
additional risks associated with our contracted services we derive revenues from contract operations primarily from the operation and maintenance of water and or wastewater systems at military bases and the construction of water and wastewater improvements to the infrastructure on most of these bases 
as a result  these operations are subject to risks that are different than those of our public utility operations 
our operations and maintenance contracts on military bases create certain risks that are different from our public utility operations we have entered into contracts to provide water and or wastewater services at military bases pursuant to year contracts  subject to termination  in whole or in part  for the convenience of the us government 
in addition  the us government may stop work under the terms of the contracts  delay performance of our obligations under the contracts or modify the contracts at its convenience 
our contract pricing was based on a number of assumptions  including assumptions about prices and availability of labor  equipment and materials 
we may be unable to recover all costs if any of these assumptions are inaccurate or if all costs that we may incur in connection with performing the work were not considered 
our operations and maintenance contracts are also subject to periodic price adjustments at the time of price redetermination or in connection with requests for equitable adjustments or other changes permitted by the terms of the contracts 
the contract price for each of these contracts is subject to redetermination two years after commencement of operations and every three years thereafter to the extent provided in each of the contracts 
prices are also subject to equitable adjustment based upon changes in circumstances and changes in wages and fringe benefits to the extent provi ded in each of the contracts 
we have experienced delays in the redetermination of prices following completion of the first two years of operation under our operation and maintenance contracts 
we have also experienced delays in the past in obtaining a final equitable adjustment of prices for the significantly higher infrastructure at certain of the bases than that described by the us government in its request for proposal 
these delays have negatively impacted our results of operations and cash flows 
we are required to record all costs incurred under these types of contracts as these costs are incurred 
as a result  we may record losses associated with unanticipated conditions  higher than anticipated infrastructure levels and emergency work at the time such expenses occur 
we recognize revenue for such work as  and to the extent that  our requests for equitable adjustments are approved 
delays in obtaining approval of equitable adjustments can negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows 
we are subject to audits  cost review and investigations by contracting oversight agencies 
during the course of an audit  the oversight agency may disallow costs 
such cost disallowances may result in adjustments to previously reported revenues 
payment under these contracts is subject to appropriations by congress 
we may experience delays in receiving payment or delays in redetermination of prices or other price adjustments due to cancelled or delayed appropriations specific to our projects or reductions in government spending for the military generally or military base operations specifically 

table of contents appropriations and the timing of payment may be influenced by  among other things  the state of the economy  competing political priorities  budget constraints  the timing and amount of tax receipts and the overall level of government expenditures for the military generally or military base operations specifically 
risks associated with the collection of wastewater are different  in some respects  from that of our water utility operations the wastewater collection system operations of our subsidiaries providing wastewater services on military bases are subject to substantial regulation and involve significant environmental risks 
if collection or sewage systems fail  overflow or do not operate properly  untreated wastewater or other contaminants could spill onto nearby properties or into nearby streams and rivers  causing damage to persons or property  injury to aquatic life and economic damages  which may not be recoverable 
this risk is most acute during periods of substantial rainfall or flooding  which are common causes of sewer overflows and system failures 
liabilities resulting from such damage could adversely and materially affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in the event that we are deemed liable for any damage caused by overflow  our losses might not be covered by insurance policie s or we may find it difficult to secure insurance for this business in the future at acceptable rates 
our contracts for the construction of infrastructure improvements on military bases create risks that are different  in some respects  from that of our operations and maintenance contracts we have entered into contract modifications with the us government and in some cases third parties for the construction of new water and or wastewater infrastructure at the military bases 
most of these contracts are firm fixed price contracts 
under firm fixed price contracts  we benefit from cost savings and earnings  but are generally unable to recover any cost overruns to the approved contract price 
under extenuating circumstances  the us government has approved increased cost change orders 
we recognize revenues from these types of contracts using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
this accounting practice results in our recognizing contract revenues and earnings ratably over the contract term in proportion to our incurrence of contract costs or the physical completion of the construction projects 
the earnings or losses recognized on individual contracts are based on periodic estimates of contract revenues  costs and profitability as the construction projects progress 
we establish prices for these types of firm fixed price contracts based  in part  on cost estimates that are subject to a number of assumptions  including assumptions regarding future economic conditions 
if these estimates prove inaccurate or circumstances change  cost overruns could have a material adverse effect on our contracted business operations and results of operations 
we may be adversely affected by disputes with the us government regarding our performance of contract services on military bases if there is a dispute with the us government regarding performance under these contracts or the amounts owed to us  the us government may delay  reject or withhold payment  or assert its right to offset damages against amounts owed to us 
if we are unable to collect amounts owed to us on a timely basis or the us government asserts its offset rights  profits and cash flows will be adversely affected 
if we fail to comply with the terms of one or more of our us government contracts  other agreements with the us government or us government regulations and statutes  we could be suspended or barred from future us government contracts for a period of time and be subject to possible damages  fines and penalties and damage to our reputation in the water and wastewater industry 

table of contents we depend  to some extent  upon subcontractors to assist us in the performance of contracted services on military bases we rely  to some extent  on subcontractors to assist us in the operation and maintenance of the water and wastewater systems at military bases 
the failure of any of these subcontractors to perform services for us in accordance with the terms of our contracts with the us government could result in the termination of our contracts to provide water and or wastewater services at these bases  a loss of revenues or increases in costs to correct a subcontractor s performance failures 
we are able to mitigate these risks  in part  by obtaining and requiring our subcontractors to obtain performance bonds 
we are also required to make a good faith effort to achieve our small business subcontracting plan goals pursuant to us government regulation 
if we fail to use good faith efforts to meet these goals  the us government may assess damages against us at the end of the contract or  in some cases  at the end of each price redetermination period 
the us government has the right to offset claimed damages against any amounts owed to us 
we also rely on third party manufacturers as well as third party subcontractors to complete our construction projects 
to the extent that we cannot engage subcontractors or acquire equipment or materials  our ability to complete a project in a timely fashion or at a profit may be impaired 
if the amount of costs we incur for these projects exceeds the amount we have estimated in our bid  we could experience losses in the performance of these contracts 
in addition  if a subcontractor or manufacturer is unable to deliver its services  equipment or materials according to the negotiated terms for any reason  including the deterioration of its financial condition  we may be required to purchase the services  equipment or materials from another source at a higher price 
this may reduce the profit to be realized or result in a loss on a project for which the services  equipment or materials were need ed 
if these subcontractors fail to perform services to be provided to us or fail to provide us with the proper equipment or materials  we may be penalized for their failure to perform  however  our contracts with these subcontractors include certain protective provisions  which may include the assessment of liquidated damages 
we mitigate these risks by requiring many of our subcontractors to obtain performance bonds and to compensate us for any penalties we may be required to pay as a result of their failure to perform 
our earnings may be affected  to some extent  by weather during different seasons seasonal weather conditions  such as hurricanes or significant winter storms  occasionally cause temporary office closures and or result in temporary halts to construction activity at military bases 
to the extent that our construction activities are impeded by these events  we will experience a delay in recognizing revenues from these construction projects 
we continue to incur costs associated with the expansion of our contract activities we continue to incur additional costs in connection with the attempted expansion of our contract operations associated with the preparation of bids for new contracts for contract operations on military bases and compliance with regulatory requirements associated with our water marketing efforts 
our ability to recover these costs and to earn a profit on our contract operations will depend upon the extent to which we are successful in obtaining new contracts on military bases and satisfying regulatory requirements associated with our water marketing efforts and recovering these costs and other costs from new contract revenues 
other risks our business requires significant capital expenditures the utility business is capital intensive 
on an annual basis  we spend significant sums of money for additions to  or replacement of  our property  plant and equipment at our california and arizona utilities 
we obtain funds for these capital projects from operations  contributions by developers and others and advances from developers which are repaid over a period of time at no interest 
we also periodically borrow money or issue equity for these purposes 
in addition  we have a syndicated bank credit facility that is partially used for these purposes 
we cannot provide assurance that these sources will continue to be adequate or that the cost of funds will remain at levels permitting us to earn a reasonable rate of return 
our subsidiaries providing water and wastewater services on military bases also expect to incur significant capital expenditures 
to the extent that the us government does not reimburse us for these expenditures as the work is performed 
table of contents or completed  the us government will repay us over time 
however  if there is a dispute with the us government regarding performance under these contracts or the amounts owed to us  the us government may delay  reject or withhold payment  or assert its right to offset damages against amounts owed to us 
if we are unable to collect amounts owed to us on a timely basis or the us government asserts its offset rights  profits and cash flows will be adversely affected 
we may be adversely impacted by economic conditions economic uncertainty continues to impact the growth of the debt and equity markets 
although portions of our operations are funded through cash flows from operations  we obtain funds through external sources such as bank borrowings as well as issuance of debt and equity securities 
access to these external financing on reasonable terms depends  in part  on conditions in the debt and equity markets 
when business and market conditions deteriorate  we may no longer have access to the capital markets on reasonable terms 
our ability to obtain funds is dependent upon our ability to access the capital markets by issuing debt or equity to third parties or obtaining funds from our revolving credit facility which expires in may in the event of finan cial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets  additional consolidation of the financial services industry  significant financial service institution failures or our inability to renew or replace our existing revolving credit facility on attractive terms  it may become necessary for us to seek funds from other sources on unattractive terms 
our failure to comply with the restrictive covenants in our long term debt agreements and credit facility could trigger prepayment obligations our failure to comply with the restrictive covenants under our long term debt agreements could result in an event of default  which  if not cured or waived  could result in us being required to repay or refinance these borrowings before their due dates on less favorable terms 
if we are forced to repay or refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by increased costs and interest rates 
we are a holding company that depends on cash flow from gswc to meet our financial obligations and to pay dividends on our common shares as a holding company  our subsidiaries conduct substantially all operations and our only significant assets are investments in our subsidiaries 
this means that we are dependent on distributions of funds from our subsidiaries to meet our debt service obligations and to pay dividends on our common shares 
more than of our revenues in were derived from the operations of gswc 
moreover  none of our other subsidiaries has paid any dividends to us during the past three years 
as a result  we are largely dependent on cash flow from gswc to meet our financial obligations and to pay dividends on our common shares 
our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and generally have no obligation to pay any amounts due on our debt 
our subsidiaries only pay dividends if and when declared by the subsidiary board 
moreover  gswc is obligated to give first priority to its own capital requirements and to maintain a capital structure consistent with that determined to be reasonable by the cpuc in its most recent decision on capital structure  in order that customers not be adversely affected by the holding company structure 
furthermore  our right to receive cash or other assets in the unlikely event of liquidation or reorganization of gswc is generally subject to the prior claims of creditors of that subsidiary 
if we are unable to obtain funds from gswc in a timely manner  we may be unable to meet our financial obligations  make additional investments or pay dividends 
we are increasingly dependent on the continuous and reliable operation of our information technology systems we rely on our information technology systems in connection with the operation of our business  especially with respect to customer service and billing  accounting and  in some cases  the monitoring and operation of our treatment  storage and pumping facilities 
a loss of these systems or major problems with the operation of these systems could affect our operations and have a significant material adverse effect on our results of operations 

table of contents our operations are geographically concentrated in california although we operate water and wastewater facilities in a number of states  our operations are concentrated in california  particularly southern california 
as a result  our financial results are largely subject to political  water supply  labor  utility cost and regulatory risks  economic conditions and other economic risks affecting california 
california has been particularly hard hit by the recent economic crisis 
california is  among other things  raising taxes in order to help balance the state budget and jobs may be lost to other states which are perceived as having a more business friendly climate  thereby exacerbating the impact of the financial crisis in california 
we operate in areas subject to natural disasters or that may be the target of terrorist activities we operate in areas that are prone to earthquakes  fires  mudslides and other natural disasters 
while we maintain insurance policies to help reduce our financial exposure  a significant seismic event in southern california  where our operations are concentrated  or other natural disasters in california could adversely impact our ability to deliver water and adversely affect our costs of operations 
the cpuc has historically allowed utilities to establish a catastrophic event memorandum account to recover these costs 
terrorists could seek to disrupt service to our customers by targeting our assets 
we have invested in additional security for facilities throughout our regulated service areas to mitigate the risks of terrorist activities 
we also may be prevented from providing water and or wastewater services at the military bases we serve in times of military crisis affecting these bases

table of contents item legal proceedings water quality related litigation perchlorate and or volatile organic compounds voc have been detected in five wells servicing gswc s south san gabriel system 
gswc filed suit in federal court  along with two other affected water purveyors and the san gabriel basin water quality authority wqa  against some of those allegedly responsible for the contamination of two of these wells 
some of the other potential defendants settled with gswc  other water purveyors and the wqa the water entities  on voc related issues prior to the filing of the lawsuit 
in response to the filing of the lawsuit  the potentially responsible party prp defendants filed motions to dismiss the suit or strike certain portions of the suit 
the judge issued a ruling on april  granting in part and denying in part the prp s motions 
a key ruling of the court was that the water purveyo rs  including gswc  by virtue of their ownership of wells contaminated with hazardous chemicals are themselves prps under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act cercla 
gswc has  pursuant to permission of the court  amended its suit to claim certain affirmative defenses as an innocent party under cercla 
registrant is presently unable to predict the outcome of this ruling on its ability to fully recover from the prps future costs associated with the treatment of these wells 
in this same suit  the prps have filed cross complaints against the water entities  the mwd  the main san gabriel basin watermaster and others on the theory that they arranged for and did transport contaminated water into the main san gabriel basin for use by gswc and the other two affected water purveyors and for other related claims 
on august   the us environmental protection agency epa issued unilateral administrative orders uao against parties deemed responsible for polluting the groundwater in that portion of the san gabriel valley from which the two impacted gswc wells draw water 
gswc was not named as a party to the uao 
the uao requires that these parties remediate the contamination 
the judge in the lawsuit has appointed a special master to oversee mandatory settlement discussions between the prps and the water entities 
epa is also conducting settlement discussions with several prps regarding the uao 
the water entities and epa are working to coordinate their settlement discussions under the special master in order to arrive at a complete resolution of all issues affecting the lawsuit and the uao 
settlements have been reached between wqa and some prps 
settlements with a number of other prps are being finalized  however  registrant is presently unable to predict the ultimate outcome of these settlement discussions

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion and analysis provides information on awr s consolidated operations and assets and where necessary  includes specific references to awr s individual segments and or other subsidiaries gswc  ccwc  asus and its subsidiaries 
included in the following analysis is a discussion of water and electric margins 
water and electric margins are computed by taking total revenues  less total supply costs 
registrant uses these margins and related percentages as an important measure in evaluating its operating results 
registrant believes this measure is a useful internal benchmark in evaluating the performance of gswc and ccwc 
registrant reviews these measurements regularly and compares them to historical periods and to our operating budget as approved 
however  this measure  which is not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting p rinciples gaap  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities and should not be considered as an alternative to operating income  which is determined in accordance with gaap  as an indicator of operating performance 
a reconciliation of water and electric margins to the most directly comparable gaap measures are included in the table under the section titled operating expenses supply costs 
overview registrant s revenues  operating income and cash flows are earned primarily through delivering potable water to homes and businesses through approximately  miles of water distribution pipelines and the delivery of electricity in the big bear area of san bernardino county 
rates charged to customers of gswc and ccwc are determined by the cpuc and acc  respectively 
these rates are intended to allow recovery of operating costs and a reasonable rate of return on capital 
factors affecting financial performance of our regulated utilities include the process and timing of setting rates charged to customers  the ability to recover  and the process for recovering in rates  the costs of distributing water and electricity and our overhead costs  fines  penalties and disallowances by state regulatory agencies arising from failures to comply with regulatory requirements  weather  the impac t of increased water quality standards and environmental regulations on the cost of operations and capital expenditures  pressures on water supply caused by population growth  more stringent water quality standards  deterioration in water quality and water supply from a variety of causes  capital expenditures needed to upgrade water systems and increased costs and risks associated with litigation relating to water quality and water supply  including suits initiated by gswc to protect its water supply 
operating revenues and income from contracted services at asus and its subsidiaries are earned from the operation and maintenance and renewal and replacement of the water and or wastewater systems for the us government at various military bases  as well as from construction of new water and or wastewater facilities at those bases under contract modifications 
all of the current contracts with the us government are year firm  fixed price contracts with prospective price redeterminations 
additional revenues generated by contract operations are primarily dependent on these new construction activities 
as a result  asus is subject to risks that are different than those of registrant s public utility water and electric utilities 
asus plans to continue seeking contracts for the operation and maintenance and renewal and replacement of water and or wastewater services at milit ary bases 
factors affecting the financial performance of our military utility privatization subsidiaries include delays in receiving payments from the us government and the redetermination and equitable adjustment of prices under the contracts with the us government  fines  penalties or disallowance of costs by the federal government  and termination of contracts and suspension or debarment for a period of time from contracting with the federal government due to violations of federal law and regulations in connection with military utility privatization activities 
gswc plans to continue to seek additional rate increases in future years from the cpuc and the us government to recover operating and supply costs and receive reasonable returns on invested capital 
capital expenditures in future years at gswc are expected to remain at much higher levels than depreciation expense 
when necessary  registrant obtains funds from external sources in the capital markets and through bank borrowings 
gswc plans to issue public debt in  depending on market conditions 
proceeds from the debt issuance are expected to be used to pay down short term borrowings from awr which will be used by awr to reduce borrowings under its million revolving credit facility  and retire other long term debt with higher interest rates 
on june   awr entered into a stock purchase agreement with epcor water usa inc epcor to sell all the common shares of ccwc for a total purchase price of million  including the assumption of approximately million of long term debt 
approximately million in cash will be paid to awr at closing 
the purchase price is subject to certain adjustments for changes in retained earnings 
the consummation of the transaction contemplated by the agreement is subject to customary conditions  including among other things  regulatory approval by the acc  which is anticipated to be received in therefore  no gain on disposal of ccwc has been recorded in had the transaction closed as of december   awr would have recognized a pretax gain on disposal of approximately million  net of transaction costs of  the results of operations of ccwc for  and have been presented as a discontinued operation 

table of contents on november   the cpuc issued a final decision on gswc s region ii  region iii and general office rate case 
the cpuc approved revenue increases for of approximately million as compared to adopted revenues  including an increase of million for supply costs 
the rate increases were retroactive to january  the million revenue increase included approximately million already collected in as of the date of the decision through a supply cost offset surcharge in effect since 
effective january   a twenty four month surcharge is in effect to collect the remaining uncollected retroactive portion of the revenue increase  which totals approximately million  and has been recorded as a regulatory asset as of december  the cpuc also authorized gswc to establish a two way balancing account to track differences between the forecasted annual pension expenses adopted in rates for calendar years  and and the actual annual expense to be recorded by gswc s water regions in accordance with the accounting guidance for pension costs 
as a result  gswc recorded million to the pension balancing account in the fourth quarter of  which reduces operating expenses 
had the new rates from the final decision been in place on january   the impact by quarter to diluted earnings per share from continuing operations would be as follows fully diluted eps from impact of adjusted continuing operations retroactive fully diluted impact by quarter as reported rates eps first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter year ended december  during the first quarter of  asus recorded an increase to pretax income of million  or per share  reflecting approval from the us government of requests for equitable adjustment  which were retroactive  for managing more infrastructure than originally estimated by the government in its solicitation of bids for operation of the water and wastewater facilities at fort bragg in north carolina and fort bliss in texas 
adjusted fully diluted eps this measure is not presented in accordance with gaap  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities  and should not be considered as an alternative measurement to eps 
registrant has presented this information as we believe this measure is a useful benchmark in assessing its performance on a quarterly basis had the cpuc decision been in effect as of january  in and increased rates were in effect for the entire fiscal year 
during the third and fourth quarters of  a pretax charge for the impairment of assets and loss contingencies were recorded totaling and per share  respectively 
the sum of the quarterly diluted earnings per share and adjusted fully diluted eps do not agree to the yearly totals due to rounding 
on february   the cpuc issued a subpoena to gswc in connection with an investigation of certain work orders and charges paid to a specific contractor used previously by gswc for numerous construction projects estimated to total million completed over a period of years 
the cpuc s investigation focuses on whether gswc was overcharged for these construction projects and whether these overcharges  if any  were included in customer rates 
should the cpuc investigation result in a disallowance of certain previously capitalized costs  such costs  and potentially any return earned on such costs  may be required to be refunded to customers resulting in a charge to operating income 
in addition to the disallowance of previously capitalized costs and the return earned on such costs  the cpuc also has the authority to assess fines and penalties 
the staff of the cpuc has indicated to gswc that it intends to seek such remedies  including possibly a fine and penalty 
gswc does not believe that a disallowance is required or that a penalty is justified 
gswc intends to vigorously defend the matter  however  proceedings such as this are difficult to predict and a final outcome is unknown 
while reserving all rights  management believes it prudent to reserve for a probable loss related to this matter 
the reserve esti mates for this matter are subject to change as additional information becomes known 
however  at this point  management does not expect increases in its recorded estimated reserve 
as a result of management s assessment of the cpuc subpoena matter and the disallowance by the cpuc of costs associated with certain construction projects in its final decision on the region ii  region iii and general office rate case  gswc recorded a pretax charge for the impairment of assets and loss contingencies totaling million  or per share  in these reserve estimates may be adjusted as additional information becomes known

earnings for were largely impacted by i a pretax charge of million  or per share  for the impairment of assets and loss contingencies discussed previously  and ii pretax income of million  or per share  recorded during the first quarter of reflecting approval from the us government of requests for equitable adjustment  that were retroactive  for managing more infrastructure than originally estimated by the government in its solicitation of bids for operation of the water and wastewater facilities at fort bragg in north carolina and fort bliss in texas
