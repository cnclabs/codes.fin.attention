overview and outlook microsoft is a technology leader focused on helping people and businesses throughout the world realize their full potential 
we create technology that transforms the way people work  play and communicate across a wide range of computing devices 
we generate revenue by developing  licensing  and supporting a wide range of software products and services  by designing and selling hardware  and by delivering relevant online advertising to a global customer audience 
our most significant expenses are related to compensating employees  designing  manufacturing  marketing and selling our products and services  and income taxes 

table of contents part ii item industry trends our industry is dynamic and highly competitive  with frequent changes in both technologies and business models 
each industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products  new technologies  or new ideas which can further transform the industry and our business 
at microsoft  we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad set of research and technology innovations that seek to anticipate the changing demands of customers  industry trends  and competitive forces 
key opportunities and investments based on our assessment of key technology trends and our broad focus on long term research and development of new products and services  we see significant opportunities to drive future growth 
smart connected devices the price per unit of processing  storage  and networks continues to decline while at the same time devices increase in capability 
this ongoing trend is increasing the capabilities of pcs  mobile  and other devices powered by rich software platforms and applications 
at the same time  the information and services people use increasingly span multiple devices 
user experiences will be transformed by the adoption of cloud computing when brought together with the richness of smart  connected devices 
microsoft is delivering experiences that seamlessly connect pcs and mobile and other devices through the cloud 
we are devoting significant resources to consumer cloud offerings like bing  windows live  and xbox live 
our software and hardware platform investments can be seen in products like kinect  windows  windows azure  windows phone  windows server  and xbox 
cloud computing transforming the data center and information technology cloud based solutions provide customers with software  services and content over the internet by way of shared computing resources located in centralized data centers 
computing is undergoing a long term shift from client server to the cloud  a shift similar in importance and impact to the transition from mainframe to client server 
the shift to the cloud is driven by three important economies of scale larger data centers can deploy computational resources at significantly lower cost than smaller ones  larger data centers include diverse customer  geographic  and application demand patterns which improve the utilization of computing  storage  and network resources  and multi tenancy lowers application maintenance labor costs for large public clouds 
as a result of the improved economics  the cloud offers unique levels of elasticity and agility that will enable new solutions and applications 
for businesses of all sizes  the cloud creates the opportunity to focus more on innovation while leaving non differentiating activities to reliable and cost effective providers 
for most businesses  the first step in achieving cloud economics is the adoption of virtualization in their data center 
we are devoting significant resources to developing cloud infrastructure  platforms  and applications including offerings such as microsoft dynamics online  microsoft sql azure  office  windows azure  windows intune  and windows server 
entertainment the evolution of hardware  software  services  and the cloud are enhancing the delivery and quality of unified entertainment experiences across many devices 
these rich media experiences include games  movies  music  television  and social interactions with family  friends  and colleagues 
at microsoft  our approach is to simplify and increase the accessibility of these entertainment experiences to broaden market penetration of our software and services 
we invest significant resources in partnerships  content  windows phone  xbox  and xbox live 
search over the last two decades  web content and social connections have increased dramatically as people spend more time online  while discoverability and accessibility has been transforming from direct navigation and document links 
there is significant opportunity to deliver differentiated products that helps users make better decisions and 
table of contents part ii item complete tasks more simply when using pc  mobile  and other devices 
our approach is to use machine learning to try to understand user intent  and differentiate our product by focusing on the integration of visual  social  and other elements which simplifies people s interaction with the internet 
we invest significant resources in bing  sharepoint  windows  and windows phone 
communications and productivity personal and business productivity has been transformed by the ubiquity of computing and software tools 
over the last decade  microsoft redefined software productivity beyond the rich office client on the pc 
productivity scenarios now encompass unified communications  business intelligence  collaboration  content management  and relationship management  which are increasingly powered by server side applications 
these server applications can be hosted by the customer  a partner  or by microsoft in the cloud 
there are significant opportunities to provide productivity and communication scenarios across pcs  mobile devices  and other devices that connect to services 
we invest significant resources in dynamics  exchange  lync  office  office  sharepoint  and windows live 
economic conditions  challenges and risks as discussed above  our industry is dynamic and highly competitive 
we must anticipate changes in technology and business models 
our model for growth is based on our ability to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends  to enter new markets  both in terms of geographies and product areas  and to drive broad adoption of the products and services we develop and market 
at microsoft  we prioritize our investments among the highest long term growth opportunities 
these investments require significant resources and are multi year in nature 
the products and services we bring to market can be built internally  brought to market as part of a partnership or alliance  or through acquisition 
our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees 
we rely on hiring from a mix of university and industry talent worldwide 
microsoft competes for talented individuals worldwide by offering broad customer reach  scale in resources  and competitive compensation 
demand for our software  services  and hardware has a strong correlation to global macroeconomic factors 
the current macroeconomic factors remain dynamic 
see a discussion of these factors and other risks under risk factors part  item a

typically  the entertainment and devices division has generated approximately of its yearly segment revenue in our second fiscal quarter 
in addition  quarterly revenue may be impacted by the deferral of revenue 
see the discussions below regarding sales of earlier versions of the microsoft office system with a guarantee to be upgraded to the newest version of the microsoft office system at minimal or no cost the office deferral and sales of windows vista with a guarantee to be upgraded to windows at minimal or no cost and of windows to retailers before general availability the windows deferral

income taxes fiscal year compared with fiscal year our effective tax rates for fiscal years and were approximately and  respectively 
our effective tax rate was lower than the us federal statutory rate and our prior year effective rate primarily due to a higher mix of earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in ireland  singapore  and puerto rico  which are subject to 
table of contents part ii item lower income tax rates

during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the irs completed its examination and issued a revenue agent s report rar for the remaining unresolved items 
we do not agree with the adjustments in the rar  and we have filed a protest to initiate the administrative appeals process 
the proposed adjustments are primarily related to transfer pricing and could have a significant impact on our financial statements if not resolved favorably  however  we believe our existing reserves are adequate 
we do not believe it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next months  as we do not believe the appeals process will be concluded within the next months 
we also continue to be subject to examination by the irs for tax years to fiscal year compared with fiscal year our effective tax rates in fiscal years and were approximately and  respectively

our fixed income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk 
the credit risk and average maturity of our fixed income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed income indices 
the settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the short term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment grade fixed income securities 
while we own certain mortgage backed and asset backed fixed income securities  our portfolio as of june  does not contain direct exposure to subprime mortgages or structured vehicles that derive their value from subprime collateral 
the majority of our mortgage backed securities are collateralized by prime residential mortgages and carry a principal and interest guarantee  primarily from federal national mortgage association  federal home loan mortgage corporation  and government national mortgage association

securities lending we lend certain fixed income and equity securities to increase investment returns 
the loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet 
cash and or security interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower 
cash received is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability 
our securities lending payable balance was billion as of june  our average and maximum securities lending payable balances for the fiscal year were billion and billion  respectively 
intra year variances in the amount of securities loaned are mainly due to fluctuations in the demand for the securities 
valuation in general  and where applicable  we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments 
this pricing methodology applies to our level investments  such as exchange traded mutual funds  domestic and international equities  and us treasuries 
if quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value  then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly 
this pricing methodology applies to our level investments such as corporate notes and bonds  foreign government bonds  mortgage backed securities  and agency securities 
level investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs 
assets and liabilities measured using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio 
a majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally level or level investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments 
broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available  the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors  or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades 
our broker priced investments are generally labeled as level investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments 
in addition  all of our broker priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments 
our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded 
these controls include model validation  review of key model inputs  analysis of period over period fluctuations  and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate 
cash flows fiscal year compared with fiscal year cash flows from operations increased billion during the current fiscal year to billion due mainly to increased revenue and cash collections from customers

financing activities also included a billion increase in cash used for common stock repurchases  which was offset in part by a billion increase in cash received from common stock issued 
cash used for investing decreased billion due to a billion decrease in cash used for combined investment purchases  sales  and maturities along with a billion decrease in additions to property and equipment 
debt short term debt during fiscal year  we repaid billion of commercial paper  leaving zero outstanding 
on november   our billion day credit facility expired 
this facility served as a back up for our commercial paper program 
no amounts were drawn against the credit facility during any of the periods presented 
long term debt we issued debt during the periods presented to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets  reflecting our superior credit rating and the low interest rate environment 
the proceeds of these issuances were used to partially fund discretionary business acquisitions and share repurchases 
as of june   the total carrying value and estimated fair value of our long term debt  including convertible debt  were billion and billion  respectively 
this is compared to a carrying value and estimated fair value of billion and billion  respectively  as of june  the estimated fair value is based on quoted prices for our publicly traded debt as of june  and  as applicable 
the components of long term debt  the associated interest rates  and the semi annual interest record and payment dates were as follows as of june  due date face value stated interest rate effective interest rate interest record date interest pay date interest record date interest pay date in millions notes september   march march september september june   may june november december september   march march september september february  february february august august june   may june november december october   march april september october february  february february august august june  may june november december october   march april september october february   february february august august total convertible debt june  total unamortized discount total notes the notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt outstanding 

table of contents part ii item convertible debt in june  we issued billion of zero coupon convertible unsecured debt due on june  in a private placement offering 
proceeds from the offering were billion  net of fees and expenses  which were capitalized 
each  principal amount of notes is convertible into shares of microsoft common stock at a conversion price of per share 
as of june   the net carrying amount of our convertible debt was billion and the unamortized discount was million 
prior to march   the notes will be convertible  only in certain circumstances  into cash and  if applicable  cash  shares of microsoft s common stock  or a combination thereof  at our election 
on or after march   the notes will be convertible at any time 
upon conversion  we will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the notes and pay or deliver cash  shares of our common stock  or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock  at our election 
because the convertible debt may be wholly or partially settled in cash  we are required to separately account for the liability and equity components of the notes in a manner that reflects our nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest costs are recognized in subsequent periods 
the net proceeds of billion were allocated between debt for billion and stockholders equity for million with the portion in stockholders equity representing the fair value of the option to convert the debt 
in connection with the issuance of the notes  we entered into capped call transactions with certain option counterparties who are initial purchasers of the notes or their affiliates 
the capped call transactions are expected to reduce potential dilution of earnings per share upon conversion of the notes 
under the capped call transactions  we purchased from the option counterparties capped call options that in the aggregate relate to the total number of shares of our common stock underlying the notes  with a strike price equal to the conversion price of the notes and with a cap price equal to 
the purchased capped calls were valued at million and recorded to stockholders equity 
unearned revenue unearned revenue at june  comprised mainly unearned revenue from volume licensing programs 
unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings for multi year licensing arrangements paid for either at inception of the agreement or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period and accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period 
unearned revenue at june  also included payments for post delivery support and consulting services to be performed in the future  xbox live subscriptions and prepaid points  microsoft dynamics business solutions products  oem minimum commitments  unspecified upgrades enhancements of windows phone and microsoft internet explorer on a when and if available basis for windows xp  and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software  or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria 
the following table outlines the expected future recognition of unearned revenue as of june  in millions three months ending  september  december  march  june  thereafter total 
table of contents part ii item share repurchases on september   we announced the completion of the two repurchase programs approved by our board of directors during the first quarter of fiscal year the programs to buy back up to billion of microsoft common stock

as of june   approximately billion remained of the billion approved repurchase amount 
the repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice 
during the periods reported  we repurchased with cash resources million shares for billion during fiscal year  million shares for billion during fiscal year  and million shares for billion during fiscal year all shares repurchased in fiscal years and were repurchased under the program 
of the shares repurchased in fiscal year  million shares were repurchased for billion under the programs  while the remainder was repurchased under the program

in evaluating estimated losses on these indemnifications  we consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss 
to date  we have not encountered significant costs as a result of these obligations and have not accrued in our financial statements any liabilities related to these indemnifications

we have also excluded unearned revenue of billion and non cash items of million 
other planned uses of capital we will continue to invest in sales  marketing  product support infrastructure  and existing and advanced areas of technology 
additions to property and equipment will continue  including new facilities  data centers  and computer systems for research and development  sales and marketing  support  and administrative staff 
we have operating leases for most us and international sales and support offices and certain equipment 
we have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources 
definitive agreement with skype on may   we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement with skype global s rl skype under which we would acquire skype  a leading internet communications company  for billion in cash 
we anticipate the acquisition will extend skype s brand and reach of its network platform  while enhancing our existing portfolio of real time communications products and services 
the acquisition is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions 
we obtained regulatory approval in the us and expect to obtain all remaining required regulatory approvals during calendar year liquidity we earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the us  which is deemed to be permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions 
as a result  as discussed above under cash  cash equivalents  and investments  the majority of our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments are held by foreign subsidiaries 
we currently do not intend nor foresee a need to repatriate these funds 
we expect existing domestic cash  cash equivalents  
table of contents part ii item short term investments  and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities  such as regular quarterly dividends  debt repayment schedules  and material capital expenditures  for at least the next months and thereafter for the foreseeable future 
in addition  we expect existing foreign cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities  such as material capital expenditures  for at least the next months and thereafter for the foreseeable future 
should we require more capital in the us than is generated by our operations domestically  for example to fund significant discretionary activities  such as acquisitions of businesses and share repurchases  we could elect to repatriate future earnings from foreign jurisdictions or raise capital in the us through debt or equity issuances 
these alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates  increased interest expense  or other dilution of our earnings 
we have borrowed funds domestically and continue to have the ability to borrow funds domestically at reasonable interest rates 
as a result of the special dividend paid in the second quarter of fiscal year and shares repurchased  our retained deficit  including accumulated other comprehensive income  was billion at june  our retained deficit is not expected to affect our future ability to operate  pay dividends  or repay our debt given our continuing profitability and strong financial position 
recently issued accounting standards recently adopted accounting pronouncements on july   we adopted guidance issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb on revenue recognition 
under the new guidance on arrangements that include software elements  tangible products that have software components that are essential to the functionality of the tangible product are no longer within the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance  and software enabled products are now subject to other relevant revenue recognition guidance 
additionally  the fasb issued guidance on revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables that are outside the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance 
under the new guidance  when vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence for deliverables in an arrangement cannot be determined  a best estimate of the selling price is required to separate deliverables and allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method 
the new guidance includes new disclosure requirements on how the application of the relative selling price method affects the timing and amount of revenue recognition 
adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
on july   we adopted new guidance issued by the fasb on the consolidation of variable interest entities 
the new guidance requires revised evaluations of whether entities represent variable interest entities  ongoing assessments of control over such entities  and additional disclosures for variable interests 
adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted in june  the fasb issued guidance on presentation of comprehensive income 
the new guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity 
instead  an entity will be required to present either a continuous statement of net income and other comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the new guidance will be effective for us beginning july  and will have presentation changes only 
in may  the fasb issued guidance to amend the accounting and disclosure requirements on fair value measurements 
the new guidance limits the highest and best use measure to nonfinancial assets  permits certain financial assets and liabilities with offsetting positions in market or counterparty credit risks to be measured at a net basis  and provides guidance on the applicability of premiums and discounts 
additionally  the new guidance 
table of contents part ii item expands the disclosures on level inputs by requiring quantitative disclosure of the unobservable inputs and assumptions  as well as description of the valuation processes and the sensitivity of the fair value to changes in unobservable inputs 
the new guidance will be effective for us beginning january  other than requiring additional disclosures  we do not anticipate material impacts on our financial statements upon adoption 
in january  the fasb issued guidance to amend the disclosure requirements related to fair value measurements 
the guidance requires the disclosure of roll forward activities on purchases  sales  issuance  and settlements of the assets and liabilities measured using significant unobservable inputs level fair value measurements 
the guidance will become effective for us with the reporting period beginning july  other than requiring additional disclosures  the adoption of this new guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements 
application of critical accounting policies our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap 
preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies 
critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition  impairment of investment securities  goodwill  research and development costs  contingencies  income taxes  and stock based compensation 
revenue recognition software revenue recognition requires judgment  including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements  and if so  whether vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for those elements 
a portion of revenue may be recorded as unearned due to undelivered elements 
changes to the elements in a software arrangement  the ability to identify vsoe for those elements  and the fair value of the respective elements could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue 
judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products 
impairment of investment securities investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment 
this determination requires significant judgment 
in making this judgment  we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments 
if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value  we evaluate  among other factors  general market conditions  credit quality of debt instrument issuers  the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost  and for equity securities  our intent and ability to hold  or plans to sell  the investment 
for fixed income securities  we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery 
we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee  including industry and sector performance  changes in technology  and operational and financing cash flow factors 
once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary  an impairment charge is recorded to other income expense and a new cost basis in the investment is established 
if market  industry  and or investee conditions deteriorate  we may incur future impairments 
goodwill we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination 
we evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and  if necessary  reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach 
goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis may for us and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate  legal factors  operating performance indicators  competition  or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit 

table of contents part ii item application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units  assignment of goodwill to reporting units  and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit 
the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology 
this analysis requires significant judgments  including estimation of future cash flows  which is dependent on internal forecasts  estimation of the long term rate of growth for our business  estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur  and determination of our weighted average cost of capital 
among our reporting units  the fair value of osd has been the closest to its carrying value 
the carrying value of osd s goodwill was billion as of june  the estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results and market conditions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 
research and development costs costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product 
once technological feasibility is established  all software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers 
judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established 
we have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing 
generally  this occurs shortly before the products are released to manufacturing 
the amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products 
legal and other contingencies the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty 
an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred 
in determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate  among other factors  the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss 
changes in these factors could materially impact our financial statements 
income taxes the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities  classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities  accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions  and income tax disclosures 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial statements 
stock based compensation stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating expected dividends 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be impacted 

table of contents part ii item statement of management s responsibility for financial statements management is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related information that are presented in this report

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risks we are exposed to economic risk from foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  credit risk  equity prices  and commodity prices 
a portion of these risks is hedged  but they may impact our financial statements 
foreign currency certain forecasted transactions  assets  and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk 
we monitor our foreign currency exposures daily and use hedges where practicable to offset the risks and maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency positions 
principal currencies hedged include the euro  japanese yen  british pound  and canadian dollar 
interest rate our fixed income portfolio is diversified across credit sectors and maturities  consisting primarily of investment grade securities 
the credit risk and average maturity of the fixed income portfolio is managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain global and domestic fixed income indices 
in addition  we use to be announced forward purchase commitments of mortgage backed assets to gain exposure to agency and mortgage backed securities 
equity our equity portfolio consists of global  developed  and emerging market securities that are subject to market price risk 
we manage the securities relative to certain global and domestic indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices 
commodity we use broad based commodity exposures to enhance portfolio returns and facilitate portfolio diversification 
our investment portfolio has exposure to a variety of commodities  including precious metals  energy  and grain 
we manage these exposures relative to global commodity indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices 
value at risk we use a value at risk var model to estimate and quantify our market risks 
var is the expected loss  for a given confidence level  in the fair value of our portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon 
the var model is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value  including determinations of other than temporary losses in fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap  but is used as a risk estimation and management tool 
the distribution of the potential changes in total market value of all holdings is computed based on the historical volatilities and correlations among foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  equity prices  and commodity prices  assuming normal market conditions 
the var is calculated as the total loss that will not be exceeded at the percentile confidence level or  alternatively stated  the losses could exceed the var in out of  cases 
several risk factors are not captured in the model  including liquidity risk  operational risk  and legal risk 

table of contents part ii item a the following table sets forth the one day var for substantially all of our positions as of june  and and for the year ended june  in millions june  june  year ended june  risk categories average high low foreign currency interest rate equity commodity total one day var for the combined risk categories was million at june  and million at june  the total var is less at june   and less at june   than the sum of the separate risk categories in the above table due to the diversification benefit of the combination of risks
