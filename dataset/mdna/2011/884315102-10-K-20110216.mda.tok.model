item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview thomas betts corporation is a leading designer and manufacturer of essential components used to manage the connection  distribution  transmission and reliability of electrical products in industrial  construction and utility applications 
we are also a leading producer of commercial heating and ventilation units used in commercial and industrial buildings and highly engineered steel structures used for utility transmission 
we have operations in over countries 
manufacturing  marketing and sales activities are concentrated primarily in north america and europe 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements contained in this report requires the use of estimates and assumptions to determine certain amounts reported as net sales  costs  expenses  assets or liabilities and certain amounts disclosed as contingent assets or liabilities 
actual results may differ from those estimates or assumptions 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we believe our critical accounting policies include the following revenue recognition we recognize revenue when products are shipped and the customer takes ownership and assumes risk of loss  collection of the relevant receivable is probable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and the sales price is fixed or determinable 
we recognize revenue for service agreements over the applicable service periods 
sales discounts  quantity and price rebates  and allowances are estimated based on contractual commitments and experience and recorded as a reduction of revenue in the period in which the sale is recognized 
quantity rebates are in the form of volume incentive discount plans  which include specific sales volume targets or year over year sales volume growth targets for specific customers 
certain distributors can take advantage of price rebates by subsequently reselling our products into targeted construction projects or markets 
following a distributor s sale of an eligible product  the distributor submits a claim for a price rebate 
a number of distributors  primarily in our electrical segment  have the right to return goods under certain circumstances and those returns  which are reasonably estimable  are accrued as a reduction of revenue at the time of shipment 
we analyze historical returns and allowances  current economic trends and specific customer circumstances when evaluating the adequacy of accounts receivable related reserves and accruals 
we provide allowances for doubtful accounts when credit losses are both probable and estimable 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the first in  first out fifo method 
to ensure inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market  we periodically evaluate the carrying value of our inventories 
we also periodically perform an evaluation of inventory for excess and obsolete items 
such evaluations are based on management s judgment and use of estimates 
such estimates incorporate inventory quantities on hand  aging of the inventory  sales history and forecasts for particular product groupings  planned dispositions of product lines and overall industry trends 
goodwill and other intangible assets we apply the acquisition purchase method of accounting for all business combinations 
under this method  all assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination  including goodwill  indefinite lived intangibles and other intangibles  are recorded at fair value 
the purchase price allocation requires subjective page of 
table of contents judgments concerning estimates of the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities 
goodwill consists principally of the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations and is not amortized 
for each amortizable intangible asset  we use a method of amortization that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed 
if that pattern cannot be reliably determined  the straight line amortization method is used 
we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
we perform our annual impairment assessment as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year  unless circumstances dictate more frequent interim assessments 
in evaluating when an interim assessment of goodwill is necessary  we consider  among other things  the trading level of our common stock  changes in expected future cash flows and mergers and acquisitions involving companies in our industry 
in evaluating when an interim assessment of indefinite lived intangible assets is necessary  we review for significant events or significant changes in circumstances 
in conjunction with each test of goodwill we determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare the fair value to the reporting unit s carrying amount 
a reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment 
we determine the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of three valuation methods market multiple approach  discounted cash flow approach  and comparable transactions approach 
the market multiple approach provides indications of value based on market multiples for public companies involved in similar lines of business 
the discounted cash flow approach calculates the present value of projected future cash flows using appropriate discount rates 
the comparable transactions approach provides indications of value based on an examination of recent transactions in which companies in similar lines of business were acquired 
the fair values derived from these three valuation methods are then weighted to arrive at a single value for each reporting unit 
relative weights assigned to the three methods are based upon the availability  relevance and reliability of the underlying data 
we then reconcile the total values for all reporting units to our market capitalization and evaluate the reasonableness of the implied control premium 
to the extent a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  an indication exists that the reporting unit s goodwill may be impaired  and we must perform a second more detailed impairment assessment 
the second impairment assessment involves allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of its recognized and unrecognized assets and liabilities in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill as of the assessment date 
the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is then compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to quantify an impairment charge as of the assessment date 
methods used to determine fair values for indefinite lived intangible assets involve customary valuation techniques that are applicable to the particular class of intangible asset and apply inputs and assumptions that we believe a market participant would use 
long lived assets we review long lived assets to be held and used for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
indications of impairment require significant judgment by management 
for purposes of recognizing and measuring impairment of long lived assets  we evaluate assets at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows for associated product groups 
if the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the primary asset in the associated product groups is less than the carrying amount of the assets  the assets are considered to be impaired 
impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
when fair values page of 
table of contents are not available  we estimate fair values using the expected future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risks associated with the recovery of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to dispose 
pension and other postretirement benefit plan actuarial assumptions we recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of benefit plans in our consolidated balance sheets 
for purposes of calculating pension and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related costs  we use certain actuarial assumptions 
two critical assumptions  the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets  are important elements of expense and or liability measurement 
we evaluate these assumptions annually 
other assumptions include employee demographic factors retirement patterns  mortality and turnover  rate of compensation increase and the healthcare cost trend rate 
see additional information contained in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations qualified pension plans 
income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
this method recognizes the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between book and tax bases of assets and liabilities and requires an evaluation of asset realizability based on a more likely than not criteria 
we have valuation allowances for deferred tax assets primarily associated with foreign net operating loss carryforwards and foreign income tax credit carryforwards 
realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income 
we believe that it is more likely than not that future taxable income  based on enacted tax laws in effect as of december   will be sufficient to realize the recorded deferred tax assets net of existing valuation allowances 
environmental costs environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized  as appropriate 
remediation costs that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations are accrued when it is probable that those costs will be incurred and can be reasonably estimated based on evaluations of currently available facts related to each site 
the operation of manufacturing plants involves a high level of susceptibility in these areas  and requires subjective judgements by management in assessing environmental or occupational health and safety liabilities
