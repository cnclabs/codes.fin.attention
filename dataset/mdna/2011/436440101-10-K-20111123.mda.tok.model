item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the information described under the caption risk factors included elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a developer  manufacturer and supplier of premium diagnostics  medical imaging systems and surgical products dedicated to the healthcare needs of women 
our core business segments are focused on breast health  diagnostics  gyn surgical and skeletal health 
our breast health products include a broad portfolio of breast imaging and related products and accessories  including digital and film based mammography systems  magnetic resonance imaging mri breast coils  computer aided detection cad for mammography and mri  minimally invasive breast biopsy devices  breast biopsy site markers  breast biopsy guidance systems  breast imaging comfort pads  and breast brachytherapy products 
we have also developed a new breast imaging platform  dimensions  which utilizes a new technology  tomosynthesis  to produce three dimensional d images  as well as conventional two dimensional d full field digital mammography images 
in the us  our dimensions product had previously been approved by the food and drug administration fda for providing conventional d images 
on february   we received approval from the fda to enable the d tomosynthesis capability of our dimensions system 
the fda granted approval for the use of d tomosynthesis in addition to a conventional d digital image 
our clinical results for the approval demonstrated that conventional d digital mammography with the addition of d tomosynthesis is superior to d digital mammography alone for both screening and diagnostics 
we began to sell our dimensions d tomosynthesis system in the united states immediately following fda approval 
we had been selling dimensions d tomosynthesis outside of the united states in regions such as canada  europe  latin america and asia 
in august  we acquired sentinelle medical inc sentinelle medical  a company that develops  manufactures and markets mri coils including mri breast coils  patient positioners and visualization software mri cad 
sentinelle medical  which is included within our breast health segment  is dedicated to developing advanced imaging technologies used in high field strength mri systems 
in july  we completed our acquisition of beijing healthcome technology company  ltd 
healthcome  a privately held manufacturer of medical equipment  including mammography equipment  located in beijing  china 
the operations of sentinelle medical and healthcome have been integrated into our breast health segment 
our diagnostics products include the thinprep system  which is primarily used in cytology applications such as cervical cancer screening  the rapid fetal fibronectin test  which assists physicians in assessing the risk of pre term birth  and our molecular diagnostic reagents used for a variety of dna and rna analysis applications based on our proprietary invader chemistry 
our current molecular diagnostic offerings based upon this invader chemistry include cervista hpv high risk hr and cervista hpv products to assist in the diagnosis of human papillomavirus hpv  as well as other products to diagnose cystic fibrosis  cardiovascular risk and other diseases 
in june   we acquired tct international co  ltd 
tct and subsidiaries  a privately held distributor of medical products  including the company s thinprep pap test  related instruments and other diagnostic and surgical products 
tct s operating subsidiaries are located in beijing  china 
our acquisition of tct provides us with an established nationwide sales organization and customer support infrastructure in china 
tct is primarily reported within our diagnostics segment and to a lesser extent within our gyn surgical segment 
our gyn surgical products include the novasure endometrial ablation system  the myosure hysteroscopic tissue removal system  and the adiana permanent contraception system 
the novasure system is a minimally invasive procedure for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding 
the myosure system is a tissue removal device that is designed to provide incision less removal of fibroids and polyps within the uterus 
the 
table of contents adiana system is a form of permanent female contraception intended as an alternative to tubal ligation 
the myosure system was added to the gyn surgical product portfolio as a result of our acquisition of interlace medical  inc interlace on january  the operations of interlace have been integrated into our gyn surgical segment 
our skeletal health products include dual energy x ray bone densitometry systems  an ultrasound based osteoporosis assessment product  and our fluoroscan mini c arm imaging products 
recent developments market acceptance of our medical products in the united states and other countries is dependent upon the medical equipment purchasing and procurement practices of our customers  patient demand for our products and procedures and the reimbursement of patients medical expenses by government healthcare programs  private insurers or other healthcare payors 
the continuing uncertainty surrounding worldwide financial markets and macroeconomic conditions has caused and may continue to cause the purchasers of medical equipment to decrease or delay their medical equipment purchasing and procurement activities 
additionally  constrictions in world credit markets have caused and continue to cause our customers to experience difficulty securing the financing necessary to purchase our products 
economic uncertainty and unemployment have and may continue to result in cost conscious consumers focusing on acute care rather than wellness  which has and may continue to adversely affect demand for our products and procedures 
furthermore  governments and other third party payors around the world facing tightening budgets could move to further reduce the reimbursement rates or the scope of coverage offered  which could adversely affect sales of our products 
if the current adverse macroeconomic conditions continue  our business and prospects may be negatively impacted 
in march  significant reforms to the healthcare system were adopted as law in the united states 
the law includes provisions that  among other things  reduce and or limit medicare reimbursement  require all individuals to have health insurance with limited exceptions and imposes new and or increased taxes 
specifically  the law requires the medical device industry to subsidize healthcare reform in the form of a excise tax on us sales of certain medical devices beginning in we expect that our products will fall under the government classification requiring the excise tax 
us net product sales represented  and of our worldwide net product sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
as we operate in a highly regulated industry  other governmental actions may adversely affect our business  operations or financial condition  including  without limitation new laws  regulations or judicial decisions  or new interpretations of existing laws  regulations or decisions  related to health care availability  method of delivery and payment for health care products and services  changes in the fda and foreign regulatory approval processes that may delay or prevent the approval of new products and result in lost market opportunity  changes in fda and foreign regulations that may require additional safety monitoring  labeling changes  restrictions on product distribution or use  or other measures after the introduction of our products to market  which could increase our costs of doing business  adversely affect the future permitted uses of approved products  or otherwise adversely affect the market for our products and treatments  new laws  regulations and judicial decisions affecting pricing or marketing practices  and changes in the tax laws relating to our operations  including those associated with the recently adopted healthcare reform law discussed above 
professional societies  government agencies  practice management groups  private health science foundations  and organizations involved in healthcare issues may publish guidelines  recommendations or studies to the healthcare and patient communities from time to time 
recommendations of government agencies or these other groups organizations may relate to such matters as usage  cost effectiveness  and use of related therapies 
organizations like these have recently and in the past made recommendations about our products and those of our competitors 
recommendations  guidelines or studies that are followed by patients and healthcare providers could result in decreased use of our products 
a number of healthcare related organizations and agencies have issued or proposed contrasting recommendations  and some of these current recommendations could significantly reduce the amount of screening using our thinprep  cervista hpv  selenia  dimensions and related products and 
table of contents adversely affect the sale of those products 
for example  in november  the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists acog changed their recommendations for pap smear screening  and the united states preventive services task force uspstf changed their recommendations for mammography screening  both of which recommended less frequent testing 
however  in july  acog changed its breast cancer screening guidelines recommending that mammography screening be offered annually to women beginning at age instead of in october  the uspstf published draft guidelines for public comment on cervical cancer screening in which they have recommended less frequent testing and no hpv co testing 
recently  there have been periodic significant fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar 
the ongoing fluctuations of the value of the us dollar  including the recent strengthening of the us dollar against the euro  may cause our products to be less competitive in international markets and may impact sales and profitability over time 
historically  a majority of our capital equipment sales to international dealers have been denominated in us dollars 
however  we have seen a shift of more sales being denominated in the euro compared to the us dollar for our euro zone dealers 
in addition  we have international sales  principally in our diagnostics segment  that are denominated in foreign currencies 
the value of these sales is also impacted by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar 
given the uncertainty in the worldwide financial markets  foreign currency fluctuations may be significant in the future  and if the us dollar continues to strengthen  we may experience a material adverse effect on our international revenues and operating results 
acquisitions fiscal acquisitions tct international co  ltd 
on june   we acquired tct  a privately held distributor of medical products  including our thinprep pap test  related instruments and other diagnostic and surgical products 
tct s operating subsidiaries are located in beijing  china 
our acquisition of tct enabled us to obtain an established nationwide sales organization and customer support infrastructure in china as we execute on our strategy to expand internationally 
the preliminary purchase price of million is comprised of million in cash  of which million was paid up front and million plus a working capital adjustment  which has been preliminarily estimated to be million  are deferred for one year 
these amounts may be subject to further adjustment 
the deferred payment has been recorded on a present value basis of million in purchase accounting to reflect fair value and such payment is being accreted through interest expense over this one year period 
in addition  the majority of the former shareholders of tct will receive two annual contingent earn out payments subject to adjustment not to exceed million less the deferred payment 
subsequent to the acquisition date  our results of operations include the results of tct  which are primarily reported within our diagnostics reporting segment and to a lesser extent within our gyn surgical reporting segment 
we accounted for the tct acquisition as a purchase of a business under accounting standards codification asc  business combinations 
the allocation of the purchase price is based upon preliminary estimates of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of june  the purchase price in excess of net tangible assets acquired was allocated to identifiable intangible assets comprised of customer relationships of million  business licenses of million and trade names of million  based upon a detailed valuation that relies on projections and assumptions 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed was allocated to goodwill of million 
the contingent earn out payments are based on a multiple of incremental revenue growth for the one year periods beginning january  and january  as compared to the respective prior year periods  and are payable after the first and second anniversaries from the date of acquisition  respectively 
since these payments are contingent on future employment  they are being recognized as compensation expense ratably over the required service periods  the first and second year anniversaries from the date of acquisition 
based on our revenue projections for the tct business  we recorded compensation expense of million in fiscal 
table of contents interlace medical  inc on january   we acquired interlace  a privately held company located in framingham  massachusetts 
interlace is the developer  manufacturer and supplier of myosure 
the purchase price was comprised of million in cash initial consideration  which was net of certain adjustments  plus two annual contingent payments up to a maximum of an additional million in cash 
subsequent to the acquisition date  our results of operations include the results of interlace  which has been integrated within our gyn surgical reporting segment 
we accounted for the interlace acquisition as a purchase of a business under asc the allocation of the purchase price is based upon preliminary estimates of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of january  the purchase price in excess of net tangible assets acquired was allocated to identifiable intangible assets comprised of developed technology of million and trade names of million  based upon a detailed valuation that relies on projections and assumptions 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed was allocated to goodwill of million 
in addition to the initial consideration  million was paid to certain employees upon the completion of three and six months of service from the date of acquisition 
since these payments were contingent on future employment  they were recognized as compensation expense 
the agreement includes an indemnification provision that provides for the reimbursement of a portion of legal expenses in defense of the interlace intellectual property 
we have the right to collect certain amounts set aside in escrow from the initial consideration and  as applicable  offset contingent consideration payments of qualifying legal costs 
the contingent payments are based on a multiple of incremental revenue growth during a two year period following the completion of the acquisition 
pursuant to asc  we have recorded an estimate of the fair value of the contingent consideration liability based on future revenue projections of the interlace business under various potential scenarios and weighted probability assumptions of these outcomes 
as of the date of acquisition  these cash flow projections were discounted using a rate of 
the discount rate is based on the weighted average cost of capital of the acquired business plus a credit risk premium for non performance risk related to the liability pursuant to asc this analysis resulted in an initial contingent consideration liability of million  which will be adjusted periodically as a component of operating expenses based on changes in fair value of the liability driven by the accretion of the liability for the time value of money and changes in the assumptions pertaining to the achievement of the defined revenue growth milestones 
this fair value measurement is based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represented a level measurement as defined in asc  fair value measurements 
as of september   there were no significant changes in the estimated outcomes for the contingent consideration recognized 
in connection with updating the fair value calculation for accretion as of september   we recorded a charge of million in fiscal to record the liability at its fair value of million 
beijing healthcome technology company  ltd 
on july   we completed our acquisition of healthcome  a privately held manufacturer of medical equipment  including mammography equipment  located in beijing  china 
the purchase price was million in cash  subject to adjustment  which is estimated to include a working capital reduction of million 
in addition  we are obligated to make future payments to the shareholders  who remain employed  up to an additional million over three years 
since these payments are contingent on future employment  they are being recognized as compensation expense ratably over the respective service periods 
based on the terms of the contingent consideration arrangements  we recorded million of compensation expense in fiscal 
table of contents the allocation of the purchase price is based upon preliminary estimates of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of july  the purchase price in excess of net tangible assets acquired was allocated to identifiable intangible assets comprised of developed technology of million  in process research and development of million and trade names of million  based upon a detailed valuation that relies on projections and assumptions 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed was allocated to goodwill of million 
fiscal acquisitions sentinelle medical inc on august   we acquired sentinelle medical  a privately held company located in toronto  canada 
the purchase price was comprised of an million cash payment  which was net of certain adjustments  plus three contingent payments over a two year period up to a maximum of an additional million in cash 
subsequent to the acquisition date  our results of operations include the results of sentinelle medical  which is a component of our breast health reporting segment 
we accounted for the sentinelle acquisition as a purchase of a business under asc the allocation of the purchase price was based upon estimates of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of august  the purchase price in excess of net tangible assets acquired was allocated to identifiable intangible assets aggregating million  primarily comprised of developed technology of million and in process research and development projects of million  based upon a detailed valuation that relies on projections and assumptions 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed was allocated to goodwill of million 
the amount allocated to acquired in process research and development represented the estimated fair value of in process projects based on risk adjusted cash flows utilizing a discount rate of 
these in process projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no future alternative uses as of the date of the acquisition 
the primary basis for determining the technological feasibility of these projects was obtaining regulatory approval to market the underlying products 
the acquired in process research and development assets are not subject to amortization until the projects are complete  at which time  they will be amortized over their estimated remaining useful lives ranging from to years 
these projects relate to a prostate mri coil and certain software 
we received fda approval for both projects in fiscal the contingent payments are based on a multiple of incremental revenue growth during the two year period following the completion of the acquisition 
pursuant to asc  we have recorded an estimate of the fair value of the contingent consideration liability based on future revenue projections of the sentinelle medical business under various potential scenarios and weighted probability assumptions of these outcomes 
as of the date of acquisition  these cash flow projections were discounted using a rate of 
the discount rate is based on the weighted average cost of capital of the acquired business plus a credit risk premium for non performance risk related to the liability pursuant to asc this analysis resulted in an initial contingent consideration liability of million  which will be adjusted periodically as a component of operating expenses based on changes in fair value of the liability driven by the accretion of the liability for the time value of money and changes in the assumptions pertaining to the achievement of the defined revenue growth milestones 
this fair value measurement is based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represents a level measurement as defined in asc during each quarter in fiscal  we have re evaluated our assumptions and updated the revenue and probability assumptions for future earn out periods and lowered our projections 
as a result of these adjustments  which were partially offset by the accretion of the liability using a current discount rate of approximately  we recorded a reversal of expense of million in fiscal to record the contingent consideration liability at fair value 
in addition  during the second quarter of fiscal  the first earn out period ended  and we adjusted the fair value of the contingent consideration liability for actual results during the earn out period 
this payment of million was made in the third quarter of fiscal at september   the fair value of the liability is million

table of contents fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  product sales 
years ended september  september  change amount of total revenue amount of total revenue amount product sales breast health diagnostics gyn surgical skeletal health in fiscal  our product sales increased million  or  compared to fiscal due to an increase in revenues of million from breast health  million from gyn surgical  million from diagnostics  and million from skeletal health 
breast health product sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to growth in our breast biopsy products of million  the inclusion of a full year of revenues from sentinelle medical acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal  which increased million  and a favorable foreign currency impact of million 
the increase in breast biopsy products revenue is primarily attributable to an increase in the number of eviva biopsy devices sold with the largest increase in the us overall  our digital mammography systems revenues decreased million in fiscal compared to fiscal we experienced a decrease in the number of selenia systems sold worldwide  and to a lesser extent  selenia product mix and configuration differences resulted in lower revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal we sold a greater number of our selenia value related models and a lesser amount of our full featured selenia models in fiscal our value related models have lower average selling prices than our full featured selenia models 
in addition  we sold more selenia systems internationally as a percentage of total selenia systems and average selling prices are lower in our international markets compared to the domestic market 
mostly offsetting these decreases was an increase in the number of units sold of our new d d dimensions products as these systems continue to gain traction 
these systems also have higher average selling prices than our selenia systems 
we expect the shift in sales from our selenia to our dimensions products to continue as we received fda approval of our d tomosynthesis capability in february diagnostics product sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to an increase in revenues from our cervista hpv tests  the inclusion of tct acquired in the third quarter of fiscal resulting in incremental revenues of approximately million  a favorable foreign currency impact of million and to a lesser extent an increase in the number of thinprep pap tests sold internationally  partially offset by a reduction in domestic sales 
cervista hpv revenues have increased as we continue to gain new customer accounts and unit sales to existing customers increase 
we believe the decline in the number of thinprep pap tests sold domestically is due to the decline in patient visits year over year attributable to the lagging effects of unemployment  continuing economic uncertainty  recent changes in cervical cancer screening guidelines to extend the recommended intervals between such screenings  and to a lesser extent laboratory consolidation 
gyn surgical product sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal due to an increase in the number of adiana systems sold and the inclusion of myosure system sales acquired in the second quarter of fiscal 
novasure system sales were essentially flat year over year 
while we experienced an increase in the number of novasure devices sold internationally and to a lesser extent a slight increase in average selling prices  these increases were offset by a decline in the number of novasure devices sold domestically 
we believe the decline in units sold domestically is due to the lagging effects of unemployment and continuing economic uncertainty  which has resulted in patients delaying surgery and opting for lower cost and generally less effective alternatives 

table of contents skeletal health product sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to a million increase in osteoporosis assessment product sales worldwide 
offsetting this increase in fiscal was a reduction in mini c arm revenues of million due to a decrease in the number of units sold domestically and slightly lower average selling prices in fiscal compared to fiscal in fiscal  of product sales were generated in the united states  in europe  in asia pacific  and in other international markets 
in fiscal  of product sales were generated in the united states  in europe  in asia pacific  and in other international markets 
service and other revenues 
years ended september  september  change amount of total revenue amount of total revenue amount service and other revenues service and other revenues are primarily comprised of revenue generated from our field service organization to provide ongoing service  installation and repair of our products 
service and other revenues increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily in our breast health business due to an increase in the number of service contracts driven by an increase in our installed base of our digital mammography systems  which are no longer under warranty 
cost of product sales 
years ended september  september  change amount of product sales amount of product sales amount cost of product sales cost of product sales amortization of intangible assets cost of product sales impairment of intangible assets product sales gross margin increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal primarily due to the significant intangible asset charge of million recorded in fiscal related to mammosite 
cost of product sales 
the cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales was in fiscal compared to in fiscal in fiscal  cost of product sales as a percentage of product revenues increased in breast health compared to fiscal and was relatively flat in diagnostics  gyn surgical and skeletal health compared to fiscal the decline in breast health gross margin in fiscal was primarily due to million of additional costs related to the sale of acquired sentinelle medical inventory written up to fair value in purchase accounting  unfavorable absorption and higher production spend principally in the digital mammography product lines  and a mix shift in sales of our selenia product line 
our selenia value related models have lower average selling prices and gross margins than our full featured selenia models 
in addition  we sold more selenia systems internationally as a percentage of total selenia systems  where our average selling prices are lower 
partially offsetting these decreases were higher sales of dimensions d and d tomosynthesis software upgrades 
the dimensions d product has a higher average selling price and gross margin compared to 
table of contents our full featured selenia models 
within our breast biopsy products  the mix of products sold resulted in lower gross margins as we sold more eviva disposables and less atec disposables as a percentage of revenue compared to fiscal eviva disposables have a lower gross margin than our atec disposables because they have a higher manufacturing cost and carry additional royalty charges 
cost of product sales amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets relates to acquired developed technology 
these intangible assets are generally amortized over their estimated useful lives of between and years using a straight line method or  if reliably determinable  based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the assets are expected to be consumed 
the economic pattern is based on undiscounted future cash flows 
the increase in amortization expense in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the inclusion of additional amortization expense related to the technology assets acquired from the sentinelle medical and interlace acquisitions in the fourth quarter of fiscal and second quarter of fiscal  respectively 
in addition  there was an increase in amortization expense in the current year due to the method of recognition based on the expected economic benefits of the underlying assets  primarily related to the intangible assets acquired in the cytyc merger in the first quarter of fiscal offsetting this increase was a decline in amortization expense in fiscal related to our mammosite reporting unit 
we recorded an impairment charge for its developed technology in the fourth quarter of fiscal  as discussed below  resulting in a reduced asset value and lower future amortization expense 
cost of product sales impairment of intangible assets 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal in connection with our company wide annual budgeting and strategic planning process  we identified indicators of impairment in our mammosite reporting unit due to changing market conditions for the breast brachytherapy market  including downward pressure on procedure volumes from the continuing adverse macroeconomic environment and current trends in breast cancer management  as well as competitive pricing pressures and competition from existing and alternative new technologies 
these factors resulted in lowering our financial projections for mammosite 
we performed the first step in the long lived assets impairment test and compared mammosite s forecasted undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value of its net assets  which indicated that these cash flows were insufficient to recover mammosite s carrying value 
therefore  we determined the fair value of mammosite s long lived assets  which are primarily intangible assets  using a discounted cash flow technique 
based on the fair value of the long lived assets  we recorded an impairment charge of million to developed technology in the fourth quarter of fiscal for additional information  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report 
cost of service and other revenues 
years ended september  september  change amount of service and other revenues amount of service and other revenues amount cost of service and other revenues service and other revenues gross margin has improved to in fiscal compared to in fiscal primarily due to the improved absorption of fixed service costs and the continued growth of service contract revenue  primarily in the breast health business 
we have been able to convert a high percentage of our domestic installed base of digital mammography systems to service contracts upon the expiration of the warranty period 
in addition  warranty costs have decreased due to lower failure rates in certain of our products 

table of contents operating expenses 
years ended september  september  change amount of total revenue amount of total revenue amount operating expenses research and development selling and marketing general and administrative amortization of intangible assets contingent consideration compensation expense contingent consideration fair value adjustments impairment of goodwill impairment of intangible assets gain on sale of intellectual property  net litigation settlement charges  net acquired in process research and development restructuring and divestiture charges  net research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase was primarily due to the inclusion of additional expenses from sentinelle medical acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal and interlace acquired in the second quarter of fiscal 
in the current year  compensation and benefits increased due to an increase in headcount  annual salary increases  and higher bonuses based on improved company performance compared to the prior year 
in addition  there was an increase in clinical trials and research projects spend primarily attributable to next generation novasure and adiana products  partially offset by a reduction in clinical trial and project spend on the dimensions d tomosynthesis product  which was approved by the fda in february research and development primarily reflects spending on new product development programs  regulatory compliance and clinical research and trials 
at any point in time  we have a number of different research projects and clinical trials being conducted and the timing of these projects and related costs can vary period to period 
selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses increased in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase was primarily due to additional expenses from the inclusion of sentinelle medical  interlace and tct  expenditures for our direct to consumer advertising campaign for the novasure system  higher spending for other marketing and advertising initiatives including the dimensions d product launch  increased compensation and benefits related to an increase in headcount  annual salary increases and higher bonuses based on improved company performance compared to the prior year  and medical education 
partially offsetting these increases were lower distributor and third party commissions 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to additional expenses from the inclusion of sentinelle medical  interlace and tct  an increase in compensation and benefits primarily due to an increase in headcount  annual salary increases  higher bonuses due to improved company performance compared to the prior year  and additional expenses related to consummating our acquisitions and integrating them into our operations  including 
table of contents accounting and tax services 
in the current year  these increases were partially offset by a decrease in litigation costs due to lower activity compared to fiscal  in which a number of matters were resolved  primarily the ethicon lawsuit 
amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets results from customer relationships  trade names  business licenses and non compete agreements related to our acquisitions 
these intangible assets are generally amortized over their estimated useful lives of between and years using a straight line method or  if reliably determinable  based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the assets are expected to be consumed 
the increase in fiscal compared to fiscal is due to the addition of intangible assets from the sentinelle medical  interlace and tct acquisitions  and an increase in amortization due to the method of recognition based on the expected economic benefits of the underlying assets  primarily related to the intangible assets acquired in the cytyc merger in the first quarter of fiscal contingent consideration compensation expense 
in connection with our recent acquisitions  we are obligated to make contingent earn out payments 
amounts recorded in this financial statement line item are those contingent payments that are contingent on future employment 
these payments are also generally based on achieving certain performance milestones  typically incremental revenue growth  as is the case for tct 
the amounts recorded related to interlace and healthcome are solely related to continuing employment 
in fiscal  we recorded an aggregate charge of million comprised of million  million and million related to tct  interlace and healthcome  respectively 
for additional information  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report 
contingent consideration fair value adjustments 
in connection with the purchase price allocation for our acquisitions of sentinelle medical and interlace  we recorded an estimate of the fair value of the contingent consideration liability for each acquisition as required by us generally accepted accounting principles 
this liability is not contingent on future employment and is based on future revenue projections of the respective businesses under various potential scenarios and weighted probability assumptions of these outcomes 
this analysis is updated quarterly and changes to the fair value of this liability are recorded in the statements of operations 
as a result  we recorded a net credit of million in fiscal reflecting a net decrease in the fair values of these liabilities comprised of reduction in the fair value of the sentinelle medical liability of million due primarily to changes in revenue assumptions offset by a charge of million related to interlace based primarily on the accretion of the liability to the expected payment amount 
for additional information  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report 
impairment of goodwill 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  in connection with performing our company wide annual budgeting and forecasting process  we determined that there were indicators of impairment related to our mammosite reporting unit  and we recorded intangible asset impairment charges discussed above and below 
the fair value of this reporting unit declined from fiscal primarily due to our reassessment of the overall market size of breast brachytherapy and a reduction in long term growth projections 
after determining the fair values of mammosite s long lived assets  other than goodwill  and writing these assets down to their fair values  we performed the step goodwill impairment test for mammosite 
as a result of this analysis  we recorded a million goodwill impairment charge 
no other reporting units were deemed to be impaired in fiscal for additional information  refer to note intangible assets and goodwill to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report 
impairment of intangible assets 
as noted above under cost of product sales impairment of intangible assets  in fiscal  we determined that the long lived assets in the mammosite reporting unit were impaired 
as a result of this analysis  we recorded a million charge in fiscal to write down customer relationships and trade name intangible assets to their fair values 
for additional information  refer to note intangible assets and goodwill to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report 

table of contents gain on sale of intellectual property  net 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we received fda approval of makena  formerly known as gestiva  and all rights to makena were transferred to k v pharmaceutical company kv pursuant to our agreement in which we sold the exclusive worldwide rights of makena to kv 
upon transfer  we received million  and including the million received in prior years  we recorded a gain on the sale of intellectual property  net of the write off of certain assets  of million in the second quarter of fiscal for additional information on this arrangement and amounts we may receive in the future  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report 
litigation settlement charges  net 
in fiscal  we incurred a charge of million relating to the settlement of three insignificant cases 
in fiscal  we incurred litigation settlement charges of million primarily relating to our litigation with ethicon endo surgery  inc ethicon 
we had been engaged in litigation in which ethicon had alleged patent infringement by our atec biopsy system of certain of their patents  and ethicon had made similar claims of our eviva biopsy system 
on february   we entered into a settlement agreement with ethicon  and all outstanding litigation between the parties was dismissed 
in connection with the settlement agreement  we agreed to make a one time payment to ethicon of million and ongoing royalties for sales of our atec and eviva products  and ethicon agreed to pay us ongoing royalties for sales of its mammotome magnetic resonance imaging product 
acquired in process research and development 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we acquired certain assets that were determined to have no future alternative use and recorded a million charge within our diagnostics segment 
restructuring and divestiture charges  net 
during the fourth quarter we terminated the employment of certain employees and recorded a severance benefits charge of million  which was offset by a gain of million related to the sale of an insignificant product line 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we terminated the employment of certain employees in connection with completing the sentinelle medical acquisition and recorded severance and related benefit costs of million 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we completed the sale of the capital stock of our organic photoconductor drum coating manufacturing operation in shanghai  china for a net sales price of million resulting in a loss on disposal of million 
as a result of previously closing this facility  we incurred additional net charges of million in fiscal interest income 
years ended september  september  change amount amount amount interest income interest income increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents

provision for income taxes 
years ended september  september  change amount amount amount provision for income taxes our effective tax rate for fiscal was of pre tax earnings compared to of the pre tax loss in fiscal the effective tax rate in fiscal was less than the statutory rate primarily due to the reversal of income tax reserves  the section manufacturing deduction for domestic production activities  and us and 
table of contents canadian research and development tax credits 
the reversal of million of income tax reserves was due to the closure of the united states internal revenue service federal audit for fiscal years  and and the expiration of the statute of limitations in various domestic federal and state and foreign jurisdictions 
our effective tax rate for fiscal was significantly impacted by the million goodwill impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter  substantially all of which was not deductible for tax purposes 
we anticipate an effective tax rate of approximately of pre tax earnings in fiscal segment results of operations we report our business as four segments breast health  diagnostics  gyn surgical and skeletal health 
the accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the footnotes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report 
we measure segment performance based on total revenues and operating income or loss 
revenues from product sales of each of these segments are described in further detail above 
the discussion that follows is a summary analysis of total revenues and the primary changes in operating income or loss by segment 
breast health 
years ended september  september  change amount amount amount total revenues operating income loss operating income loss as a of segment revenue breast health revenues increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to a million increase in service revenues that is substantially related to additional service contracts for the increased number of digital mammography systems in our installed base and the increase in product revenues of million discussed above 
operating income for this business segment increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to a million intangible asset and goodwill impairment charge related to our mammosite reporting unit recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal discussed above 
the balance of the increase in fiscal  million  was primarily due to increased gross margin on an absolute dollar basis as a result of higher product and service revenues as discussed above and lower operating expenses 
overall the gross margin rate as a percentage of revenues increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal primarily due to the million impairment charge to mammosite s developed technology included in fiscal in addition  in fiscal  there have been improvements in service gross margins and lower intangible asset amortization expense resulting from the write off of mammosite intangibles in the fourth quarter of fiscal in fiscal  overall gross margin  excluding the impact of the mammosite impairment charge  was 
operating expenses for this business segment decreased million in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the impact of the goodwill and intangible asset charge of million recorded in operating expenses in fiscal other operating expense decreases in fiscal included a net credit of million related to adjusting the sentinelle medical contingent consideration to fair value  lower clinical trials spending related to our dimensions d tomosynthesis system  lower third party commissions  lower intangible asset amortization from the write off of mammosite intangibles in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and a decrease in litigation costs 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded a litigation settlement charge of million as discussed above 
partially offsetting these operating expense decreases was the inclusion of a 
table of contents full year of expenses for sentinelle medical acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and higher compensation costs related to hiring additional personnel  annual salary increases  higher bonuses due to improved company performance and higher sales commissions for our breast biopsy business 
diagnostics 
years ended september  september  change amount amount amount total revenues operating income operating income as a of segment revenue diagnostics revenues increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the increase in product sales discussed above 
operating income increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the net gain of million on the sale of the makena intellectual property to kv in the second quarter of fiscal discussed above and an increase in gross margin in absolute dollars due to higher revenues 
gross margin rates were and in fiscal and  respectively 
these increases were partially offset by higher operating expenses attributable to the inclusion of tct acquired in the third quarter of fiscal and related integration costs and contingent consideration compensation expense of million  and higher compensation costs related to hiring additional personnel  annual salary increases  and higher bonuses due to improved company performance 
gyn surgical 
years ended september  september  change amount amount amount total revenues operating income operating income as a of segment revenue gyn surgical revenues increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the increase in product sales discussed above 
operating income decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the inclusion of interlace s operations acquired in the second quarter of fiscal  including intangible asset amortization expense  a charge of million to adjust the interlace contingent consideration liability to fair value and a charge of million to record interlace contingent consideration compensation expense as payments were tied to continuing employment 
overall  gross margin in absolute dollars decreased slightly in fiscal compared to fiscal this segment s gross margin rates declined to compared to in fiscal  primarily due to higher intangible asset amortization expense 
in addition  this segment incurred higher operating expenses  principally in sales and marketing for increased advertising of the novasure system  including expenditures related to our direct to consumer advertising campaign  an increase in compensation and benefits related to hiring additional personnel  annual salary increases  and higher bonuses due to improved company performance  increased amortization expense from intangible assets  and higher project expense on the development of next generation products 
in addition  the first quarter of fiscal included the reversal of stock compensation due to the departure of a senior executive 

table of contents skeletal health

operating income increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the increase in revenues and improvement in gross margin rates to compared to in the prior year 
operating expenses remained relatively flat 
fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  product sales 
years ended september  september  change amount of total revenue amount of total revenue amount product sales breast health diagnostics gyn surgical skeletal health in fiscal  our product sales decreased million  or  compared to fiscal primarily due to a decrease of million in our breast health products and to a lesser extent a million decline in skeletal health products partially offset by increases in gyn surgical and diagnostic products of million and million  respectively 
breast health product sales decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to a million decline in digital mammography systems revenues principally due to product mix as we sold a greater number of defeatured selenia systems  which have lower average selling prices than our full featured models  a shift to a higher level of international sales  and to a lesser extent  we experienced slight pressure on average selling prices 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in the number of units sold of our new d d dimensions systems 
the decline in revenue is also due to phasing out the supply of digital detectors to an oem and closing our aeg organic photoconductor drum coatings manufacturing operations in shanghai  which in aggregate accounted for million in revenues in fiscal these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in revenues due to higher volumes of our breast biopsy products  offset in part by a slight reduction in average selling prices for these products 
we also generated million in revenues from sales of mri breast coils through our acquisition of sentinelle medical in the fourth quarter of fiscal diagnostics product sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to an increase in sales of our cervista hpv tests  and to a lesser extent other molecular tests 
partially offsetting these increases 
table of contents was a decrease in thinprep pap test volume domestically due to the decline in doctor visits  which we believe is attributable to the lagging effects of unemployment  continuing economic uncertainty and recent changes in cervical cancer screening guidelines to extend the recommended intervals between such screenings  and the discontinuance of certain molecular asrs  which contributed million of revenue in in addition  we have seen laboratory consolidation  which impacts our average selling prices due to volume purchase discounts to the larger laboratories 
gyn surgical product sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to growing sales of the adiana system  which was approved by the fda in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and to a lesser extent  an increase in the number of novasure products sold 
we also experienced a slight increase in the novasure system average selling prices 
skeletal health product sales decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to a decrease in mini c arms sales of million as a result of a reduction in the number of units sold 
in addition  there was a million decrease in osteoporosis assessment product sales principally due to a decrease in the number of bone densitometry systems sold worldwide 
this product line has experienced a difficult capital equipment environment worldwide and the ongoing effects of the reduction in reimbursement for osteoporosis exams in the us in fiscal  approximately of product sales were generated in the united states  in europe  in asia  and in other international markets

service and other revenues 
years ended september  september  change amount of total revenue amount of total revenue amount service and other revenues service and other revenues are primarily comprised of revenue generated from our field service organization to provide ongoing service  installation and repair of our products 
service and other revenues increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily in our breast health business due to an increase in the number of service contracts driven by an increase in our installed base of our full field digital mammography systems 
cost of product sales 
years ended september  september  change amount of product sales amount of product sales amount cost of product sales cost of product sales amortization of intangible assets cost of product sales impairment of intangible assets product sales gross margin decreased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal primarily due to the significant intangible asset impairment charge of million recorded in fiscal 
table of contents cost of product sales 
the cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales in fiscal was compared to in fiscal cost of product sales as a percentage of product revenues increased across our business segments  except skeletal health which remained relatively flat with the prior year 
the decline in gross margin in fiscal was driven by a shift in product mix of our selenia digital mammography systems to lower margin configurations  a higher level of international sales  and a slight reduction in average selling prices in our breast health segment 
in addition  we experienced unfavorable manufacturing variances related to our adiana system and lower absorption of manufacturing costs 
cost of product sales amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets relates to acquired developed technology 
the increase in amortization in fiscal was due to the method of recognition based on the expected economic benefits of the underlying assets  and was primarily related to the intangible assets acquired in the cytyc merger in the first quarter of fiscal cost of product sales impairment of intangible assets 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal in connection with our company wide annual budgeting and strategic planning process  we determined that indicators of impairment existed in our mammosite reporting unit due to changing market conditions for the breast brachytherapy market  including downward pressure on procedure volumes due to the continuing adverse macroeconomic environment and current trends in breast cancer management  as well as competitive pricing pressures and competition from existing and alternative new technologies 
these factors resulted in lowering our financial projections for mammosite 
we performed the first step in the long lived assets impairment test and compared mammosite s forecasted undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value of its net assets  which indicated that these cash flows were insufficient to recover mammosite s carrying value 
therefore  we determined the fair value of mammosite s long lived assets  which were primarily intangible assets  using a discounted cash flow technique 
based on the fair value of the long lived assets  we recorded an impairment charge of million to developed technology in the fourth quarter of fiscal during the second quarter of fiscal  we decided to discontinue selling a certain product acquired in the third wave acquisition  which was an indicator of impairment  and therefore  we performed an impairment test 
due to the insufficient cash flows to be generated  we determined that the related asset group s fair value was de minimus and recorded an impairment charge of million comprised of developed technology of million and capitalized license fees of million 
cost of service and other revenues 
years ended september  september  change amount of service and other revenues amount of service and other revenues amount cost of service and other revenues service and other revenues gross margin improved to in fiscal from in fiscal due in part to the improved absorption of fixed service costs as a result of the continued growth of service contract revenue  primarily in the breast health business 
we have been able to convert a high percentage of our domestic installed base of full field digital mammography systems to service contracts upon the expiration of the warranty period 

table of contents operating expenses 
years ended september  september  change amount of total revenue amount of total revenue amount operating expenses research and development selling and marketing general and administrative amortization of intangible assets impairment of goodwill impairment of intangible assets litigation settlement charges  net acquired in process research and development restructuring and divestiture charges  net research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased in fiscal compared to fiscal due to an increase in clinical trial costs  primarily related to our tomosynthesis product  the addition of expenses from sentinelle medical since august  the acquisition date  compensation and benefits  and engineering programs for a number of projects for product enhancements and new products 
these increases were offset in part by a reduction of pre release production costs that were incurred in fiscal related to the adiana system that are no longer being incurred due to its fda approval and commercial release in the fourth quarter of fiscal selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to higher distributor and third party commissions  additional expenses related to recently released products  trade shows and website marketing partially offset by lower compensation and expenditures for advertising and medical education 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to higher legal fees related to increased litigation related activities  principally the ethicon and senorx lawsuits  and higher employee compensation and benefits principally due to a transition payment to the former ceo of million in the first quarter of fiscal and related continuing retention compensation  an increase in the value of our dcp  and increased bonuses  offset slightly by lower costs from the departure of certain employees that were not replaced 
in addition  transaction costs related to acquisitions are now recorded as an expense and not capitalized as part of the purchase price  increasing general and administrative expenses in fiscal the increase in general and administrative expenses was partially offset by lower fees for accounting  tax and other consulting services  lower bad debt expense  and lower charges for the write off of certain corporate related fixed assets in fiscal amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets results from customer relationships and trade names related to our acquisitions 
these intangible assets are generally being amortized over their estimated useful lives of between and years using a straight line method or  if reliably determinable  based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the assets are expected to be consumed 
impairment of goodwill 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  in connection with performing our company wide annual budgeting and forecasting process  we determined that indicators of impairment existed in 
table of contents our mammosite reporting unit and recorded intangible asset impairment charges 
the fair value of this reporting unit declined from fiscal primarily due to our reassessment of the overall market size of breast brachytherapy and a reduction in long term growth projections 
after determining the fair values of mammosite s long lived assets  other than goodwill  and writing these assets down to their fair values  we performed the step goodwill impairment test for mammosite 
as a result of this analysis  we recorded a million goodwill impairment charge 
no other reporting units were deemed to be impaired in fiscal during the first quarter of fiscal  based upon a combination of factors  including the deteriorating macro economic environment  declines in the stock market and the decline of our market capitalization significantly below the book value of our net assets  we concluded that potential goodwill impairment indicators existed as of december  as a result  we performed an interim goodwill impairment analysis as of december  step of the impairment analysis indicated that the carrying value of the net assets of certain of our reporting units  acquired in connection with the cytyc acquisition  exceeded the estimated fair value of those reporting units 
as a result  we were required to complete step of the impairment analysis to determine the amount  if any  of goodwill impairment charges 
we completed step of this analysis during the second quarter of fiscal and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of billion in the three month period ended march  refer to note intangible assets and goodwill contained in item of this annual report for more information 
impairment of intangible assets 
as noted above under cost of product sales impairment of intangible assets  we determined that the long lived assets in the mammosite reporting unit were impaired 
as a result of this analysis  we recorded a million charge to write down customer relationships and trade name intangible assets to their fair values

litigation settlement charges  net 
these charges are primarily comprised of our litigation with ethicon endo surgery  inc we had been engaged in litigation in which ethicon had alleged patent infringement by our atec biopsy system of certain of their patents  and ethicon had made similar claims of our eviva biopsy system 
on february   we entered into a settlement agreement with ethicon  and all outstanding litigation between the parties was dismissed 
in connection with the settlement agreement  we agreed to make a one time payment to ethicon of million and ongoing royalties for sales of our atec and eviva products  and ethicon agreed to pay us ongoing royalties for sales of its mammotome magnetic resonance imaging product 
acquired in process research and development expenses 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we acquired certain assets that were determined to have no future alternative use and recorded a million charge within our diagnostics segment 
restructuring and divestiture charges 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we terminated the employment of certain employees in connection with completing the sentinelle medical acquisition and recorded severance and related benefit costs of million 
the terminations occurred prior to september  during the second quarter of fiscal  we completed the sale of the capital stock of our organic photoconductor drum coating manufacturing operation in shanghai  china for a net sales price of million resulting in a loss on disposal of million

this component is recorded as a debt discount and is amortized to interest expense 
this new accounting standard was retrospectively applied to prior periods see note a contained in item of this annual report for additional information 
in addition  we incurred interest costs and the related amortization of deferred financing costs of our senior secured credit agreement 
interest expense decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to paying down the outstanding principal amounts under our senior secured credit agreement  which were fully paid off in the third quarter of this year  partially offset by higher overall interest expense on our convertible notes due to using the effective interest method to amortize the debt discount

none of these triggering events had occurred as of september  in lieu of delivery of shares of our common stock in satisfaction of our obligation upon conversion of the exchange notes  we may elect to deliver cash or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock 
if we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation solely in cash  we will deliver cash in an amount as provided in the indenture for the exchange notes 
if we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation in a combination of cash and shares of our common stock  we will deliver up to a specified dollar amount of cash per  original principal amount of exchange notes  and will settle the remainder of our conversion obligation in shares of our common stock  in each case based on the daily conversion value calculated as provided in the indenture for the exchange notes 
in addition  at any time on or prior to the th scheduled trading day prior to the maturity date of the exchange notes  we may make an irrevocable election to settle conversions of the exchange notes either solely in cash or in a combination of cash and shares of our common stock with a specified cash amount at least equal to the accreted principal amount of the exchange notes 
this net share settlement election is in our sole discretion and does not require the consent of holders of the exchange notes 
it is our current intent and policy to settle any conversion of the exchange notes as if we had elected to make the net share settlement election 
the exchange notes are our senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all of our existing and future senior unsecured debt and prior to all future subordinated debt 
the exchange notes are effectively subordinated to any future secured indebtedness to the extent of the collateral securing such indebtedness  and structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities including trade payables of our subsidiaries 

table of contents contingent earn out payments 
in connection with our acquisitions  we have incurred the obligation to make contingent earnout payments tied to performance criteria  principally revenue growth of the acquired businesses over a specified period 
in certain circumstances  such as a change of control  a portion of these obligations may be accelerated 
in addition  contractual provisions relating to these contingent earnout obligations may include covenants to operate the businesses acquired in a manner that may not otherwise be most advantageous to us 
our contingent consideration arrangements are recorded as either additional purchase price or compensation expense if continuing employment is required to receive such payments 
pursuant to asc  contingent consideration that is deemed to be part of the purchase price is recorded as a liability based on the estimated fair value of the consideration the company expects to pay to the former shareholders of the acquired business as of the acquisition date 
this liability is remeasured each reporting period with the changes in fair value recorded through a separate line item within the company s consolidated statements of operations 
increases or decreases in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities can result from changes in discount rates  and changes in the timing  probabilities and amount of revenue estimates 
contingent consideration arrangements from acquisitions completed prior to the adoption of asc effective in fiscal for us that are deemed to be part of the purchase price of the acquisition are not subject to the fair value measurement requirements of asc and are recorded as additional purchase price to goodwill 
we have an obligation to the former adiana  inc shareholders to make contingent payments tied to the achievement of milestones 
the contingent payments of up to million are based on worldwide sales of the adiana system in the first year following fda approval and on annual incremental sales growth thereafter through december  fda approval of the adiana system occurred on july   and we began accruing contingent consideration in the fourth quarter of fiscal based on the defined percentage of worldwide sales of the product 
since this contingent consideration obligation arose from an acquisition prior to the adoption of asc  the amounts accrued are recorded as additional purchase price to goodwill and the obligation is not remeasured each reporting period through the statement of operations 
the agreement includes an indemnification provision that provides for the reimbursement of qualifying legal expenses and liabilities associated with legal claims against the adiana products and intellectual property  and we have the right to offset contingent consideration payments to the adiana shareholders with these qualifying legal costs 
we have been in litigation with conceptus regarding certain intellectual property matters related to the adiana product and are recording legal fees incurred for this litigation matter described in note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report as a reduction to the accrued contingent consideration payments  which will result in a lower payment to the adiana shareholders 
we made a payment of million to the adiana shareholders in october  net of amounts withheld for the legal indemnification provision 
at september   the accrued contingent consideration obligation is million  which is net of qualifying legal costs incurred 
on october   the jury returned a verdict in the conceptus litigation matter in favor of conceptus and awarded damages in the amount of million 
this amount is included within  and may be offset against  the million accrued as of september  we also have contingent consideration obligations related to our sentinelle medical  interlace  tct and healthcome acquisitions 
pursuant to asc  contingent consideration pertaining to sentinelle medical and interlace is required to be recorded as a liability at fair value and the adjustments to fair value are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations 
in connection with the interlace acquisition  million of the initial consideration was recorded as compensation expense and paid in fiscal based on continuing employment  and no further amounts of contingent consideration will be recorded as compensation expense related to this acquisition 
contingent consideration pertaining to tct and healthcome is contingent upon future employment and is being recorded as compensation expense as it is earned over the respective service periods 
for additional information pertaining to the acquisitions  contingent consideration terms and the assumptions used to fair value contingent consideration  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report 

table of contents a summary of amounts recorded to the consolidated statement of operations in fiscal is as follows statement of operations line item sentinelle medical interlace tct healthcome total contingent consideration compensation expense contingent consideration fair value adjustments in connection with our acquisition of sentinelle medical  we have an obligation to the former stockholders to make contingent payments over a two year period of up to a maximum of million based on a multiple of incremental revenue growth during the two year period following the completion of the acquisition 
we made the first payment of million in the third quarter of fiscal  and at september   this liability is recorded at million 
in connection with our acquisition of interlace  we have an obligation to the former stockholders to make contingent payments over a two year period up to a maximum payout of million based on a multiple of incremental revenue growth during the two year period following the completion of the acquisition 
no amounts have been paid  and at september   this liability is recorded at million 
under the sale and purchase agreement for tct  million of the purchase price is deferred for one year from the date of the acquisition  and any working capital adjustment  which is currently estimated to be million collectively  the deferred installment payment is due with the million 
in addition  we have an obligation to certain of the former shareholders  based on future employment  to make contingent payments over a two year period not to exceed million less the deferred installment payment 
each of the components of the purchase price  as well as thresholds  are subject to adjustment 
at september   we have accrued million for these contingent payments 
in connection with our acquisition of healthcome  we have an obligation to the former shareholders  who remain employed  to make contingent payments up to million over three years 
at september   we have accrued million for these contingent payments

amounts represent those recorded in accrued expenses and other long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
see contingent earn out payments for a more complete description of our contingent earn out obligations 
purchase obligations primarily relate to inventory purchases  and to a lesser extent  other operating expense commitments 
pension obligations do not include our obligation under the dcp of million  which is recorded as a current liability 
the dcp benefits are generally paid out at retirement or termination of employment 
this represents a private equity investment commitment with a limited liability partnership 
the above table does not reflect our long term liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions recorded under fin codified primarily in asc  income taxes totaling million 
due to the complexity associated with tax uncertainties  we cannot reasonably make a reliable estimate of the period in which we expect to settle these non current liabilities 
see note to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report for more information on our unrecognized tax benefits 
in addition  certain of our cost method equity investments give us the option to acquire the company in the future 
since it is not possible to estimate when  or even if  we will exercise our option to acquire these companies  we have not included these future potential payments in the table above 
future liquidity considerations we expect to continue to review and evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies  and strategic alliances that we believe will complement our current or future business 
subject to the risk factors set forth in part i  item a of this annual report and the general disclaimers set forth in our special note regarding forward looking statements at the outset of this annual report  we believe that cash flow from 
table of contents operations will provide us with sufficient funds in order to fund our expected operations over the next twelve months 
our longer term liquidity is contingent upon future operating performance 
we may also require additional capital in the future to fund capital expenditures  contingent consideration obligations  acquisitions or other investments  or to repay our convertible notes and related deferred tax liabilities 
the holders of the original notes in the principal amount of billion may require us to repurchase the notes on december   and on each of december    and at a repurchase price equal to of their accreted principal amount  and the holders of the exchange notes in the principal amount of million may require us to repurchase the notes on december   december   december   december  and december  these capital requirements could be substantial 
our operating performance may also be affected by matters discussed under the above referenced risk factors as elsewhere in this report 
these risks  trends and uncertainties may also adversely affect our long term liquidity 
legal contingencies we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and claims 
in connection with these legal proceedings and claims  management periodically reviews estimates of potential costs to be incurred by us in connection with the adjudication or settlement  if any  of these proceedings 
these estimates are developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based on an analysis of potential litigation outcomes and settlement strategies 
in accordance with asc  contingencies  loss contingencies are accrued if  in the opinion of management  an adverse outcome is probable and such outcome can be reasonably estimated 
it is possible that future results for any particular quarter or annual period may be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies relating to these proceedings 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements  allowance for doubtful accounts  reserves for excess and obsolete inventories  valuations  purchase price allocations and contingent consideration related to business combinations  expected future cash flows including growth rates  discount rates  terminal values and other assumptions used to evaluate the recoverability of long lived assets and goodwill  estimated fair values of intangible assets and goodwill  amortization methods and periods  warranty reserves  certain accrued expenses  restructuring and other related charges  stock based compensation  contingent liabilities  tax reserves and recoverability of our net deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate 
any differences may have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
the following is a discussion of what we believe to be the more significant critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
inventory our inventories include material  labor and overhead  and are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
as a developer and manufacturer of high technology medical equipment  we may be exposed to a number of economic and industry factors that could result in portions of our inventory becoming either obsolete or in excess of anticipated usage 
these factors include  but are not limited to  technological changes in our markets  our ability to meet changing customer requirements  competitive pressures on products and prices  reliability and replacement of and the availability of key components from our suppliers 
our policy is to establish inventory reserves when conditions exist that suggest that our inventory may be in excess of anticipated demand or is obsolete based upon our assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions 

table of contents we regularly evaluate our ability to realize the value of our inventory based on a combination of factors including the following historical usage rates  forecasted sales or usage  product expiration or end of life dates  estimated current and future market values and new product introductions 
assumptions used in determining our estimates of future product demand may prove to be incorrect  in which case the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory would have to be adjusted in the future 
if inventory is determined to be overvalued  we would be required to record impairment charges within cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
although considerable effort is made to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant negative impact on the value of our inventory and our operating results 
when recorded  our reserves are intended to reduce the carrying value of our inventory to its net realizable value 
provisions for excess or obsolete inventory are primarily based on our estimates of forecasted net sales and service usage levels 
a significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional provisions for excess or expired inventory in the future 
we record provisions for excess or obsolete inventory as cost of product revenue 
accounts receivable reserves we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we regularly evaluate the collectability of our trade receivables based on a combination of factors  including a dialogue with the customer to determine the cause of non payment  and evaluation of the customer s current financial situation 
in the event it is determined that the customer may not be able to meet its full obligation to us  we record a specific allowance to reduce the receivable to the amount that we expect to recover given all information present 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and our assessment of the customer s current credit worthiness 
we continuously monitor collections from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates in the future 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  for example as a result of the ongoing financial and economic uncertainty or otherwise  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we also record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product and service related sales in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
these estimates are based on the specific facts and circumstances of particular orders  analysis of credit memo data and other known factors 
if the data we use to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect reserve requirements  then a change in the allowances would be made in the period in which such a determination is made and revenues in that period could be adversely affected 
business combinations we record tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations under the purchase method of accounting 
amounts paid for each acquisition are allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the dates of acquisition 
as a result of our adoption of asc in fiscal  contingent consideration  which is not deemed to be linked to continuing employment  is recorded at fair value as measured on the date of acquisition 
the value recorded is based on estimates of future financial projections under various potential scenarios  which are probability weighted as to the outcome of each scenario 
these cash flow projections are discounted with an appropriate risk adjusted rate 
quarterly until such contingent amounts are earned  the fair value of the liability is reassessed at each reporting period and adjusted as a component of operating expenses based on changes to the underlying assumptions 
the estimates used to determine the fair value of the contingent consideration liability are subject to significant judgment and actual results are likely to differ from the amounts originally recorded 

table of contents the fair value of identifiable intangible assets is based on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management 
we allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed to goodwill 
the valuation of purchased research and development represents the estimated fair value at the date of acquisition related to in process projects 
our purchased research and development represents the value of in process projects that have not yet reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future uses as of the date of acquisition 
as a result of our adoption of asc  we capitalize these assets and record them in our consolidated balance sheet 
under asc  in process research and development assets are evaluated for impairment similar to goodwill and once the project is complete  if at all  the asset is amortized over its remaining useful life 
prior to the adoption of asc  we expensed the value attributable to these in process projects at the time of acquisition 
if the projects are not successful or completed in a timely manner  we may not realize the financial benefits expected for these projects or for the acquisitions as a whole and impairments may result 
we use the income approach to determine the fair values of our purchased research and development 
this approach determines fair value by estimating the after tax cash flows attributable to an in process project over its useful life and then discounting these after tax cash flows back to a present value 
we base our revenue assumptions on estimates of relevant market sizes  expected market growth rates  expected trends in technology and expected product introductions by competitors 
in arriving at the value of the in process projects  we consider  among other factors  the in process projects stage of completion  the complexity of the work completed as of the acquisition date  the costs already incurred  the projected costs to complete  the contribution of core technologies and other acquired assets  the expected introduction date and the estimated useful life of the technology 
we base the discount rate used to arrive at a present value as of the date of acquisition on the time value of money and medical technology investment risk factors 
we believe that the estimated purchased research and development amounts so determined represent the fair value at the date of acquisition and do not exceed the amount a third party would pay for the projects 
we have also used the income approach  as described above  to determine the estimated fair value of certain other identifiable intangible assets including developed technology  customer relationships and trade names 
developed technology represents patented and unpatented technology and know how 
customer relationships represent established relationships with customers  which provide a ready channel for the sale of additional products and services 
trade names represent acquired company and product names 
for business licenses  we use a combination of the lost profits method and replacement cost method to value such assets 
business licenses allow us to conduct business in a certain country  namely china 
intangible assets and goodwill intangible assets we amortize our intangible assets that have finite lives using either the straight line method or  if reliably determinable  based on the pattern in which the economic benefit of the asset is expected to be consumed 
the economic pattern is based on undiscounted future cash flows 
amortization is recorded over the estimated useful lives ranging from to years 
we review our intangible assets subject to amortization to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life 
if the carrying value of an asset exceeds its undiscounted cash flows  we will write down the carrying value of the intangible asset to its fair value in the period identified 
in assessing fair value  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and discount rates 
if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges 
we generally calculate fair value as the present value of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the asset using a risk adjusted discount rate 
if the estimate of an intangible asset s remaining useful life is changed  we will amortize the remaining carrying value of the intangible asset prospectively over the revised remaining useful life 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  in connection with our company wide annual budgeting and strategic planning process  we determined that indicators of impairment existed in our mammosite reporting unit  which is included in the breast health reportable segment  due to changing market conditions for the brachytherapy market  including downward pressure on procedure volumes due to the continuing adverse economic environment and current trends in breast cancer management  as well as competitive pricing pressures 
table of contents and competition from existing and alternative new technologies 
these factors resulted in us lowering the financial projections for mammosite 
as a result  we performed the first step in the long lived assets impairment test pursuant to asc and compared mammosite s forecasted undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value of its net assets 
these undiscounted cash flows were insufficient to recover mammosite s carrying value 
therefore  we determined the fair value of mammosite s long lived assets  which are primarily intangible assets  using a discounted cash flow technique 
the expected future cash flows are level inputs under asc and are those expected to be generated by the market participants  discounted at an appropriate risk adjusted rate 
based on the fair value of the long lived assets  we recorded an aggregate impairment charge of million to write these intangible assets down to their fair value 
the charge was comprised of million related to developed technology  which was recorded in cost of product sales  million related to customer relationships and million related to trade names  which were recorded in impairment of intangible assets 
in addition  the company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million see below for further discussion 
goodwill we test goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if events and circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
events that would indicate impairment and trigger an interim impairment assessment include  but are not limited to current economic and market conditions  including a decline in market capitalization  a significant adverse change in legal factors  business climate or operational performance of the business  and an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 
our annual impairment test date is the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter 
in performing the test  we utilize the two step approach prescribed under asc the first step requires a comparison of the reporting unit s carrying value to its fair value 
we consider a number of factors to determine the fair value of a reporting unit  including an independent valuation to conduct this test 
the valuation is based upon expected future discounted operating cash flows of the reporting unit as well as analysis of recent sales or offerings of similar companies 
we base the discount rate on the weighted average cost of capital wacc of market participants 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we will perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying value 
we conducted our fiscal annual impairment test on the first day of the fourth quarter 
we utilized discounted cash flow dcf and market approaches to estimate the fair value of our reporting units as of june   and ultimately used the fair value determined by the dcf in making its impairment test conclusions 
we believe we have used reasonable estimates and assumptions about future revenue  cost projections  cash flows  market multiples and discount rates 
as a result of completing step  all of the reporting units had fair values exceeding their carrying values  and as such  step of the impairment test was not required 
for illustrative purposes  had the fair value of each reporting unit been lower by  each reporting unit would have still passed step of the goodwill impairment test 
we conducted our fiscal annual impairment test on the first day of the fourth quarter 
we utilized dcf and market approaches to estimate the fair value of our reporting units as of june   and believe we used reasonable estimates and assumptions about future revenue  cost projections  cash flows and market multiples 
as a result of completing step  all of the company s reporting units  except mammosite  had fair values exceeding their carrying values  and as such  step of the impairment test was not required for these reporting units 
mammosite s fair value has declined from fiscal primarily due to a reduction in its long term growth rates 
the changes in mammosite s financial projections were a result of changing market conditions for the brachytherapy market  including downward pressure on procedure volumes due to the continuing adverse economic environment and current trends in breast cancer management  as well as competitive pricing pressures and competition from existing and alternative new technologies 
the dcf calculation of fair value was positively impacted by a reduction in the discount rate to from used in the fiscal annual impairment test 

table of contents we performed the step analysis for mammosite  consistent with the procedures described above  and recorded a million goodwill impairment charge 
for illustrative purposes had the fair value of mammosite been lower  the charge would have been higher by million 
if the fair value of the company s other reporting units had been lower by  one reporting unit would have failed step requiring a step analysis 
this reporting unit is in the breast health reportable segment and had a fair value at the annual impairment measurement date that exceeded its carrying value by with goodwill of million 
the fair value of the reporting unit was determined by use of the dcf  and the key assumptions that drive the fair value in this model are the wacc  terminal values  growth rates  and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows 
if the current economic environment were to deteriorate  this would likely result in a higher wacc because market participants would require a higher rate of return 
in the dcf as the wacc increases  the fair value decreases 
the other significant factor in the dcf is our projected financial information ie  amount and timing of expected future cash flows and growth rates and if these assumptions were to be adversely impacted  this could result in a reduction of the fair value of this reporting unit 
at september   for our other reporting units with goodwill aggregating billion as of september   we believed that these reporting units were not at risk of failing step of the goodwill impairment test 
during the first quarter of fiscal  based upon a combination of factors  including the deteriorating macro economic environment  declines in the stock market and the decline of our market capitalization significantly below the book value of our net assets  we concluded that potential goodwill impairment indicators existed as of december  as a result  we performed an interim goodwill impairment analysis as of december  step of the impairment analysis indicated that the carrying value of the net assets of certain reporting units  acquired in connection with the cytyc acquisition  exceeded the estimated fair value of those reporting units 
as a result  we were required to perform step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount  if any  of goodwill impairment charges for each of the applicable reporting units 
the step analysis required us to perform a hypothetical purchase price allocation for each of these reporting units to determine the implied fair value of goodwill and to compare the implied fair value of goodwill to the recorded amount of goodwill by reporting unit 
due to the complexities and time involved in preparing the step analysis  we had not commenced the step analysis as of february   the date we filed our form q for the quarter ended december  as a result of the fact that we had not commenced the step analysis and the complexity of the analysis required to complete the step analysis  we were unable to determine that an impairment loss  in accordance with asc  was both probable and reasonably estimable at december  we completed the step analysis during our second quarter of fiscal  which resulted in an aggregate goodwill impairment charge of billion 
this impairment charge is comprised of billion for gyn surgical  million for diagnostics  and million for breast health related to our mammosite reporting unit acquired from cytyc 
we believe that our procedures and related assumptions for estimating the reporting units fair value are reasonable and consistent with the market conditions that existed at the time of the impairment test 
for illustrative purposes  had the fair values of each reporting unit for which we recorded goodwill impairment charges in the second quarter of fiscal been lower by as of december   we would have recorded an additional impairment charge of million 
based on our estimates as of december   the impact of reducing our fair value estimates for our other reporting units  for which we did not record any goodwill impairment charges  by would have had no impact on the goodwill assessment for those reporting units 
we conducted our annual impairment test as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal in order to complete the annual impairment test  we updated our interim impairment test results and performed detailed analyses estimating the fair value of most of our reporting units utilizing our fiscal forecast with updated long term growth assumptions 
for one reporting unit  we utilized the results of our interim impairment test 
pursuant to asc  we concluded that it met the required criteria to use the estimated fair value determined from its interim impairment analysis for this reporting unit because the composition of the assets and liabilities of this reporting unit had not changed significantly since the most recent fair value determination  
table of contents the most recent fair value determination resulted in a fair value that exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit by a substantial margin  and management concluded  based on an analysis of current events that had occurred and circumstances that had changed since the most recent fair value determination  that it is remote that the current fair value of the reporting unit would not exceed their carrying amounts 
as a result of completing step  all of our reporting units  except one  had a fair value exceeding their carrying value  and as such  step of the impairment test was not required for these reporting units 
for the reporting unit that failed step  we completed step and determined that an impairment charge was not required due to the fair value of the implied goodwill exceeding the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
for illustrative purposes  had the fair value of this reporting unit at june  been lower by  the company still would not have recorded any impairment charge 
the estimate of fair value requires significant judgment 
any loss resulting from an impairment test would be reflected in operating income loss in our consolidated statements of operations 
the annual impairment testing process is subjective and requires judgment at many points throughout the analysis 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
conceptus litigation 
we have ongoing litigation with conceptus regarding potential patent infringement of a conceptus patent by our adiana system 
in the first quarter of fiscal  the jury returned a verdict in favor of conceptus and awarded conceptus million in damages 
post trial motions will be filed addressing certain issues that could impact the ultimate outcome of this case 
we also expect that conceptus will seek to enjoin us from further sales of the adiana system 
a hearing on the post trial motions and injunctions request is scheduled for december  the jury verdict and any such determinations are subject to appeal by either party 
if conceptus is successful in upholding the verdict  we may be required to remove the adiana system from the market 
the jury verdict and subsequent litigation status may be an indicator of impairment for our gyn surgical reporting unit 
a reduction in the anticipated future cash flows of our gyn surgical reporting unit could result in a material impairment charge that would have an adverse impact on our operating results 
we will further evaluate this matter in the first quarter of fiscal and will perform an interim goodwill impairment analysis and a long lived asset impairment analysis  if required 
revenue recognition we generate revenue from the sale of products  primarily medical imaging systems and diagnostic and surgical disposable products  and related services  which are primarily support and maintenance services on our medical imaging systems 
in september  the fasb ratified asc update asu no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements asu 
asu amends existing revenue recognition accounting standards that are currently within the scope of asc  subtopic  which is the revenue recognition standard for multiple element arrangements 
asu provides for three significant changes to the existing multiple element revenue recognition guidance as follows removed the requirement to have objective and reliable evidence of fair value for undelivered elements in an arrangement 
this may result in more deliverables being treated as separate units of accounting 
modified the manner in which the arrangement consideration is allocated to the separately identified deliverables 
asu requires an entity to allocate revenue in an arrangement using its best estimate of selling prices esp of deliverables if a vendor does not have vendor specific objective evidence of selling price vsoe or third party evidence of selling price tpe  if vsoe is not available 
each separate unit of accounting must have a selling price  which can be based on management s estimate when there is no other means vsoe or tpe to determine the selling price of that deliverable 
the arrangement consideration is allocated based on the elements relative selling prices 

table of contents eliminated use of the residual method and requires an entity to allocate revenue using the relative selling price method  which results in the discount in the transaction being evenly allocated to the separate units of accounting 
in september  the fasb ratified asu no 
 certain revenue arrangements that include software elements asu 
asu amends the existing revenue recognition accounting standards to remove tangible products that contain software components and non software components that function together to deliver the product s essential functionality from the scope of industry specific software revenue recognition guidance 
as permitted  we elected to early adopt these new accounting standards at the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal on a prospective basis for transactions originating or materially modified on or after september  these accounting standards generally do not change the units of accounting for our revenue transactions  and most products and services qualify as separate units of accounting 
the impact of adopting these new accounting standards was not material to our financial statements for the year ended september   and if they were applied in the same manner to fiscal would not have had a material impact to revenue recorded in fiscal  or any of the interim periods therein 
we recognize product revenue upon shipment provided that there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  there are no uncertainties regarding acceptance  the sales price is fixed or determinable  no right of return exists and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
generally  our product arrangements for capital equipment sales  primarily in our breast health and skeletal health reporting segments  are multiple element arrangements  including services  such as installation and training  and multiple products 
in accordance with asc  based on the terms and conditions of the product arrangements  we believe that these services and undelivered products can be accounted for separately from the delivered product element as our delivered products have value to our customers on a stand alone basis 
accordingly  services not yet performed at the time of product shipment are deferred and recognized as revenue as such services are performed 
the relative selling price of any undelivered products is also deferred at the time of shipment and recognized as revenue when these products are delivered 
there is no customer right of return in our sales agreements 
service revenues primarily consist of amounts recorded under service and maintenance contracts and repairs not covered under warranty  installation and training  and shipping and handling costs billed to customers 
service and maintenance contract revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
other service revenues are recognized as the services are performed 
we typically determine the selling price of our products and services based on vsoe and determine vsoe based on our normal pricing and discounting practices for the specific product or service when sold on a stand alone basis 
in determining vsoe  our policy requires a substantial majority of selling prices for a product or service to be within a reasonably narrow range 
we also consider the class of customer  method of distribution  and the geographies into which our products and services are sold when determining vsoe 
we typically have had vsoe for our products and services 
if vsoe cannot be established  which may occur in instances when a product or service has not been sold separately  stand alone sales are too infrequent  or product pricing is not within a narrow range  we attempt to establish the selling price based on tpe 
tpe is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately 
when we cannot determine vsoe or tpe  we use esp in the allocation of arrangement consideration 
the objective of esp is to determine the price at which we would typically transact a stand alone sale of the product or service 
esp is determined by considering a number of factors including our pricing policies  internal costs and gross margin objectives  method of distribution  information gathered from experience in customer negotiations  market research and information  recent technological trends  competitive landscape and geographies 

table of contents some of our products have both software and non software components that function together to deliver the product s essential functionality 
prior to the adoption of asu  we had determined that except for our cad products and dimensions d d full field digital mammography products dimensions  the software element in our other products was incidental in accordance with the software revenue recognition rules and were not within the scope of the software revenue recognition rules  asc  software revenue recognition 
we had determined that given the significance of the software component s functionality to our cad systems and dimensions products  which are in the breast health segment  these products were within the scope of the software revenue recognition rules 
asc generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on their relative vsoe of fair value 
if vsoe does not exist for a delivered element  the residual method is applied in which the arrangement consideration is allocated to the undelivered elements based on vsoe with the remaining consideration recognized as revenue for the delivered elements 
for multiple element software arrangements where vsoe of fair value of post contract customer support pcs has been established  we recognize revenue using the residual method at the time all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
upon the release of the dimensions product in fiscal  we completed an evaluation of the software component in accordance with the software revenue recognition rules 
as a result  we had determined that the dimensions product contained software that was more than incidental to the product as a whole and should be accounted for under the software revenue recognition rules 
in connection with the adoption of asu  we re evaluated the appropriate revenue recognition treatment of our products and determined that the dimensions products  which have both software and non software components that function together to deliver the products essential functionality ie  it is a tangible product  are scoped out of asc  however  our cad products will continue to be subject to asc dimensions transactions entered into prior to the first quarter of fiscal will continue to be accounted for under asc under customer usage agreements  we install certain equipment for example  a thinprep processor or a thinprep imaging system at customer sites and customers commit to purchasing minimum quantities of disposable products at a stated price generally including a usage fee for the equipment over a defined contract term  which is typically between three and five years 
revenue is recognized over the term of the customer usage agreement as disposable products are delivered 
we also rent certain equipment to customers and revenue from rental agreements is recorded over the term of the rental agreements 
stock based compensation we recognize stock based compensation expense associated with the fair value of stock options and restricted stock units issued to our employees 
determining the amount of stock based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant date fair value of stock options 
we use a binomial lattice model to determine the fair value of our stock options 
we consider a number of factors to determine the fair value of stock options including the advice of an outside valuation advisor and the advisor s model 
the model requires us to make estimates of the following assumptions expected volatility we are responsible for estimating volatility and have considered a number of factors  including third party estimates  when estimating volatility 
we currently use a combination of historical and implied volatility  which is weighted based on a number of factors 
expected term we use historical employee exercise and option expiration data to estimate the expected term assumption 
we believe that this historical data is currently the best estimate of the expected term of a new option  and that generally  all of our employees exhibit similar exercise behavior 

table of contents risk free interest rate the yield on zero coupon us treasury securities for a period that is commensurate with the expected term assumption is used as the risk free interest rate 
the amount of stock based compensation expense recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
asc  stock compensation  requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
based on an analysis of historical forfeitures  we have determined a specific forfeiture rate for certain employee groups and have applied forfeiture rates ranging from to as of september  depending on the specific employee group 
this analysis is re evaluated periodically and the forfeiture rate is adjusted as necessary 
ultimately  the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that vest 
we recognized million  million and million of stock based compensation expense for employee equity awards in fiscal years  and  respectively 
as of september   there was million and million of unrecognized compensation expense related to stock options and restricted stock units  respectively  that we expect to recognize over a weighted average period of years and years  respectively 
income taxes we use the asset and liability method for accounting for income taxes 
under this method  we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the difference between financial reporting and taxes bases of our assets and liabilities 
we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when we expect the differences to reverse 
we have recognized net deferred tax liabilities of million at september  and million at september  the liabilities primarily relate to deferred taxes associated with our acquisitions and the debt discount and original issuance discount on our convertible notes 
the tax assets relate primarily net operating loss carryforwards  accruals and reserves  stock based compensation  and research credits 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
we had gross unrecognized tax benefits  including interest  of million as of september  and million as of september  at september   million represents the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that  if recognized  would result in a reduction of the company s effective tax rate 
in the next twelve months  it is reasonably possible that we will reduce our unrecognized tax benefits by million due to expiration of statute of limitations and settlements with taxing authorities  all of which would reduce our effective tax rate 
in the ordinary course of global business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision 
in our opinion  we have made adequate provisions for income taxes for all years subject to audit 
although we believe our estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
in the event our assumptions are incorrect  the differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements presentation of comprehensive income in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income  which requires an entity to present total comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
asu does not change any of the components of comprehensive income  but it eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of stockholders equity 
asu is effective for us in our first quarter of fiscal and should be applied retrospectively 
we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of asu on our consolidated financial statements 
amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in may  the fasb issued asu no 
fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss  to provide a consistent definition of fair value and ensure that the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between us gaap and international financial reporting standards 
asu changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements particularly for level fair value measurements 
asu is effective for us in our second quarter of fiscal and should be applied prospectively 
we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of asu on our consolidated financial statements 
business combinations in december  the fasb issued asu no 
 business combinations asc topic disclosure of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations 
asu requires a public entity to disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the prior year 
it also requires a description of the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported revenue and earnings 
the new disclosure will be effective for our first quarter of fiscal the adoption of asu will require additional disclosure in the event of a business combination but will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
intangibles goodwill and other in december  the fasb issued asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other asc topic 
asu modifies step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
for those reporting units  an entity is required to perform step of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
in determining whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists  an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist 
asu is effective for us in fiscal we do not believe that asu will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment 
asu allows entities to first assess qualitatively whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
if an entity believes  as a result of its qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  the quantitative two step impairment test is required  otherwise  no further testing is required 
asu is effective for us beginning in fiscal  although early adoption is permitted 
we do not believe that asu will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial instruments  other financial instruments  and derivative commodity instruments 
financial instruments consist of cash equivalents  accounts receivable  cost method equity investments  insurance contracts and related dcp liability  accounts payable and debt obligations 
except for our outstanding convertible notes  the fair value of these financial instruments approximates their carrying amount 
as of september   we have billion of principal of convertible notes outstanding  which are comprised of our original notes with a principal of billion and our exchange notes with a principal of million 
the convertible notes are recorded net of the unamortized discount on our consolidated balance sheets 
the fair value of our original notes and exchange notes as of september  was approximately billion and million  respectively 
primary market risk exposures 
our primary market risk exposure is in the areas of interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the return from cash and cash equivalents will vary as short term interest rates change 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates  however  would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
foreign currency exchange risk 
our international business is subject to risks  including  but not limited to unique economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
we conduct business worldwide and maintain sales and service offices outside the united states as well as manufacturing facilities in germany  costa rica  canada and china 
the expenses of our international offices are denominated in local currencies  except at our costa rica subsidiary  where the majority of the business is conducted in us dollars 
our international sales are denominated in a number of currencies  primarily the euro and us dollar 
fluctuations in the foreign currency rates could affect our sales  cost of goods and operating margins and could result in exchange losses 
in addition  currency devaluations can result in a loss if we hold deposits of that currency 
we believe that the operating expenses of our international subsidiaries that are incurred in local currencies will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
our operating results and certain assets and liabilities that are denominated in the euro are affected by changes in the relative strength of the us dollar against the euro 
our expenses denominated in euros are positively affected when the united states dollar strengthens against the euro and adversely affected when the united states dollar weakens 
however  we believe that the foreign currency exchange risk is not significant 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in foreign currencies that we transact in would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
during fiscal  and  we incurred net foreign exchange losses of million  million and million  respectively
