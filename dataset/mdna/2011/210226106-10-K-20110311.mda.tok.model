item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations operations overview we are primarily engaged in real estate land sales and development  reinvestment of land sales proceeds into income properties  and golf course operations 
we own approximately  acres in florida  of which approximately  are located within and form a substantial portion of the western boundary of the city of daytona beach 
our lands are well located in the central florida s interstate corridor  providing an opportunity for reasonably stable land sales in future years 
with our substantial land holdings in daytona beach  we have parcels available for the entire spectrum of real estate uses 
along with land sales  we selectively develop parcels primarily for commercial uses 
although pricing levels and changes by us and our immediate competitors can affect sales  we generally enjoy a competitive edge due to low costs associated with long time land ownership and a significant ownership position in the immediate market 
as a general policy we do not discount sales prices to accelerate land sales 
until the dramatic downturn in the national and local economies in  sales activity on company owned lands had been strong over the preceding several years 
no land sales occurred in sales during consisted of the sale of acres of land  of which fourteen acres were uplands and two acres were wetlands 
development activities on and around company owned lands continued relatively strong throughout and into with the commencement and completion of projects planned or in process before the downturn 
sales and development activities over the last several years included the sale of acres of land to florida hospital for the construction of a new hospital  which opened in july  the expansion of the daytona beach auto mall  including the opening of bmw and volkswagen dealerships during  the opening of a second office building in the cornerstone office park  continued development within the acre gateway commerce park where a  square foot industrial building was completed in early and the acre interstate commerce park  both adjacent to interstate  and the sale of approximately acres of land west of interstate on which father lopez  a private high school  was constructed and opened in august in early  the city of daytona beach police headquarters  located adjacent to gateway commerce park  was completed and occupied 
also in  construction was completed on a unit apartment complex and a medical office building  with development of a townhouse residential community on the east side of interstate continuing 
during the first quarter of  construction commenced on an upscale restaurant on a parcel adjacent to the interstate and lpga boulevard interchange  which the company sold during the fourth quarter of this restaurant facility  vince carter s  opened for business in february on the west side of interstate  development has been completed on a fire station  a hotel  and furniture row  a  square foot furniture retail store  in the interstate commerce park  along with a new elementary school which opened in august in early  groundbreaking took place on a  square foot third party developed manufacturing facility located in gateway commerce park 
occupancy of the facility is projected for the first quarter of historical sales and profits are not indicative of future results because of the unique nature of land sales and variations in the cost basis of owned land 
a significant portion of the company s profits  in any given year  is generated through relatively large commercial land sales transactions 
the process for these land sales transactions  from the time of preliminary discussions through contract negotiations  due diligence periods  and the closing  can last from several months to several years 
the trend in company profits in through  in particular profits from real estate sales during that period  followed the overall general trend of the national and local economies and the real estate markets 
the residential real estate market reached its peak in late and early  weakening thereafter with the market  hampered by the overall economy and credit crisis 
the local commercial real estate market lagged the residential market downturn by approximately two years 
the company was able to close sales contracts during  which were generated during the years of the strong real estate market 
we entered with a relatively strong contract backlog of real estate contracts 
as the economy  real estate markets  and credit markets continued to slow  several of the contracts in place did not result in 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued closings as buyers took a more conservative approach 
although there have been recent signals of improvement in the overall economy and credit markets  we do not expect a significant improvement of economic conditions  in particular the real estate market  during in  we initiated a strategy of investing in income properties utilizing the proceeds of agricultural land sales qualifying for income tax deferral through like kind exchange treatment for tax purposes 
through the end of  we had invested approximately million in twenty six income properties through this process 
with this investment base in income properties  lease revenue in excess of million is projected to be generated annually 
this income  along with income from additional net lease income property investments  is expected to decrease earnings volatility in future years and add to overall financial performance 
this has enabled us to enter into the business of building  leasing  and holding in our portfolio select income properties that are strategically located on our lands 
in the third quarter of  we were notified by barnes noble that it would be vacating its store in lakeland  florida  upon the expiration of the original lease term at the end of january the building has since been vacated by barnes noble 
the company is exploring all strategic alternatives on this  square foot property 
during  a three month short term lease with spirit halloween superstores was executed on this property  which resulted in income of  recognized over the third and fourth quarters of all remaining properties remain leased with the average remaining lease term in excess of years  excluding additional option years 
the lease on the barnes noble store in daytona beach  florida  was scheduled to expire at the end of january  excluding option years 
an amendment to the lease was executed in october which extended the lease term through january   at a current market lease rate 
no other leases have less than six years remaining on the initial lease term 
additionally  the company has entered into an agreement with holiday cvs  llc to expand its tallahassee  florida site and amend the existing triple net lease to a new year term 
the amended lease will reflect the added improvements  which are expected to be completed during the second half of at a cost approximating million 
during the fourth quarter of  rbc centura bank closed its branch in altamonte springs  florida 
the tenant is obligated on the lease and continues to make lease payments 
we currently have two self developed projects in the lease up stage 
the first project is a two building  square foot flex office space complex located within gateway commerce park 
construction of these buildings was completed in during the third quarter of  the company executed a lease with the state of florida for  square feet in the flex office space complex 
the addition of this lease will bring occupancy of the complex to slightly over 
occupancy of this space is projected to occur by the fourth quarter of  upon completion of tenant improvements 
the second property is the first phase of a acre  lot commercial complex located at the northeast corner of lpga and williamson boulevards in daytona beach  florida 
the parcel includes a  square foot class a office building 
with the exception of additional tenant improvements  which are to be made as vacant space is leased  construction of the building has been completed 
approximately of the building is under lease to two tenants  both of which commenced occupancy in the third quarter of golf operations consist of the operation of two golf courses  a clubhouse facility  and food and beverage activities within the lpga international mixed use residential community on the west side of interstate  south and east of lpga boulevard 
the champions course was designed by rees jones and the legends course was designed by arthur hills 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued prior to  golf operations revenues had grown despite an overall decline in golf course revenues in florida 
the florida golf industry has been hurt by the over building of golf courses and hurricane activity in past years 
the overall weak national and local economies led to continued losses in through extreme cold and rainy weather conditions experienced in the first quarter of  normally the strongest profitability period  also contributed to the overall weak results from golf operations in we believe that improvement in golf course operations will be a function of stronger economic conditions  increased tourist demand  a reduction in new golf course construction which has been experienced in the last several years  and most importantly  increased residential growth in lpga international and adjoining land to the west and northwest 
lpga international and nearby projects currently under development are planned to contain about  additional dwelling units 
our efforts to improve revenues and profitability have focused on providing quality products and services while maintaining consistent and stringent cost control for both golf course and food service activities 
our agricultural operations consist of growing  managing  and selling timber and hay on approximately  acres of land on the west side of daytona beach  florida 
we are currently in the process of converting a portion of our timberlands to hay production  and considering other agricultural uses 
summary of operating results a loss amounting to  equivalent to per share  was posted for the year ended december  this loss represents a substantial downturn from profits of  equivalent to per share  earned in the decrease in profitability was the result of lower profits from real estate sales  as no transactions were closed during the period  in addition to the correction of an accounting error related to the recording of land sales in the second quarter of  as discussed in note modification of an accounting treatment in the consolidated financial statements 
the correction had the effect of decreasing net income by  during s first nine months  the company had ancillary sales of sixteen acres of land generating revenues totaling  to volusia county for a road construction project 
partially offsetting the unfavorable results from real estate sales transactions was a positive variance in stock option accruals  approximating  after income tax 
we also use earnings before depreciation  amortization  and deferred taxes ebddt as a performance measure 
our strategy of investing in income properties through the deferred tax like kind exchange process produces significant amounts of depreciation and deferred taxes 
the following is the calculation of ebddt for the and fiscal years year ended december  december  net income loss add back depreciation and amortization deferred taxes earnings before depreciation  amortization  and deferred taxes ebddt is calculated by adding depreciation  amortization  and change in deferred income tax to net income  as they represent non cash charges

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued ebddt totaled  for calendar year  compared to  in the prior year 
this reduction was primarily attributable to the lower earnings during the period 
also contributing to the decreased ebddt was a  reduction in the add back for deferred taxes 
the deferred tax add back in was impacted by the deferral of gains for income tax purposes on the real estate transactions closed during the year 
partially offsetting this impact was an increased add back for deferred taxes in resulting from approximately  associated with accelerated depreciation from amended tax returns filed based on a cost segregation study performed on the company s income and golf properties

the cost and expense increase was primarily attributable to costs  including depreciation  associated with the self developed properties 
a significant portion of this increase will be offset in the future by tenant reimbursements commencing in and thereafter 
partially offsetting the rise in costs and expenses was a gain in leasing revenues 
the rise in revenues during the year was attained on increased rents from our two self developed properties  partially offset by the loss of rents from the lakeland  florida barnes noble property  which was vacated at the end of the lease term at the end of january revenues from income properties amounting to  were posted in golf operations despite improved results during each of the last three quarters of  harsh weather conditions  including record cold and rain experienced during the first quarter of the year  resulted in increased losses from golf operations for calendar year when compared to the prior year

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued when compared to the prior year  interest and other income declined to  with interest and other income of  earned in this decrease was the result of lower investment interest earned on decreased investment securities  lower interest earned on mortgage notes receivable due to the non accrual of interest on delinquent notes  and decreased interest on funds held for reinvestment through the like kind exchange process 
general and administrative expenses rose significantly in to  compared to  in increased stock option accruals accounted for  of the increase 
this variance resulted from a significant decrease in the price of company stock during also contributing to the higher expenses were approximately  of legal and other costs associated with a shareholder lawsuit and proxy contest 
liquidity and capital resources cash and investment securities totaled  at december   in line with the balances totaling  one year earlier 
there were no funds being held for reinvestment through the like kind exchange process at either date 
the company s notes payable increased  during the year with a balance of  outstanding at year end major uses of funds during the period were centered on land acquisition and development activities 
the company reinvested approximately  on the acquisition of acres of land through internal revenue code section involuntary conversion under threat of condemnation tax deferral provisions 
we plan to reinvest an additional  in future years through this process  including the scheduled purchase of acres of land for approximately  and the acquisition of land and leasehold improvements to be made at the cvs store in tallahassee  florida approximating  development activities during the year included the continuation of the hay conversion program and the completion and approval of the comprehensive plan amendments on approximately  acres of the company s westerly lands  which provides significantly improved residential and commercial entitlements

additional capital expenditures projected for consist of approximately  for continuation of the hay conversion program and  for tenant improvements at our self developed flex office space in gateway commerce center 
additional funds are expected to be expended on tenant improvements on our self developed income properties and the recently vacated property in lakeland  florida  as leases are secured 
other than the committed tenant improvements  capital expenditures can be reduced at our discretion based on operating cash needs 
as additional funds become available through qualified sales  we expect to reinvest in additional real estate opportunities 
capital to fund the planned expenditures in is expected to be provided from cash  operating activities  and financing sources that are currently in place  including the revolving line of credit 
additionally  the company has a portfolio of investment securities which totaled  at december   and primarily 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued consists of debt securities issued by states and political subdivisions of states with varying maturities 
these investment securities can be utilized  as they mature  for capital requirements 
it is the company s intention to hold the investments to maturity 
we also believe that we have the ability  if needed  to borrow on a non recourse basis against our existing income properties  which are all free of debt as of the date of this filing 
on march   the company entered into an amendment to its credit agreement with suntrust bank as the lender with respect to its line of credit 
the line of credit is unsecured with a maximum loan amount of  a maturity date of march   and an interest rate of basis points over the month london interbank offer rate

there was a balance of  outstanding on the line of credit at december  during the fourth quarter of  our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase shares of our common stock having an aggregate value of up to  the authorization permits us to effect the repurchases from time to time through a variety of methods  including open market repurchases and privately negotiated transactions 
the repurchase plan is intended to be funded through reduced dividend payments in the future 
we have no plans to increase debt to fund the repurchase plan 
through march    shares had been repurchased at a total cost of  with no repurchases occurring during our board of directors and management continually review the allocation of any excess capital with the goal of providing the highest long term return for all shareholders 
the reviews consider various alternatives  including increasing or decreasing regular dividends  declaring special dividends  repurchasing stock  and retaining funds for reinvestment  including road development and hay conversion of timber lands 
the board of directors has reaffirmed its support for the stated business plan of reinvesting agricultural land sales proceeds into tax deferred income producing properties  self development of income properties  and the creation of infrastructure and entitlements on company lands to increase long term shareholder value 
contractual obligations and commitments we have various contractual obligations which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
other items  such as certain development obligations  are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements  but are required to be disclosed 
the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments on an undiscounted basis at december   and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies the profit on sales of real estate is accounted for in accordance with the provisions of the accounting for sales of real estate topic of fasb asc 
we recognize revenue from the sale of real estate at the time the sale is consummated unless the property is sold on a deferred payment plan and the initial payment does not meet established criteria or we retain continuing involvement with the property 
a majority of our land sales contracts contain an anti speculation clause 
this clause requires the buyer to begin construction of their project within a specified period of time 
if this requirement is not met  we have the right  but not the obligation  to repurchase the property at its original sales price 
during  a real estate transaction closed in which the company had a commitment to fund up to  for its share of road construction costs 
during  the company s revised projected cost participation  amounting to  was paid 
the remaining balance  totaling  is recorded as a liability on the balance sheet at december  this amount is subject to true up based on the actual cost of construction and an adjustment will be recorded as income upon the final true up 
we acquire income properties with long term leases in place 
upon acquisition  the portion of the purchase price which represents the market value associated with the lease is allocated to an intangible asset 
the amount of the intangible asset represents the cost of replacing the tenant should the lease be discontinued 
factors such as vacancy period  tenant improvements  and lease commissions  among others  are considered in calculating the intangible asset 
the intangible asset is amortized over the remaining life of the lease at the time of acquisition 
at december   the intangible asset associated with the income properties totaled  net of amortization of  at december  and  the intangible assets totaled  and  respectively 
these amounts were net of amortization of  and  for and  respectively 
in accordance with the accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets topic of fasb asc  we have reviewed the recoverability of long lived assets  including real estate development  income properties  and other property  plant  and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may or may not be recoverable 
examples of situations considered to be triggering events include a substantial decline in operating cash flows during the period  a current or projected loss from operations  an income property not fully leased or leased at rates that are less than current market rates  and any other quantitative or qualitative events deemed significant by our management 
long lived assets are evaluated for impairment by using an undiscounted cash flow approach  which considers future estimated capital expenditures 
impairment on long lived assets is measured at fair value by estimating discounted future operating cash flow and sales price  less cost to sell 
there has been no impairment of long lived assets reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
at the time our debt was refinanced in  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement 
this swap arrangement changes the variable rate cash flow exposure on the debt obligations to fixed cash flows so that we can manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from interest rate risk 
this swap arrangement essentially creates the equivalent of fixed rate debt 
the above referenced transaction is accounted for under the accounting for derivative instruments and certain hedging activities topic of fasb asc 
the accounting requires the derivative to be recognized on the balance sheet at its fair value and the changes in fair value to be accounted for as other comprehensive income or loss 
we measure the ineffectiveness of the interest rate swap derivative by comparing the present value of the cumulative change in the expected future cash flows on the variable leg of the swap with the present value of the cumulative change in the expected future interest cash flows on the floating rate liability 
this measure resulted 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued in no ineffectiveness for the three years ended december  a liability in the amount of  and  at december  and  respectively  has been established on our balance sheet

at the annual meeting of shareholders of the company held on april   the company s shareholders approved the consolidated tomoka land co 
equity incentive plan the plan 
the plan is intended to replace the company s stock option plan 
awards under the plan may be in the form of stock options  stock appreciation rights  restricted shares  restricted share units  performance shares  and performance units 
employees of the company and its subsidiaries and non employee directors may be selected by the compensation committee to receive awards under the plan 
the maximum number of shares as to which stock awards may be granted under the plan is  shares 
no participant may receive awards during any one calendar year representing more than  shares of common stock 
in no event will the number of shares of common stock issued under the plan upon the exercise of incentive stock options exceed  shares 
these limits are subject to adjustments by the committee as provided in the plan for stock splits  stock dividends  recapitalizations  and other similar transactions or events 
the plan will terminate on the tenth anniversary of the date that it was adopted by the board  and no awards will be granted under the plan after that date 
under the plan  the company has granted to certain key employees non vested restricted stock where vesting is based upon the achievement of certain market conditions  which are defined as the company s total shareholder return as compared to the total shareholder return of certain peer groups during a five year performance period 
during   non vested restricted shares were granted to employees 
the company uses a monte carlo simulation pricing model to determine the fair value of its market condition awards 
the determination of the fair value of market condition based awards is affected by the stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of other variables 
these variables include expected stock price volatility over the requisite performance term of awards  the relative performance of the company s stock price and shareholder returns to those companies in its peer group annual dividends and a risk free interest rate assumption 
compensation cost is recognized regardless of the achievement of the market condition  provided the requisite service period is met 
we also maintain a stock option plan pursuant to which  shares of our common stock may be issued 
this plan the plan was approved at the april  shareholders meeting 
under the plan  the option exercise price equals the stock market price on the date of grant 
the options generally vest over five years and all expire after ten years 
the plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options  which satisfy the requirements of internal revenue code irc section  and non qualified options  which are not entitled to favorable tax treatment under irc section no optionee may exercise incentive stock options in any calendar year for shares of common stock having a total market value of more than  on the date of grant subject to certain carryover provisions 
in connection with the grant of non qualified options  a stock appreciation right for each share covered by the option may also be granted 
the stock appreciation right will entitle the optionee to receive a supplemental payment  which may be paid in whole or in part in cash or in shares of common stock  equal to a portion of the spread between the exercise price and the fair market value of the underlying shares at the time of exercise 
all options granted to date have been non qualified options 
there were no stock options or stock appreciation rights granted under the plan in

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the principal market risk ie  the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices to which we are exposed is interest rates 
the objective of our asset management activities is to provide an adequate level of liquidity to fund operations and capital expansion  while minimizing market risk 
we utilize overnight sweep accounts and short term investments to minimize the interest rate risk 
we do not actively invest or trade in equity securities 
we do not believe that its interest rate risk related to cash equivalents and short term investments is material due to the nature of the investments 
we manage our debt  considering investment opportunities and risk  tax consequences  and overall financial strategies 
we are primarily exposed to interest rate risk on our   outstanding at december  long term mortgage 
the borrowing bears a variable rate of interest based on market rates 
management s objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower the overall borrowing costs 
to achieve this objective  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement during the second quarter of a hypothetical change in the interest rate of basis points ie would not materially affect our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows
