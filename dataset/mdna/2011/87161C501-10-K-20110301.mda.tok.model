significant accomplishments continued to present numerous challenges  including continuing high levels of credit losses  a changing and challenging regulatory environment that included the passage of the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank  and evolving industry capital standards

in february  synovus received national customer service excellence awards from the greenwich associates excellence in middle market and small business banking program  including recognition in the categories of overall satisfaction  relationship manager performance  personal banking branch satisfaction and customer service 
synovus management believes that these accomplishments  along with the continuing improvement in our credit metrics  better position synovus to return to profitability during business development overview synovus has traditionally focused on a strategy that includes expanding and diversifying its franchise in terms of revenues  profitability and asset size while maintaining a community banking  relationship based approach to banking 
this strategy has encompassed both organic growth and acquisitions of complementary banks and financial businesses 
during the s and through  synovus growth resulted largely from acquisitions of smaller community banks 
as a result of the economic crisis that began in  synovus has refocused its efforts on initiatives to increase revenue through organic growth  lower its cost structure  strengthen its balance sheet and capital position and aggressively reduce non performing assets 
strategic plan since the economic crisis  synovus  like many financial institutions  has continued to face a number of challenges 
these challenges include the deterioration in the commercial real estate cre market and synovus high concentration of its loan portfolio in cre  specifically in markets that have been severely impacted particularly the atlanta and florida markets 
in addition  the increased level of regulation of financial institutions as a result of the dodd frank act and other regulatory initiatives has added pressure on capital requirements and fee income growth and increased compliance costs 
following the consolidation of its subsidiary banks into a single georgia state chartered bank the charter consolidation  synovus undertook an extensive review of its current revenue sources  operations and cost structure to identify opportunities for expense reduction  streamlining of processes and opportunities for long term growth 
as part of this process  synovus considered published forecasted economic projections of low to moderate gross domestic product gdp and projected continued high unemployment rate over the next two years as well as synovus own internal forecasts regarding loan growth  credit costs  deposit trends  revenues and expenses within the southeastern markets we serve 
synovus also

table of contents lending activities overview the primary goal of synovus lending function is to help clients achieve their financial goals by providing quality loan products that are fair to the client and profitable to synovus 
management believes that this purpose can best be accomplished by building strong  profitable client relationships over time and maintaining a strong presence and position of influence in the communities synovus serves 
synovus strives to serve all of its customers with the highest levels of courtesy  respect  gratitude and fairness and deliver its services with unparalleled expertise  efficiency  responsiveness and accuracy 
this relationship based approach to banking enables synovus bankers to develop a deep knowledge of synovus customers and the markets in which they operate 
synovus has recently taken and continues to take steps to improve the consistency of its lending processes across all of its banking divisions  to strengthen the underwriting criteria it employs to evaluate new loans and loans renewals  and to diversify its loan portfolio in terms of type  industry and geographical concentration 
synovus believes that these measures will better position it to meet the credit needs of businesses and consumers in the markets it serves while pursuing a balanced strategy of loan profitability  loan growth and loan quality 
synovus conducts the majority of its lending activities within the framework of its relationship based approach to banking built on creating long term relationships with its customers

the results of synovus lending activities and the relative risk of synovus loan portfolio are discussed in part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this report 
underwriting approach recognizing that its loan portfolio is the primary source of revenue  synovus management believes that proper and consistent loan underwriting throughout synovus banking divisions is critical to synovus long term financial success 
synovus underwriting approach is designed to effectively govern the degree of assumed risk and ensure that its credit relationships conform to synovus overall risk philosophy 
throughout and  synovus has transitioned its underwriting standards and key underwriting functions from a decentralized bank by bank approach to a more centralized regional approach and  finally  to a centralized organization wide approach with the completion of its charter consolidation 
all of synovus banking divisions now utilize the same loan policy and underwriting standards 
these underwriting standards address collateral requirements  guarantor requirements including policies on financial statement  tax return  and limited guarantees  requirements regarding appraisals and their review  loan approval hierarchy  standard consumer and small business credit scoring underwriting criteria including credit score thresholds  maximum maturity and amortization  loan to value limits  global service coverage  and debt to income limits  commercial real estate and c i underwriting guidelines including minimum debt service coverage ratio  maximum amortization  minimum equity requirements  maximum loan to value ratios  lending limits  and credit approval authorities 
additionally  synovus has implemented an enhanced loan concentration policy to limit and manage its exposure to certain loan concentrations  including commercial real estate 
the enhanced loan concentration policy provides a more detailed program for portfolio risk management and reporting including limits on commercial real estate loans as a percentage of risk based capital in the aggregate and by loan type  large borrower concentration limits and monitoring  as well as portfolio mix monitoring 
synovus underwriting process is structured to require increased oversight that is proportional to the size and complexity of the lending relationship 

table of contents synovus utilizes a tiered credit approval process requiring larger loans to be approved by more senior bank officers as well as an independent senior credit officer  with the largest loans requiring approval of synovus bank s loan committee 
the centralized underwriting policy and philosophy also provides a more structured  and generally more conservative  approach to lending 
for instance  loan to value limits on certain credits are now lower than regulatory requirements  large borrower concentration limits are now more explicit and lower than prior limits  and individual lending limits are also lower than before 
furthermore  beginning in  synovus established across all of its banking divisions more stringent underwriting requirements on certain types of commercial real estate lending  including loans for the purpose of financing shopping centers and hotels 
prior to these initiatives  each of our banking divisions had its own underwriting standards 
while these separate underwriting standards were generally similar to each other and were all in compliance with regulatory requirements  the transition to uniform underwriting standards emphasizes a one company view of our operating structure and promotes greater consistency throughout synovus underwriting process 
commercial and industrial c i loan portfolio the c i loan portfolio represents the largest category of synovus total loan portfolio 
synovus c i loan portfolio is currently concentrated on small to middle market commercial and industrial lending disbursed throughout a diverse group of industries in the southeast  including health care  finance and insurance  manufacturing  construction  real estate leasing and retail trade 
the portfolio is relationship focused and  as a result  synovus lenders have in depth knowledge of the borrowers  most of which have guaranty arrangements 
c i loans are primarily originated through synovus local market banking divisions and made to commercial customers primarily to finance capital expenditures  including real property  plant and equipment  or as a source of working capital 
at december   approximately of synovus total c i loans represented loans for the purpose of financing owner occupied properties 
the primary source of repayment on these c i loans is revenue generated from products or services offered by the borrower s business 
the secondary source of repayment on these c i loans is the real estate securing such loans 
in accordance with synovus uniform lending policy  each loan undergoes a detailed underwriting process  which incorporates the uniform underwriting approach  procedures and evaluations described above 
approximately of synovus c i loans are secured by real estate  business equipment  inventory  and other types of collateral 
total c i loans at december  were billion  or  of the total loan portfolio 
c i lending is a key component of synovus growth plans 
synovus has actively invested in additional expertise  product offerings and product quality to provide its c i clients with increased and enhanced product offerings and more knowledgeable customer service 
complementing this investment in c i growth  synovus management continues to focus on streamlining and enhancing synovus existing product lines  especially for traditional retail  small business and professional services customers 
while lending to small and mid sized businesses has been synovus traditional focus  synovus has recently formed a 
table of contents large corporate banking team to provide lending solutions to larger corporate clients in an effort to strengthen  diversify and further drive growth in synovus c i loan portfolio 
commercial real estate loan portfolio synovus commercial real estate loans consist of investment property loans  residential construction and development loans  land acquisition loans  and family perm mini perm loans 
as is the case with synovus c i loans  the commercial real estate loans are primarily originated through synovus bank s local market banking divisions 
total commercial real estate loans as of december  were billion  or  of the total loan portfolio 
investment property loans synovus investment property loans are primarily made to finance multi family properties  hotels  office buildings  shopping centers  warehouses and other commercial development properties 
synovus investment property portfolio is well diversified with no concentration by property type  geography or tenants 
these loans are generally recourse in nature with short term maturities years or less  allowing for restructuring opportunities which reduces synovus overall risk exposure 
the investment property loans are primarily secured by the property being financed by the loans  however  they may also be secured by real estate or other assets beyond the property being financed 
investment property loans are subject to the same uniform lending policies and procedures described above  although such loans have historically been underwritten with stressed interest rates and vacancies 
in addition  in early  synovus placed restrictions on both hotel and shopping center lending to prevent problem loans in these depressed sectors from spreading 
these lending restrictions remain in place today 
during the fourth quarter of  synovus began quarterly reviews of all investment property loans of million or more in order to more closely monitor the performance of the portfolio 
total investment property loans as of december  were billion  or  of the total commercial real estate loan portfolio 
residential construction and development and land acquisition loans the residential construction and development loans and land acquisition loans are almost always secured by the underlying property being financed by such loans 
these properties are primarily located in the markets served by synovus 
given the recent turmoil in the housing and real estate markets  including falling real estate prices and increasing foreclosures  synovus has actively and successfully reduced its exposure to residential construction and development and land acquisition loans over the past three years  including its exposure to the atlanta market 
these loans are generally subject to the same uniform lending policies and procedures described above 
land acquisition loans have a maximum loan to value limit which is aligned with regulatory requirements 
synovus has tightened the maximum loan to value limit for residential construction and development loans to levels more stringent than the current regulatory guidelines 
at december   these loans were billion  or  of the total commercial real estate loan portfolio  compared to billion or of the total commercial real estate portfolio at december  
table of contents family perm mini perm loans family perm mini perm loans are almost always secured by the underlying property being financed by such loans 
these properties are primarily located in the markets served by synovus 
these loans are subject to the same uniform lending policies and procedures described above 
additionally  underwriting standards for these types of loans include stricter approval requirements as well as more stringent underwriting standards than current regulatory guidelines 
at december   these loans totaled billion  or of the total commercial real estate portfolio 
retail loan portfolio synovus retail loan portfolio consists of a wide variety of loan products offered through its banking network  including residential mortgages  home equity lines  credit card loans  and other retail loans 
these various types of secured and unsecured retail loans are marketed to qualifying existing clients and to other creditworthy candidates in synovus market area 
the majority of synovus retail loans are consumer mortgages secured by first and second liens on residential real estate primarily located in the markets served by synovus in georgia  florida  south carolina  alabama  and tennessee 
retail loans are subject to the same uniform lending policies and procedures described above and consist primarily of loans with strong credit scores  conservative debt to income ratios  and loan to value ratios based upon prudent guidelines to ensure consistency with synovus overall risk philosophy 
total retail loans as of december  were billion  or  of the total loan portfolio 
mortgage banking synovus wholly owned subsidiary  synovus mortgage corp 
synovus mortgage  originates residential mortgage loans with originations totaling billion in synovus mortgage offers various types of fixed and adjustable rate loans for the purposes of purchasing  refinancing or constructing residential properties 
the originated loans are primarily conforming mortgage loans for owner occupied properties 
conforming loans are loans that are underwritten in accordance with the underwriting standards set forth by government sponsored entities such as the federal national mortgage association and the federal home loan mortgage corporation 
these are generally collateralized by one to four family residential real estate properties and are made to borrowers in good credit standing 
substantially all of the mortgage loans originated by synovus mortgage are sold to third party purchasers servicing released  without recourse or continuing involvement 
each purchaser of our mortgage loans has specific guidelines and criteria for sellers of loans  and the risk of credit loss with regard to the principal amount of the loans sold is generally transferred to the purchasers upon sale 
while the loans are sold without recourse  the purchase agreements require synovus mortgage to make certain representations and warranties regarding the existence and sufficiency of file documentation and the absence of fraud by borrowers or other third parties such as appraisers in connection with obtaining the loan 
if it is determined that the loans sold were in breach of these representations or warranties  synovus mortgage has obligations to either repurchase the loan for the unpaid principal balance and related investor fees or make the purchaser whole for the economic benefits of the loan

other loans held for sale portfolio with the exception of certain first lien residential mortgage loans  synovus originates loans with the intent to hold those loans to maturity 
loans or pools of distressed loans are transferred to the other loans held for sale portfolio when the intent to hold the loans has changed due to portfolio management or risk mitigation strategies and there is a plan to sell the loans within a reasonable period of time  and the individual loans are specifically identified 
the value of the loans or pools of loans is primarily determined by analyzing the underlying collateral of the loan and the anticipated external market prices of similar assets 
at the time of transfer  if the fair value less estimated costs to sell is less than the carrying amount  as such difference generally attributable to declines in credit quality  it is recorded as a charge off against the allowance for loan losses 
at december  the carrying value of other loans held for sale was million 
credit quality synovus continuously monitors credit quality and maintains an allowance for loan losses that its management believes is sufficient to absorb probable and estimable losses inherent in its loan portfolio 
throughout the last two years  synovus took  and continues to take  an aggressive approach to address problem assets and reduce future exposures through an accelerated asset disposition strategy as well as aggressive recognition of expected losses on problem loans 
for a more detailed discussion of synovus credit quality please refer to the section titled credit quality under part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this report 
monitoring of collateral our loan portfolio and the collateral securing such loans is predominately in our five state market consisting of georgia  florida  south carolina  alabama  and tennessee 
commercial and industrial c i loans represent of the total loan portfolio at december  these loans are predominately secured by owner occupied and other real estate 
other types of collateral securing these loans consist primarily of marketable equipment  marketable inventory  accounts receivable  equity and debt securities  and time deposits 
total commercial real estate loans represent of the total loan portfolio at december  these loans are primarily secured by commercial real estate  including family properties  land  and investment properties 
the collateral generally consists of the property being financed by the loans  however  collateral may also include real estate or other assets beyond the property being financed 
retail loans at december  totaled billion  or  of the total loan portfolio 
of this amount  billion consists of consumer 
table of contents mortgages secured by first and second liens on residential real estate 
credit card loans represent million of this amount and these loans are unsecured 
other retail loans represent million of this amount  and they are primarily secured by collateral consisting of marketable securities  automobiles  time deposits  and cash surrender value of life insurance 
synovus follows a risk based approach as it relates to the credit monitoring processes for its loan portfolio 
synovus obtains updates of the fair value of the real estate collateral securing collateral dependent impaired loans each calendar quarter 
the fair value of the real estate securing these loans is generally determined based upon appraisals performed by a certified or licensed appraiser 
management also considers other factors or recent developments  such as selling costs and anticipated sales values considering management s plans for disposition  which could result in adjustments to the collateral value estimates indicated in the appraisals 
synovus updates the values of collateral that is in the form of accounts receivable  inventory  equipment  and cash surrender value of life insurance policies at least annually and the values of collateral that is in the form of marketable securities and brokerage accounts at least monthly 
for credits that are not on impaired status  synovus generally obtains a third party appraisal of the value of the real estate collateral prior to each loan renewal 
additionally  if conditions warrant eg  loans that are not considered impaired but exhibit a higher or potentially higher risk  synovus engages a third party to reappraise the value of the collateral on a more frequent basis 
examples of circumstances that could warrant a new appraisal on an existing performing credit include instances where local market conditions where the real estate collateral is located have deteriorated  the collateral has experienced damage fire  wind damage  etc  the lease or sell out of the collateral has not met the original projections  and the net operating income of the collateral has declined 
in circumstances where the collateral is no longer considered sufficient  synovus seeks to obtain additional collateral 
loan guarantees in addition to collateral  synovus generally requires a guarantee from all principals on all commercial real estate and c i lending relationships 
specifically  synovus generally obtains unlimited guarantees from any entity eg  individual  corporation  or partnership that owns or controls percent or more of the borrowing entity 
limited guarantees on a pro rata basis are generally required for all percent or more owners 
synovus evaluates the financial ability of a guarantor through an evaluation of the guarantor s current financial statements  income tax returns for the two most recent years  as well as financial information regarding a guarantor s business or related interests 
in addition  synovus analyzes substantial assets owned by the guarantor to ensure that the guarantor has the necessary ownership or control over these assets 
for loans that are not considered impaired  the allowance for loan losses is determined based on the risk rating of each loan 
the risk rating incorporates a number of factors  including guarantors 
if a loan is rated doubtful  with certain limited exceptions  a guarantee is not considered in determining the amount to be charged off ie  the charge off equals the greater of the amount of the collateral 
table of contents exposure or of the loan balance  in compliance with regulatory requirements 
with the exception of certain loans whose amount is inconsequential  all impaired loans are collateral dependent 
the charge off on these loans is determined based upon the amount of the collateral exposure only 
with certain limited exceptions  synovus seeks performance under guarantees in the event of a borrower s default 
however  under the current economic environment  and based on the fact that a majority of our problem credits are commercial real estate credits  our success in recovering amounts due under guarantees has been limited 
unsecured loans at december   synovus had unsecured loans totaling approximately billion  which represents approximately of total loans 
this segment of our portfolio includes million in credit card loans and approximately million in commercial loans to borrowers that are primarily in the manufacturing  insurance  financial services  utilities  and religious organization sectors 
provision and allowance for loan losses despite credit standards  internal controls  and a continuous loan review process  the inherent risk in the lending process results in periodic charge offs 
the provision for losses on loans is the charge to operating earnings necessary to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses 
through the provision for losses on loans  synovus maintains an allowance for losses on loans that management believes is adequate to absorb probable losses within the loan portfolio 
however  future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions  as well as changes in assumptions regarding a borrower s ability to pay and or collateral values 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination procedures  periodically review synovus bank s allowance for loan losses 
based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination  such agencies may require synovus bank to recognize additions to its allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is a significant estimate and is regularly evaluated by synovus for adequacy 
to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  a formal analysis is completed quarterly to assess the probable loss within the loan portfolio 
this assessment  conducted by lending officers  as well as an independent credit review function  contains significant judgment and includes analyses of historical performance including the level of charge offs  past due trends  the level of non performing loans  reviews of certain impaired loans  review of collateral values  loan activity since the previous quarter  consideration of current economic conditions  and other pertinent information 
each loan is assigned a rating  either individually or as part of a homogeneous pool  based on an internally developed risk rating system 
the resulting conclusions are reviewed and approved by senior management 
the process for determining the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses and  accordingly  the amount of the provisions that should be made to that allowance during each period  is based upon a number of assumptions  estimates  and judgments that are inherently subjective and subject to change 

table of contents see provision and allowance for loan losses section of part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this report for a more detailed discussion of synovus provision and allowance for loan losses 
non performing assets and past due loans non performing assets consist of loans classified as non accrual  impaired loans held for sale and real estate acquired through foreclosure 
synovus management continuously monitors non performing and past due loans to prevent further deterioration regarding the condition of these loans 
in order to reduce non performing asset levels  synovus has aggressively disposed of non performing loans over the last two years 
while synovus still has a material amount of non performing assets  synovus total non performing assets at december  were at their lowest level in the last two years 
see the non performing assets and past due loans section of part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this report for a more detailed discussion of synovus non performing assets and past due loans 
investment activities our investment securities portfolio consists principally of debt and equity securities classified as available for sale 
investment securities available for sale provide synovus with a source of liquidity and a relatively stable source of income 
the investment securities portfolio also provides management with a tool to balance the interest rate risk of its loan and deposit portfolios 
our investment strategy focuses on the use of the investment securities portfolio to manage the interest rate risk created by the inherent mismatch between the loan and deposit portfolios 
synovus also utilizes a significant portion of its investment portfolio to secure certain deposits and other liabilities requiring collateralization 
at december   approximately billion of these investment securities were pledged as required collateral for certain deposits  securities sold under repurchase agreements  and federal home loan bank fhlb advances 
as such  the investment securities are primarily us government agency debentures  us treasury notes  and government agency sponsored mortgage backed securities  all of which have a high degree of liquidity and limited credit risk 
a mortgage backed security depends on the underlying pool of mortgage loans to provide a cash flow pass through of principal and interest 
at december   all of the collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage backed pass through securities held by synovus were issued or backed by federal agencies 
synovus also holds state and municipal securities and limited equity securities 

table of contents funding activities liquidity represents the extent to which synovus has readily available sources of funding to meet the needs of depositors  borrowers  and creditors  to support asset growth  to maintain reserve requirements  and to otherwise sustain operations of synovus and its subsidiary  synovus bank  at a reasonable cost on a timely basis and without adverse consequences 
deposits represent the largest source of funds for lending and investing activities 
scheduled payments  as well as prepayments  and maturities from our loan and investment portfolios also provide a stable source of funds 
additional funding sources which provide sources of liquidity include fhlb bank advances  brokered deposits and other short term borrowed funds  as well as through equity and debt issued through the capital markets  including our recent public offerings 
synovus asset liability management committee alco  operating under liquidity and funding policies approved by the board of directors  actively analyzes contractual and anticipated cash flows in order to properly manage synovus liquidity position

deposits deposits provide the most significant funding source for synovus interest earning assets  and remain a strength of synovus business 
deposits are attracted principally from clients within synovus retail branch network through the offering of a broad array of deposit products to individuals and businesses  including non interest bearing demand deposit accounts  interest bearing demand deposit accounts  savings accounts  money market deposit accounts  and time deposit accounts 
synovus also utilizes national market brokered deposits as a funding source in addition to deposits attracted through its retail branch network 
terms vary among deposit products with respect to commitment periods  minimum balances  and applicable fees 
interest paid on deposits represents the largest component of synovus interest expense 
interest rates offered on interest bearing deposits are determined based on a number of factors  including  but not limited to  interest rates offered in local markets by competitors  current and expected economic conditions  anticipated future interest rates  the expected amount and timing of funding needs  and the availability and cost of alternative funding sources 
client deposits are attractive sources of funding because of their stability and relative cost 
deposits are regarded as an important part of the overall client relationship and provide opportunities to cross sell other synovus services

borrowed funds and non deposit liquidity synovus ability to borrow funds from non deposit sources provides additional flexibility in meeting the liquidity needs of synovus 
synovus generates non deposit liquidity through maturities and repayments of loans by customers and access to sources of funds other than deposits 
synovus bank has the capacity to access funding through its membership in the fhlb 
at december   synovus bank had access to incremental funding  subject to available collateral and fhlb credit policies  through utilization of fhlb advances 
in addition to bank level liquidity management  synovus must manage liquidity at the holding company level for various operating needs including capital infusions into subsidiaries  the servicing of debt  the payment of general corporate expenses  and the payment of dividends to shareholders 
the primary source of liquidity for synovus has historically consisted of dividends from synovus bank  which is governed by certain rules and regulations of various state and federal banking regulatory agencies 
synovus has historically enjoyed a solid reputation and credit standing in the capital markets and in the past few years has relied on the capital markets to provide needed liquidity resources  including its public 
table of contents offerings completed in september and may despite the success of these recent public offerings  given synovus recent financial performance and related credit ratings  there can be no assurance that synovus would be able to obtain new borrowings or issue additional equity on favorable terms  if at all 
see part i item a 
risk factors of this report 
additionally  synovus does not expect to receive dividends from synovus bank in the near future  and may be required to contribute additional capital to synovus bank  which could adversely affect liquidity and cause it to raise funds on terms that are unfavorable 
competition the financial services industry is highly competitive and could become more competitive as a result of recent and ongoing legislative  regulatory and technological changes  and continued consolidation and economic turmoil within the financial services industry 
the ability of nonbanking financial institutions to provide services previously limited to commercial banks also has intensified competition 
our bank subsidiary and wholly owned non bank subsidiaries compete actively with national and state banks  savings and loan associations and credit unions and other nonbank financial institutions  including securities brokers and dealers  investment advisory firms  mortgage companies  insurance companies  trust companies  finance companies  leasing companies  mortgage companies and certain governmental agencies  all of which actively engage in marketing various types of loans  deposit accounts and other financial services 
these competitors have been successful in developing products that are in direct competition with or are alternatives to the banking services offered by traditional banking institutions 
our ability to deliver strong financial performance will depend in part on our ability to expand the scope of  and effectively deliver  products and services  which will allow us to meet the changing needs of our customers 
as of december   we were the second largest bank holding company headquartered in georgia  based on assets 
customers for financial services are generally influenced by convenience  quality of service  personal contacts  price of services and availability of products 
although our market share varies in different markets  we believe that our community focused relationship banking approach enables us to compete effectively with other banks and thrifts in their relevant market areas 
employees as of december   we had  employees compared to approximately  employees at december  supervision  regulation and other factors like all bank holding companies and financial holding companies  we are regulated extensively under federal and state law 
in addition  our bank subsidiary synovus bank and certain of our non bank subsidiaries are subject to regulation under federal and state law 
the following discussion sets forth some of the elements of the bank regulatory framework applicable to us and certain of our subsidiaries 
the regulatory framework is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the deposit insurance fund and not for the 
table of contents protection of security holders and creditors 
to the extent that the following information describes statutory and regulatory provisions  it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provisions 
general bank holding companies and financial holding companies are subject to supervision and regulation by the board of governors of the federal reserve system under the bank holding company act 
in addition  the georgia department of banking and finance regulates holding companies that own georgia charted banks under the bank holding company laws of the state of georgia 
synovus bank  which is not a member of the federal reserve system  is subject to primary regulation and examination by the federal deposit insurance corporation  which we refer to as the fdic  and by its state banking regulator  the georgia department of banking and finance 
numerous other federal and state laws  as well as regulations promulgated by the federal reserve board  the state banking regulator and the fdic govern almost all aspects of the operations of synovus bank 
synovus trust company  a subsidiary of synovus bank that provides trust services  is organized as a national bank and thus is subject to regulation and supervision by the office of the comptroller of the currency 
various federal and state bodies regulate and supervise our non bank subsidiaries including our brokerage  investment advisory  insurance agency and processing operations 
these include  but are not limited to  the sec  the financial industry regulatory authority  federal and state banking regulators and various state regulators of insurance and brokerage activities 
permitted activities under the bank holding company act  a bank holding company is generally permitted to engage in  or acquire direct or indirect control of more than percent of the voting shares of  any company engaged in the following activities banking or managing or controlling banks  furnishing services to or performing services for our subsidiaries  and any activity that the federal reserve board determines to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident to the business of banking  including factoring accounts receivable  making  acquiring  brokering or servicing loans and usual related activities  leasing personal or real property  operating a non bank depository institution  such as a savings association  performing trust company functions  providing financial and investment advisory activities  conducting discount securities brokerage activities  underwriting and dealing in government obligations and money market instruments  
table of contents providing specified management consulting and counseling activities  performing selected data processing services and support services  acting as agent or broker in selling credit life insurance and other types of insurance in connection with credit transactions  and performing selected insurance underwriting activities 
the federal reserve board has the authority to order a bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any of these activities or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary when it has reasonable cause to believe that the bank holding company s continued ownership  activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety  soundness or stability of it or any of its bank subsidiaries 
under the bank holding company act  a bank holding company may file an election with the federal reserve board to be treated as a financial holding company and engage in an expanded list of financial activities 
the election must be accompanied by a certification that the company s insured depository institution subsidiary is well capitalized and well managed 
additionally  the community reinvestment act of rating of our subsidiary bank must be satisfactory or better 
we have made such an election and are treated as a financial holding company 
as such  we may engage in activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to financial activities  including insurance underwriting  securities underwriting and dealing  and making merchant banking investments in commercial and financial companies 
if our banking subsidiary ceases to be well capitalized or well managed under applicable regulatory standards  the federal reserve board may  among other things  place limitations on our ability to conduct these broader financial activities or  if the deficiencies persist  require us to divest the banking subsidiary 
in addition  if our banking subsidiary receives a rating of less than satisfactory under the community reinvestment act  we would be prohibited from engaging in any additional activities other than those permissible for bank holding companies that are not financial holding companies 
if  after becoming a financial holding company and undertaking activities not permissible for a bank holding company  the company fails to continue to meet any of the prerequisites for financial holding company status  including those described above  the company must enter into an agreement with the federal reserve board to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements 
if the company does not return to compliance within days  the federal reserve may order the company to divest its subsidiary bank or the company may discontinue or divest investments in companies engaged in  activities permissible only for a bank holding company that has elected to be treated as a financial holding company 
actions by federal and state regulators like all bank and financial holding companies  we are regulated extensively under federal and state law 
under federal and state laws and regulations pertaining to the safety and soundness of insured depository institutions  state banking regulators  the federal reserve  and separately the fdic as the insurer of bank deposits  have the authority to compel or restrict certain actions on our part if they determine that we have insufficient capital or are 
table of contents otherwise operating in a manner that may be deemed to be inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices 
under this authority  our bank regulators can require us to enter into informal or formal supervisory agreements  including board resolutions  memoranda of understanding  written agreements and consent or cease and desist orders  pursuant to which we would be required to take identified corrective actions to address cited concerns and to refrain from taking certain actions 
as a result of losses that we have incurred to date and our high level of credit losses and non performing assets  we entered into a memorandum of understanding with the federal reserve bank of atlanta and the banking commissioner of the state of georgia  or the georgia commissioner  pursuant to which we agreed to implement plans that are intended to  among other things  minimize credit losses and reduce the amount of our problem assets  limit and manage our concentrations in commercial loans  improve our credit risk management and related policies and procedures  address liquidity management and current and future capital requirements  strengthen enterprise risk management practices  and provide for succession planning for key corporate and regional management positions and our board of directors 
the memorandum of understanding also requires that we inform and consult with the federal reserve board prior to declaring and paying any future dividends  and obtain the prior approval of the federal reserve bank of atlanta and the georgia commissioner prior to increasing the quarterly cash dividend on our common stock above per share 
in addition  synovus bank is presently subject to a memorandum of understanding with the georgia commissioner and the fdic that is substantially similar in substance and scope to the holding company memorandum of understanding described above 
the bank memorandum of understanding also requires that synovus bank obtain approval from the georgia commissioner and the fdic prior to paying any cash dividends to synovus and provides that  as a result of our charter consolidation  we will take all necessary steps to avoid customer confusion as a result of our proposed use of trade names at our various bank branches and to update our long term strategic plan to reflect the charter consolidation and the various actions we have otherwise agreed to implement under the memorandum of understanding 
synovus bank is presently also subject to a memorandum of understanding with the georgia commissioner and the fdic relating to its subsidiary  synovus mortgage 
in the synovus mortgage memorandum of understanding  synovus bank has agreed to implement plans that are intended to  among other things  ensure appropriate oversight of synovus mortgage and synovus mortgage s compliance program relating to compliance and fair lending laws  rules and regulations 
if we are unable to comply with the terms of our current supervisory agreements  or if we become subject to and are unable to comply with the terms of any future regulatory actions or directives  supervisory agreements  or orders  then we could become subject to additional  heightened supervisory actions and orders  possibly including consent orders  prompt corrective action restrictions and or other regulatory actions  including prohibitions on the payment of dividends on our common stock and series a preferred stock 
if our regulators were to take such additional supervisory actions  then we could  among other things  become subject to significant restrictions on our ability to develop any new business  as well as 
table of contents restrictions on our existing business  and we could be required to raise additional capital  dispose of certain assets and liabilities within a prescribed period of time  or both 
the terms of any such supervisory action could have a material negative effect on our business  reputation  operating flexibility  financial condition  and the value of our common stock 
see part i item a 
risk factors we presently are subject to  and in the future may become subject to  additional supervisory actions and or enhanced regulation that could have a material negative effect on our business  reputation  operating flexibility  financial condition and the value of our common stock of this report 
change in control subject to certain exceptions  the bank holding company act and the change in bank control act  together with regulations promulgated thereunder  require federal reserve board approval prior to any person or company acquiring control of a bank or bank holding company 
control is conclusively presumed to exist if an individual or company acquires percent or more of any class of voting securities  and rebuttably presumed to exist if a person acquires percent or more  but less than percent  of any class of voting securities and either the company has registered securities under section of the exchange act or no other person owns a greater percentage of that class of voting securities immediately after the transaction 
in certain cases  a company may also be presumed to have control under the bank holding company act if it acquires percent or more of any class of voting securities 
our common stock is registered under section of the exchange act 
on september   the federal reserve board issued a policy statement on minority equity investments in banks and bank holding companies  that permits investors to acquire up to percent of the total equity of a target bank or bank holding company  subject to certain conditions  including but not limited to that the investing firm does not acquire percent or more of any class of voting securities  and designate at least one director  without triggering the various regulatory requirements associated with control 
standards for safety and soundness the federal deposit insurance act requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to prescribe  by regulation or guideline  operational and managerial standards for all insured depository institutions relating to internal controls  information systems and audit systems  loan documentation  credit underwriting  interest rate risk exposure  and asset quality 
the agencies also must prescribe standards for asset quality  earnings  and stock valuation  as well as standards for compensation  fees and benefits 
the federal banking agencies have adopted regulations and interagency guidelines prescribing standards for safety and soundness to implement these required standards 
these guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards used to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired 
under the regulations  if a regulator determines that a bank fails to meet any standards prescribed by the guidelines  the regulator may require 
table of contents the bank to submit an acceptable plan to achieve compliance  consistent with deadlines for the submission and review of such safety and soundness compliance plans 
dividends synovus is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries 
under the laws of the state of georgia  we  as a business corporation  may declare and pay dividends in cash or property unless the payment or declaration would be contrary to restrictions contained in our articles of incorporation  or unless  after payment of the dividend  we would not be able to pay our debts when they become due in the usual course of our business or our total assets would be less than the sum of our total liabilities 
in addition  we are also subject to federal regulatory capital requirements that effectively limit the amount of cash dividends  if any that we may pay 
under the federal reserve board guidance reissued on february  the federal reserve may restrict our ability to pay dividends on any class of capital stock or any other tier capital instrument if we are not deemed to have a strong capital position 
in addition  we may have to reduce or eliminate dividends if our net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters  net of dividends previously paid during that period  is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends  our prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with the holding company s capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition  or we will not meet  or are in danger of not meeting  the minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios 
on november   the federal reserve board issued further guidance noting  among other things  that bank holding companies should consult with the federal reserve before taking any actions that could result in a diminished capital bases  including increasing dividends 
as a result of the memorandum of understanding described in item a 
risk factors we are presently subject to  and in the future may become subject to additional  supervisory actions and or enhanced regulation that could have a material negative effect on our business  operating flexibility  financial condition and the value of our common stock in this report  we are required to inform the federal reserve board in advance of declaring or paying any future dividends  and the federal reserve board could decide at any time that paying any common stock dividends could be an unsafe or unsound banking practice 
in the current financial and economic environment  the federal reserve board has indicated that bank holding companies should carefully review their dividend policy and has in some cases discouraged payment unless both asset quality and capital are very strong 
in addition  pursuant to the terms of the synovus bank memorandum of understanding  synovus bank cannot pay any cash dividends without the approval of the fdic and the georgia commissioner 

table of contents additionally  we are subject to contractual restrictions that limit our ability to pay dividends if there is an event of default under such contract 
finally  so long as any of our debt or equity securities issued to the united stated department of the treasury the treasury under its capital purchase program capital purchase program are held by the treasury  synovus will not be permitted to increase the dividend rate on our common stock without approval from the treasury 
see tarp regulations capital purchase program below 
the primary sources of funds for our payment of dividends to our shareholders are cash on hand and dividends from our bank and non bank subsidiaries 
various federal and state statutory provisions and regulations limit the amount of dividends that synovus bank and our non banking subsidiaries may pay 
synovus bank is a georgia bank 
under the regulations of the georgia department of banking and finance  a georgia bank must have approval of the georgia department of banking and finance to pay cash dividends if  at the time of such payment the ratio of tier capital to adjusted total assets is less than percent  the aggregate amount of dividends to be declared or anticipated to be declared during the current calendar year exceeds percent of its net after tax profits for the previous calendar year  or its total classified assets in its most recent regulatory examination exceeded percent of its tier capital plus its allowance for loan losses  as reflected in the examination 
the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution  including payment of a dividend  or paying any management fee to its holding company if the institution would thereafter be undercapitalized 
in addition  federal banking regulations applicable to us and our bank subsidiary require minimum levels of capital that limit the amounts available for payment of dividends 
in addition  many regulators have a policy  but not a requirement  that a dividend payment should not exceed net income to date in the current year 
finally  the ability of banks and bank holding companies to pay dividends  and the contents of their respective dividend policies  could be impacted by a range of changes imposed by the dodd frank act  many of which will require implementing rules to become effective

table of contents capital we are required to comply with the capital adequacy standards established by the federal reserve board and our bank subsidiary must comply with similar capital adequacy standards established by the fdic 
as a financial holding company  we and our bank subsidiary are required to maintain capital levels required for a well capitalized institution  as defined in prompt corrective action below 
our capital requirements the federal reserve board adopted guidelines pursuant to which it assesses the adequacy of capital in examining and supervising a bank holding company or financial holding company and in analyzing applications to it under the bank holding company act 
these guidelines include quantitative measures that assign risk weightings to assets and off balance sheet items and that define and set minimum regulatory capital requirements 
all bank holding companies are required to maintain tier capital of at least percent of risk weighted assets and off balance sheet items  total capital the sum of tier capital and tier capital of at least percent of risk weighted assets and off balance sheet items and tier capital of at least percent of adjusted quarterly average assets 
tier capital consists principally of shareholders equity less any amounts of goodwill  other intangible assets  interest only strips receivables  deferred tax assets  non financial equity investments  and other items that are required to be deducted by the federal reserve board 
tier capital consists principally of perpetual and trust preferred stock that is not eligible to be included as tier capital  term subordinated debt  intermediate term preferred stock and  subject to limitations  general allowances for loan and lease losses 
assets are adjusted under the risk based guidelines to take into account different risk characteristics 
average assets for this purpose do not include goodwill and any other intangible assets and investments that the federal reserve board determines should be deducted from tier capital 
this regulatory capital framework is expected to change in important respects as a result of the dodd frank act and a separate  international regulatory capital initiative known as basel iii 
in particular  the current risk based capital guidelines that apply to synovus and its subsidiary bank are based upon the capital accord of the basel committee on banking supervision bcbs  a committee of central banks and bank supervisors 
the basel i standards to which us banks and bank and financial holding companies are subject were implemented by the federal reserve 
in  the federal reserve began to phase in capital standards based on the bcbs second capital accord  referred to as basel ii  for large or core international banks total assets of billion or more or consolidated foreign exposures of billion or more 
basel ii emphasizes internal assessment of credit  market and operational risk  as well as supervisory assessment and market discipline in determining minimum capital requirements 
in december  bcbs finalized new regulatory capital standards  known as basel iii 
these standards  which are aimed at capital reform  seek to further strengthen financial institutions capital positions by mandating a higher minimum level of common equity to be held  along with a capital conservation buffer to withstand future 
table of contents periods of stress 
the basel iii regime does not supplant basel ii  however 
the basel ii requirements focus on the appropriate allocation of capital to bank assets based on credit risk 
basel iii addresses the quality of capital and introduces new capital requirements but does not purport to overrule the credit risk based standards of basel ii 
as of december   our tier common equity is in excess of the minimum common equity and additional conservation buffer stipulated by these newly proposed requirements 
regardless  complying with these new capital requirements will likely affect our operations  and the extent to which we will be affected will be known with more certainty once additional clarity is provided on the underlying details of these new requirements 
these new requirements have been endorsed by the us banking regulators  but have not yet been translated by the regulators into official regulation for us financial institutions 
it is anticipated that the regulators will adopt new regulatory capital requirements similar to those proposed by the bcbs  and the new requirements are anticipated to be phased in for us financial institutions beginning in it is widely anticipated that the capital requirements for most bank and financial holding companies  as well as for most insured depository institutions  will increase  although the nature and amounts of the increase have not yet been specified 
synovus bank s capital requirements to be well capitalized  synovus bank must generally maintain a total capital the sum of tier capital and tier capital ratio of percent or greater  a tier capital ratio of percent or greater  and a leverage ratio of percent or greater 
for the purposes of these tests  tier capital consists of common equity  retained earnings and a limited amount of qualifying preferred stock  less goodwill and certain core deposit intangibles 
tier capital consists of non qualifying preferred stock  certain types of debt and the eligible portion of the allowance for loan losses 
in measuring the adequacy of capital  assets are weighted for risk at rates that generally range from zero percent to percent 
certain assets  such as most cash instruments and us treasury securities  have a zero risk weighting 
others  such as certain commercial and consumer loans  have a percent risk weighting 
risk weightings are also assigned for off balance sheet items such as unfunded loan commitments 
the various items are multiplied by the appropriate risk weighting to determine risk adjusted assets for the capital calculations 
for the leverage ratio mentioned above  assets are not risk weighted 

table of contents capital ratios certain regulatory capital ratios for synovus and synovus bank as of december  are shown in the following table 
table capital ratios as of december  regulatory minimums regulatory minimums to be well capitalized synovus synovus bank tier capital ratio total risk based capital ratio leverage ratio synovus bank entered into a memorandum of understanding with the fdic and the georgia department of banking and finance following the charter consolidation and has agreed to maintain minimum capital ratios at specified levels higher than those otherwise required by applicable regulation as follows tier capital to total average assets leverage ratio and total capital to risk weighted assets total risk based capital ratio

prompt corrective action for undercapitalization the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act established a system of prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of undercapitalized insured depository institutions 
under this system  the federal banking regulators are required to rate insured depository institutions on the basis of five capital categories as described below 
the federal banking regulators are also required to take mandatory supervisory actions and are authorized to take other discretionary actions  with respect to insured depository institutions in the three undercapitalized categories  the severity of which will depend upon the capital category in which the insured depository institution is assigned 
generally  subject to a narrow exception  the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act requires the banking regulator to appoint a receiver or conservator for an insured depository institution that is critically undercapitalized 
the federal banking agencies have specified by regulation the relevant capital level for each category 
under the regulations  all insured depository institutions are assigned to one of the following capital categories well capitalized the insured depository institution exceeds the required minimum level for each relevant capital measure 
a well capitalized insured depository 
table of contents institution is one having a total risk based capital ratio of percent or greater  having a tier risk based capital ratio of percent or greater  having a leverage capital ratio of percent or greater  and that is not subject to any order or written directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure 
adequately capitalized the insured depository institution meets the required minimum level for each relevant capital measure 
an adequately capitalized insured depository institution is one having a total risk based capital ratio of percent or greater  having a tier risk based capital ratio of or greater  and having a leverage capital ratio of percent or greater or a leverage capital ratio of percent or greater if the institution is rated composite under the camels capital  assets  management  earnings  liquidity and sensitivity to market risk rating system 
undercapitalized the insured depository institution fails to meet the required minimum level for any relevant capital measure 
an undercapitalized insured depository institution is one having a total risk based capital ratio of less than percent  having a tier risk based capital ratio of less than percent  or a leverage capital ratio of less than percent  or if the institution is rated a composite under the camels rating system  a leverage capital ratio of less than percent 
significantly undercapitalized the insured depository institution is significantly below the required minimum level for any relevant capital measure 
a significantly undercapitalized insured depository institution is one having a total risk based capital ratio of less than percent  a tier risk based capital ratio of less than percent  or a leverage capital ratio of less than percent 
critically undercapitalized the insured depository institution fails to meet a critical capital level set by the appropriate federal banking agency 
a critically undercapitalized institution is one having a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than percent 
the regulations permit the appropriate federal banking regulator to downgrade an institution to the next lower category if the regulator determines after notice and opportunity for hearing or response  that the institution is in an unsafe or unsound condition or that the institution has received and not corrected a less than satisfactory rating for any of the categories of asset quality  management  earnings or liquidity in its most recent examination 
supervisory actions by the appropriate federal banking regulator depend upon an institution s classification within the five categories 
our management believes that we and our bank subsidiary have the requisite capital levels to qualify as well capitalized institutions under the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act regulations 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item of this report 
the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution  including payment of a dividend  or paying any management fee to its holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized 
see dividends 
undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to restrictions on borrowing from the federal reserve system 
in addition  
table of contents undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit capital restoration plans 
a depository institution s holding company must guarantee the capital plan  up to an amount equal to the lesser of percent of the depository institution s assets at the time it becomes undercapitalized or the amount of the capital deficiency when the institution fails to comply with the plan 
federal banking agencies may not accept a capital plan without determining  among other things  that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution s capital 
if a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan  it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized 
significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions  including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized  requirements to reduce total assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks 
critically undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to appointment of a receiver or conservator 
if an institution fails to remain well capitalized  it will be subject to a variety of enforcement remedies that increase as the capital condition worsens 
for instance  federal law generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution  including the payment of a dividend or paying any management fee to its holding company  if the depository institution would be undercapitalized as a result 
undercapitalized depository institutions may not accept brokered deposits absent a waiver from the fdic  are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit a capital restoration plan for approval  which must be guaranteed by the institution s holding company 
significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions  including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized  requirements to reduce total assets  and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks 
critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator 
deposit insurance and assessments deposits at our banks are insured by the deposit insurance fund as administered by the fdic  up to the applicable limits established by law 
in february  the fdic adopted a long term deposit insurance fund dif restoration plan as well as an additional emergency assessment for the restoration plan increases base assessment rates for banks in all risk categories with the goal of raising the dif reserve ratio from its current 
to within seven years 
banks in the best risk category paid initial base rates ranging from to basis points of assessable deposits beginning april  additionally  the fdic adopted a final rule imposing a special emergency assessment on all financial institutions of basis points of total assets minus tier capital as of june  our special emergency assessment totaled million and was paid on september  the fdic is also permitted to impose an emergency special assessment after june  of up to basis points if necessary to maintain public confidence in federal deposit insurance 
the fdic has not to date imposed such an assessment 
the increase in assessments by the fdic could have a material adverse effect on 
table of contents our earnings 
in addition  the fdic collects the financing corporation fico deposit assessments on assessable deposits 
fico assessments are set quarterly  and in ranged from annual basis points in the first quarter to annual basis points in the second  third and fourth quarters 
our subsidiary bank pays the deposit insurance assessment  less any offset available by means of assessment credits  and pay the quarterly fico assessments 
effective november  and until december   the fdic expanded deposit insurance limits for certain accounts under the temporary liquidity guarantee program 
provided an institution has not opted out of the program  the fdic would fully guarantee funds deposited in non interest bearing transaction accounts  including i interest on lawyer trust accounts  or iolta accounts  and ii negotiable order of withdrawal  or now accounts  with rates no higher than percent through june  and no higher than percent after june  if the institution has committed to maintain the interest rate at or below that rate 
in conjunction with the increased deposit insurance coverage  insurance assessments also increased 
in addition  the dodd frank act provides temporary  unlimited deposit insurance for all noninterest bearing transaction accounts 
in january  the fdic s issued final rules implementing this provision of the dodd frank act by including ioltas within the definition of a noninterest bearing transaction account 
per the fdic s final rules  all funds held in iolta accounts  together with all other noninterest bearing transaction account deposits  are fully insured  without limit  from december   through december  on november   the fdic imposed a requirement on all financial institutions to prepay three years of fdic insurance premiums 
on december   synovus prepaid million of fdic insurance premiums for the next three years 
on december   synovus prepaid fdic insurance premiums totaled approximately million  representing estimated insurance premiums for the next two years 
the dodd frank act directs the fdic to amend its regulations to re define the method of calculation of an insured depository institution s insurance fund assessment  changing the calculation from being based on domestic deposits to one that is based on asset size 
specifically  the dodd frank act requires the assessment base to be an amount equal to the average consolidated total assets of the insured depository institution during the assessment period  minus the sum of the average tangible equity of the insured depository institution during the assessment period and an amount the fdic determines is necessary to establish assessments consistent with the risk based assessment system found in the federal deposit insurance act 
the fdic has issued final rules outlining this new insurance assessment methodology  which will impact the amount of synovus bank s insurance assessment 
with respect to brokered deposits  an insured depository institution must be well capitalized in order to accept  renew or roll over such deposits without fdic clearance 
an adequately capitalized insured depository institution must obtain a waiver from the fdic in order to accept  renew or roll over brokered deposits 
undercapitalized insured depository institutions generally may not accept  renew or roll over brokered deposits

table of contents dodd frank act  future changes to legal framework on july   president obama signed into law the dodd frank act  which will substantially change the regulatory framework under which we operate over the next several years 
the dodd frank act represents a significant overhaul of many aspects of the regulation of the financial services industry  addressing  among other things  systemic risk  capital adequacy  deposit insurance assessments  consumer financial protection  interchange fees  derivatives  lending limits  mortgage lending practices  registration of investment advisors and changes among the bank regulatory agencies 
among the provisions that may affect the operations of synovus or synovus bank are the following creation of the bureau of consumer financial protection with centralized authority for consumer protection in the banking industry 
new limitations on federal preemption 
application of new regulatory capital requirements  including changes to leverage and risk based capital standards and changes to the components of permissible tiered capital 
requirement that the company and its subsidiary bank be well capitalized and well managed in order to engage in activities permitted for financial holding companies 
changes to the assessment base for deposit insurance premiums 
making permanent the  limit for federal deposit insurance and provide unlimited insurance coverage for noninterest bearing demand transaction accounts 
repeal of the prohibition on the payment of interest on demand deposits  effective july   thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts 
restrictions on compensation  including a prohibition on incentive based compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk by taking covered financial institutions and are deemed to be excessive  or that may lead to material losses 
some of these and other major changes could materially impact the profitability of our business  the value of assets we hold or the collateral available for our loans  require changes to business practices or force us to discontinue businesses and expose us to additional costs  taxes  liabilities  enforcement actions and reputational risk 
many of these provisions became effective upon enactment of the dodd frank act  while others are subject to further study  rule making  and the discretion of regulatory bodies 
we cannot predict the effect that compliance with the dodd frank act or any implementing regulations will have on synovus businesses or its ability to pursue future business opportunities 
additional regulations resulting from the dodd frank act may materially adversely affect synovus business  financial condition or results of operations 
see part item a 
risk factors regulation of the financial services industry is undergoing major changes  and future legislation could increase our cost of doing business or harm our competitive position of this report 

table of contents additional changes to the laws and regulations applicable to us are frequently proposed at both the federal and state levels 
the likelihood  timing  and scope of any such change and the impact any such change may have on us are impossible to determine with any certainty 
consumer protection regulations retail activities of banks are subject to a variety of statutes and regulations designed to protect consumers 
interest and other charges collected or contracted for by banks are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates 
loan operations are also subject to federal laws applicable to credit transactions  such as the federal truth in lending act and regulation z issued by the federal reserve board  governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers  the home mortgage disclosure act and regulation c issued by the federal reserve board  requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves  the equal credit opportunity act and regulation b issued by the federal reserve board  prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race  creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit  the fair credit reporting act and regulation v issued by the federal reserve board  governing the use and provision of information to consumer reporting agencies  the fair debt collection act  governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies  and the guidance of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such federal laws 
deposit operations also are subject to the truth in savings act and regulation dd issued by the federal reserve board  which requires disclosure of deposit terms to consumers  regulation cc issued by the federal reserve board  which relates to the availability of deposit funds to consumers  the right to financial privacy act  which imposes a duty to maintain the confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records  and the electronic funds transfer act and regulation e issued by the federal reserve board  which governs automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services 
the federal reserve and fdic have recently enacted consumer protection regulations related to automated overdraft payment programs offered by financial institutions 
in november  the federal reserve amended its regulation e to prohibit financial 
table of contents institutions  including synovus bank  from charging consumers fees for paying overdrafts on automated teller machine and one time debit card transactions  unless a consumer consents  or opts in  to the overdraft service for those types of transactions 
the regulation e amendments also require financial institutions to provide consumers with a notice that explains the financial institution s overdraft services  including the fees associated with the service and the consumer s choices 
the amendments to regulation e became effective on august  in november  the fdic supplemented the regulation e amendments by requiring fdic supervised institutions  including synovus bank  to implement additional changes relating to automated overdraft payment programs by july  the most significant of these changes require financial institutions to monitor overdraft payment programs for excessive or chronic customer use and undertake meaningful and effective follow up action with customers that overdraw their accounts more than six times during a rolling month period 
the additional guidance also imposes daily limits on overdraft charges  requires institutions to review and modify check clearing procedures  prominently distinguish account balances from available overdraft coverage amounts and requires increased board and management oversight regarding overdraft payment programs 
many of the foregoing laws and regulations are subject to change resulting from the provisions in the dodd frank act  which in many cases calls for revisions to implementing regulations 
in addition  oversight responsibilities of these and other consumer protection laws and regulations will  in large measure  transfer from the bank s primary regulator to the bureau of consumer financial protection 
we cannot predict the effect that being regulated by a new  additional regulatory authority focused on consumer financial protection  or any new implementing regulations or revisions to existing regulations that may result from the establishment of this new authority  will have on synovus businesses 
additional regulations resulting from the dodd frank act may materially adversely affect synovus business  financial condition or results of operations 
see part item a 
risk factors regulation of the financial services industry is undergoing major changes  and future legislation could increase our cost of doing business or harm our competitive position of this report 
in addition  our subsidiary bank may also be subject to certain state laws and regulations designed to protect consumers 
anti money laundering  usa patriot act  office of foreign assets control financial institutions must maintain anti money laundering programs that include established internal policies  procedures  and controls  a designated compliance officer  an ongoing employee training program  and testing of the program by an independent audit function 
we are prohibited from entering into specified financial transactions and account relationships and must meet enhanced standards for due diligence in dealings with foreign financial institutions and foreign customers 
we also must take reasonable steps to conduct enhanced scrutiny of account relationships to guard against money laundering and to report any suspicious transactions 
recent laws provide law enforcement authorities with increased access to financial information maintained by banks 
anti money laundering obligations have been substantially strengthened as a result of the usa patriot act  enacted in and 
table of contents renewed in bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these obligations and are required to consider compliance in connection with the regulatory review of applications 
the usa patriot act amended  in part  the bank secrecy act and provides for the facilitation of information sharing among governmental entities and financial institutions for the purpose of combating terrorism and money laundering 
the statute also creates enhanced information collection tools and enforcement mechanics for the us government  including requiring standards for verifying customer identification at account opening  promulgating rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions  regulators  and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering  requiring reports by nonfinancial trades and businesses filed with the treasury s financial crimes enforcement network for transactions exceeding  and mandating the filing of suspicious activities reports if a bank believes a customer may be violating us laws and regulations 
the statute also requires enhanced due diligence requirements for financial institutions that administer  maintain  or manage private bank accounts or correspondent accounts for non us persons 
the federal bureau of investigation may send bank regulatory agencies lists of the names of persons suspected of involvement in terrorist activities 
our banks can be requested to search their records for any relationships or transactions with persons on those lists and may be required to report any identified relationships or transactions 
furthermore  the office of foreign assets control  or ofac  is responsible for helping to ensure that us entities do not engage in transactions with certain prohibited parties  as defined by various executive orders and acts of congress 
ofac publishes  and routinely updates  lists of names of persons and organizations suspected of aiding  harboring or engaging in terrorist acts  including the specially designated nationals and blocked persons 
if we find a name on any transaction  account or wire transfer that is on an ofac list  we must freeze such account  file a suspicious activity report and notify the appropriate authorities 
commitments to subsidiary bank under the federal reserve board s policy  we are expected to serve as a source of financial strength to synovus bank and to commit resources to support synovus bank in circumstances when we might not do so absent such policy 
under the bank holding company act  the federal reserve board may require a bank holding company to terminate any activity or relinquish control of a nonbank subsidiary  other than a nonbank subsidiary of a bank  upon the federal reserve board s determination that such activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness or stability of any depository institution subsidiary 
further  the federal reserve board has discretion to require a bank holding company to divest itself of any bank or non bank subsidiaries if the agency determines that any such divestiture may aid the depository institution s financial condition 
in addition  any capital loans by us to our subsidiary bank would be subordinate in right of payment to depositors and to certain other indebtedness of the bank 
notably  the dodd frank act has codified the federal reserve s source of strength doctrine  which is scheduled to become effective in in addition to the foregoing requirements  the dodd frank act s new 
table of contents provisions authorize the federal reserve to require a company that directly or indirectly controls a bank to submit reports that are designed both to assess the ability of such company to comply with its source of strength obligations and to enforce the company s compliance with these obligations 
if we were to enter bankruptcy or become subject to the orderly liquidation process established by the dodd frank act  any commitment by us to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank would be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee or the fdic  as appropriate  and entitled to a priority of payment 
in addition  the fdic provides that any insured depository institution generally will be liable for any loss incurred by the fdic in connection with the default of  or any assistance provided by the fdic to  a commonly controlled insured depository institution 
synovus bank is an fdic insured depository institution and thus subject to these requirements 
transactions with affiliates and insiders a variety of legal limitations restrict our subsidiary bank from lending or otherwise supplying funds or in some cases transacting business with us or our non bank subsidiaries 
synovus bank is subject to sections a and b of the federal reserve act and federal reserve regulation w 
section a places limits on the amount of covered transactions which include loans or extensions of credit to  investments in or certain other transactions with  affiliates as well as the amount of advances to third parties collateralized by the securities or obligations of affiliates 
the aggregate of all covered transactions is limited to percent of the bank s capital and surplus for any one affiliate and percent for all affiliates 
furthermore  within the foregoing limitations as to amount  each covered transaction must meet specified collateral requirements ranging from to percent 
also  the bank is prohibited from purchasing low quality assets from any of its affiliates 
section b  among other things  prohibits an institution from engaging in certain transactions with affiliates unless the transactions are on terms substantially the same  or at least as favorable to the bank  as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies 
except for limitations on low quality asset purchases and transactions that are deemed to be unsafe or unsound  regulation w generally excludes affiliated depository institutions from treatment as affiliates 
transactions between a bank and any of its subsidiaries that are engaged in certain financial activities may be subject to the affiliated transaction limits 
the federal reserve board also may designate bank subsidiaries as affiliates 
banks are also subject to quantitative restrictions on extensions of credit to executive officers  directors  principal shareholders  and their related interests 
in general  such extensions of credit may not exceed certain dollar limitations  must be made on substantially the same terms  including interest rates and collateral  as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with third parties and must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features 
certain extensions of credit also require the approval of a bank s board of directors 

table of contents regulatory examinations federal and state banking agencies require us and our subsidiary bank to prepare annual reports on financial condition and to conduct an annual audit of financial affairs in compliance with minimum standards and procedures 
synovus bank  and in some cases we and our nonbank affiliates  must undergo regular on site examinations by the appropriate banking agency  which will examine for adherence to a range of legal and regulatory compliance responsibilities 
a bank regulator conducting an examination has complete access to the books and records of the examined institution 
the results of the examination are confidential 
the cost of examinations may be assessed against the examined institution as the agency deems necessary or appropriate 
community reinvestment act the community reinvestment act requires the fdic to evaluate the record of synovus bank in meeting the credit needs of its local community  including low and moderate income neighborhoods 
these evaluations are considered in evaluating mergers  acquisitions  and applications to open a branch or facility 
failure to adequately meet these criteria could result in additional requirements and limitations on the bank 
commercial real estate lending lending operations that involve concentrations of commercial real estate loans are subject to enhanced scrutiny by federal banking regulators 
the regulators have advised financial institutions of the risks posed by commercial real estate lending concentrations 
such loans generally include land development  construction loans and loans secured by multifamily property  and nonfarm  nonresidential real property where the primary source of repayment is derived from rental income associated with the property 
the guidance prescribes the following guidelines for examiners to help identify institutions that are potentially exposed to concentration risk and may warrant greater supervisory scrutiny total reported loans for construction  land development and other land represent percent or more of the institutions total capital  or total commercial real estate loans represent percent or more of the institution s total capital  and the outstanding balance of the institution s commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased by percent or more during the prior months 
in october  the federal banking agencies issued additional guidance on commercial real estate lending that emphasizes these considerations 
branching the dodd frank act substantially amended the legal framework that had previously governed interstate branching activities 
formerly  under the reigle neal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of  a bank s ability to branch into a particular state was largely dependent upon whether the state opted in to de novo interstate branching 
many states did not opt in  which resulted in branching restrictions in those states 
the dodd 
table of contents frank act removed the opt in concept and permits banks to engage in de novo branching outside of their home states  provided that the laws of the target state permit banks chartered in that state to branch within that state 
accordingly  de novo interstate branching by synovus bank is subject to these new standards 
all branching in which synovus bank may engage remains subject to regulatory approval and adherence to applicable legal and regulatory requirements 
anti tying restrictions in general  a bank may not extend credit  lease  sell property  or furnish any services or fix or vary the consideration for them on the condition that the customer obtain or provide some additional credit  property  or services from or to the bank or bank holding company or their subsidiaries  or the customer not obtain some other credit  property  or services from a competitor  except to the extent reasonable conditions are imposed to assure the soundness of the credit extended 
a bank may  however  offer combined balance products and may otherwise offer more favorable terms if a customer obtains two or more traditional bank products 
also  certain foreign transactions are exempt from the general rule 
privacy and credit reporting financial institutions are required to disclose their policies for collecting and protecting confidential customer information 
customers generally may prevent financial institutions from sharing nonpublic personal financial information with nonaffiliated third parties  with some exceptions  such as the processing of transactions requested by the consumer 
financial institutions generally may not disclose certain consumer or account information to any nonaffiliated third party for use in telemarketing  direct mail marketing or other marketing 
federal and state banking agencies have prescribed standards for maintaining the security and confidentiality of consumer information  and we are subject to such standards  as well as certain federal and state laws or standards for notifying consumers in the event of a security breach 
synovus bank utilizes credit bureau data in underwriting activities 
use of such data is regulated under the fair credit reporting act and regulation v on a uniform  nationwide basis  including credit reporting  prescreening  and sharing of information between affiliates and the use of credit data 
the fair and accurate credit transactions act  which amended the fair credit reporting act  permits states to enact identity theft laws that are not inconsistent with the conduct required by the provisions of that act 
enforcement powers synovus bank and its institution affiliated parties  including management  employees  agents  independent contractors and consultants  such as attorneys and accountants and others who participate in the conduct of the institution s affairs  are subject to potential civil and criminal penalties for violations of law  regulations or written orders of a government agency 
violations can include failure to timely file required reports  filing false or misleading information or submitting inaccurate reports 
civil penalties may be as high as  a day for such violations and criminal penalties for some financial institution crimes may 
table of contents include imprisonment for years 
regulators have flexibility to commence enforcement actions against institutions and institution affiliated parties  and the fdic has the authority to terminate deposit insurance 
when issued by a banking agency  cease and desist and similar orders may  among other things  require affirmative action to correct any harm resulting from a violation or practice  including restitution  reimbursement  indemnifications or guarantees against loss 
a financial institution may also be ordered to restrict its growth  dispose of certain assets  rescind agreements or contracts  or take other actions determined to be appropriate by the ordering agency 
the federal banking agencies also may remove a director or officer from an insured depository institution or bar them from the industry if a violation is willful or reckless 
we have entered into a memorandum of understanding with the federal reserve bank of atlanta and the banking commissioner of the state of georgia  pursuant to which we agreed to implement plans that are intended to  among other things  minimize credit losses and reduce the amount of our problem assets  limit and manage our concentrations in commercial real estate loans  improve our credit risk management and related policies and procedures  address liquidity management and current and future capital requirements  strengthen enterprise risk management practices  and provide for succession planning for key corporate and regional management positions 
additionally  synovus bank is presently subject to a memorandum of understanding with the georgia commissioner and the fdic that is substantially similar in substance and scope to the holding company memorandum of understanding described above  and synovus bank is presently also subject to a memorandum of understanding with the georgia commissioner and the fdic relating to its subsidiary  synovus mortgage

monetary policy and economic controls the earnings of our bank subsidiary  and therefore our earnings  are affected by the policies of regulatory authorities  including the monetary policy of the federal reserve board 
an important function of the federal reserve board is to promote orderly economic growth by influencing interest rates and the supply of money and credit 
among the methods that have been used to achieve this objective are open market operations in us government securities  changes in the discount rate for bank borrowings  expanded access to funds for nonbanks and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits 
these methods are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth and distribution of bank loans  investments and deposits  interest rates on loans and securities  and rates paid for deposits 
recently  in response to the financial crisis  the federal reserve board has created several innovative programs to stabilize certain financial institutions and to ensure the availability of credit 
the effects of the various federal reserve board policies on our future business and earnings cannot be predicted 
we cannot predict the nature or extent of any effects that possible future governmental controls or legislation might have on our business and earnings

tarp regulations eesa and arra under the eesa  congress has the ability to impose after the fact terms and conditions on participants in treasury s tarp capital purchase program 
as a participant in the tarp capital purchase program  we are subject to any such retroactive legislation 
on february   the treasury announced the financial stability plan under the eesa the financial stability plan which is intended to further stabilize financial institutions and stimulate lending across a broad range of economic sectors 
on february   president obama signed the arra  a broad economic stimulus package that included additional restrictions on  and potential additional regulation of  financial institutions 
on june   under the authority granted to it under arra and eesa  the treasury issued an interim final rule under section of eesa  as amended by arra  regarding compensation and corporate governance restrictions that would be imposed on tarp recipients  effective june  as a tarp recipient with currently outstanding tarp obligations  we are subject to the compensation and corporate governance restrictions and requirements set forth in the interim final rule  which  among other things prohibit us from paying or accruing bonuses  retention awards or incentive compensation  except for certain long term stock awards  to our senior executives and next most highly compensated employees  prohibit us from making severance payments to any of our senior executive officers or next five most highly compensated employees  require us to conduct semi annual risk assessments to assure that our compensation arrangements do not encourage unnecessary and excessive risks or the manipulation of earnings to increase compensation  require us to recoup or clawback any bonus  retention award or incentive compensation paid by us to a senior executive officer or any of our next most highly compensated employees  if the payment was based on financial statements or other performance criteria that are later found to be materially inaccurate  prohibit us from providing tax gross ups to any of our senior executive officers or next most highly compensated employees  require us to provide enhanced disclosure of perquisites  and the use and role of compensation consultants  required us to adopt a corporate policy on luxury and excessive expenditures  require our chief executive officer and chief financial officer to provide period certifications about our compensation practices and compliance with the interim final rule  require us to provide enhanced disclosure of the relationship between our compensation plans and the risk posed by those plans  and require us to provide an annual non binding shareholder vote  or say on pay proposal  to approve the compensation of our executives  consistent with regulations promulgated by the sec 
on january   the sec adopted final regulations setting forth the parameters for such say on pay proposals for public company tarp participants 

table of contents additional regulations applicable to tarp recipients adopted as part of eesa  the financial stability plan  arra  or other legislation may subject us to additional regulatory requirements 
the impact of these additional requirements may put us at competitive disadvantage in comparison to financial institutions that have either repaid all tarp funds or never accepted tarp funds and may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 
capital purchase program on october  the us treasury  or treasury  announced that  pursuant to the emergency economic stabilization act  it was implementing a voluntary program known as the capital purchase program  or cpp  pursuant to which eligible financial institutions could raise capital by selling preferred stock directly to the us government 
the purpose of the capital purchase program was to encourage us financial institutions to build capital to  among other things  increase the flow of financing to us businesses and consumers and support the us economy  and was also intended to prevent additional failures of financial institutions 
synovus applied for the maximum investment available under the cpp equal to of risk weighted assets  noting that this additional capital would be used to provide strength against worse than expected economic conditions  more flexibility in disposing of problem assets to strengthen our balance sheet  capacity to invest in our local economies through lending  ability to work with homeowners in mortgage workouts  and participation in government directed acquisitions of banks or assets  and  as permitted  opportunistic acquisition transactions 
our application to participate in the cpp was approved by treasury on november  on december   synovus consummated the cpp investment and issued to treasury  shares of synovus fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock  series a without par value the series a preferred stock  having a liquidation amount per share equal to  for a total price of  the series a preferred stock pays cumulative dividends at a rate of per year for the first five years and thereafter at a rate of per year 
synovus has timely paid all dividends on the series a preferred stock 
we may not redeem the series a preferred stock during the first three years except with the proceeds from a qualified equity offering 
after february   we may  at our option and with the consent of the federal deposit insurance corporation  redeem  in whole or in part  the series a preferred stock at the liquidation amount per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends 
the series a preferred stock is generally non voting 
however  if we fail to pay dividends on the series a preferred stock for an aggregate of six quarterly periods  whether or not consecutive  our number of authorized directors shall be increased by two and the holders of the series a preferred stock shall have the right to elect two directors

table of contents item a 
risk factors this section highlights the material risks that we currently face 
please be aware that these risks may change over time and other risks may prove to be important in the future 
new risks may emerge at any time  and we cannot predict such risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect our business  financial condition or results of operations or the trading price of our securities 
the current and further deterioration in the residential construction and commercial development real estate markets may lead to increased non performing assets in our loan portfolio and increased provision expense for losses on loans  which could have a material adverse effect on our capital  financial condition and results of operations 
since the third quarter of  the residential construction and commercial development real estate markets have experienced a variety of difficulties and challenging economic conditions 
our non performing assets were billion at december   compared to billion at december  and billion at december  while recent economic data suggests that overall economic conditions are improving  if market conditions remain poor or further deteriorate  they may lead to additional valuation adjustments on our loan portfolios and real estate owned as we continue to reassess the fair value of our non performing assets  the loss severities of loans in default  and the fair value of real estate owned 
we also may realize additional losses in connection with our disposition of non performing assets 
poor economic conditions could result in decreased demand for residential housing  which  in turn  could adversely affect the development and construction efforts of residential real estate developers 
consequently  such economic downturns could adversely affect the ability of such residential real estate developer borrowers to repay these loans and the value of property used as collateral for such loans 
a sustained weak economy could also result in higher levels of non performing loans in other categories  such as commercial and industrial loans  which may result in additional losses 
management continually monitors market conditions and economic factors throughout our footprint for indications of change in other markets 
if these economic conditions and market factors negatively and or disproportionately affect some of our larger loans  then we could see a sharp increase in our total net charge offs and also be required to significantly increase our allowance for loan losses 
any further increase in our non performing assets and related increases in our provision expense for losses on loans could negatively affect our business and could have a material adverse effect on our capital  financial condition and results of operations 
our allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses  and we may be required to materially increase our allowance  which may adversely affect our capital  financial condition and results of operations 
we maintain an allowance for loan losses  which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expenses  which represents management s best estimate of probable credit losses that have been incurred within the existing portfolio of loans  as described under note of notes to consolidated financial statements in this report and 
table of contents under critical accounting policies allowance for loan losses under part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this report 
the allowance  in the judgment of management  is established to reserve for estimated loan losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio 
the determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks using existing qualitative and quantitative information  all of which may undergo material changes 
changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers  new information regarding existing loans  identification of additional problem loans  risk ratings  and other factors  both within and outside of our control  may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses 
because the risk rating of the loans is inherently subjective and subject to changes in the borrower s credit risk profile  evolving local market conditions and other factors  it can be difficult for us to predict the effects that those factors will have on the classifications assigned to the loan portfolio  and thus difficult to anticipate the velocity or volume of the migration of loans through the classification process and effect on the level of the allowance for loan losses 
accordingly  we monitor our credit quality and our reserve requirements and use that as a basis for capital planning and other purposes 
see liquidity and capital resources under part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this report 
in addition  bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or the recognition of additional loan charge offs  based on judgments different than those of management 
an increase in the allowance for loan losses results in a decrease in net income and capital  and may have a material adverse effect on our capital  financial condition and results of operations 
in light of current market conditions  we regularly reassess the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the sufficiency of our allowance for loan losses 
our allowance for loan losses was million  or of total loans at december  compared to million  or of total loans at december  we recorded a provision for loan losses during the year ended december  of billion compared to a billion provision for loan losses for the year ended december   both of which are significantly higher than historical levels 
we also charged off approximately billion in loans  net of recoveries  during the year ended december   compared to billion in loans  net of recoveries  during the year ended december   both of which were also significantly higher than in previous periods 
even though our credit trends showed improvement during compared to the prior two years  we expect that our levels of non performing assets will remain at elevated levels in the foreseeable future as the deterioration in the credit and real estate markets causes borrowers to default 
further  the value of the collateral underlying a given loan  and the realizable value of such collateral in a foreclosure sale  likely will be negatively affected by the downturn in the real estate market  and therefore may result in an inability to realize a full recovery in the event that a borrower defaults on a loan 
in addition  as we execute our 
table of contents previously announced strategy to dispose of non performing assets  we will realize additional future losses if the proceeds we receive upon disposition of assets are less than the recorded carrying value of such assets 
any additional non performing assets  loan charge offs  increases in the provision for loan losses or any inability by us to realize the full value of underlying collateral in the event of a loan default  could negatively affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations and the price of our securities 
we will realize additional future losses if our levels of non performing assets do not moderate and if the proceeds we receive upon liquidation of assets are less than the carrying value of such assets 
in  we announced a strategy to aggressively dispose of non performing assets  and our refreshed strategic plan includes specific goals around  among other things  reduction of non performing asset levels 
during each of and  we completed sales of approximately billion of ore  problem loans and potential problem loans  and we presently expect to continue our sales of distressed assets during the actual volume of future distressed asset sales could increase based on regulatory directives  the level of migration of performing loans to problem loan status  as well as opportunities to sell such assets  thus resulting in higher credit costs 
conversely  the continuing weakness in the residential and commercial real estate markets may negatively impact our ability to dispose of distressed assets  and may result in higher credit losses on sales of distressed assets 
non performing assets are recorded on our financial statements at the estimated fair value  which considers management s plans for disposition 
we will realize additional future losses if the proceeds we receive upon dispositions of assets are less than the recorded carrying value of such assets 
if market conditions continue to decline  the magnitude of losses we may realize upon the disposition of non performing assets may increase  which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not realize the expected benefits from our strategic plan 
in the second half of synovus announced an update of its three year strategic plan to address these challenges and define strategies for expense reduction  streamlining of processes and long term growth initiatives 
the plan s key strategic elements are focused on the following areas enhancing the sales and service approach for targeted customer segments  aligning the cost structure with the current size of the organization  and enhancing the customer experience by streamlining processes 
the plan s stated goals include significant declines in non performing assets and potential problem loan levels  a further reduction in cre loan concentration  and substantial growth in the c i loan portfolio 
the goals also include substantial cost reductions and capital ratios that exceed regulatory requirements and position synovus favorably among its peers 

table of contents in january  synovus identified and announced efficiency and growth initiatives implementing the updated strategic plan  including the following efficiency initiatives expected to generate an estimated million in annual expense savings by the end of  with approximately million of these savings to be realized in the announced million in annual expense savings will be achieved primarily through the reduction of approximately positions during across our five state footprint and through the closing of branches 
enhancements to synovus large corporate banking initiative  including the addition of syndicated credit program expertise and realignment of existing personnel  designed to utilize synovus relationship based delivery model approach to build relationships with larger commercial customers across synovus five state footprint and connect more commercial customers with synovus full suite of specialized commercial banking products and services  including private banking  treasury management  asset based lending  insurance  and wealth management 
streamlining of processes and enhanced product offerings and technology to improve the customer experience and reduce operating inefficiencies 
the estimates and assumptions in the strategic plan and the related operating plan and restructuring of synovus cost base may or may not prove to be accurate in some respects 
in addition  synovus is subject to various risks inherent in its business 
these risks may cause the anticipated results from our strategic plan and cost reduction initiatives not to be achieved in their entirety  not to be accomplished within the expected time frame  or to result in implementation charges beyond those currently contemplated or could result in some other unanticipated adverse impact 
furthermore  the implementation of these initiatives may have unintended impacts on synovus ability to attract and retain business and customers  while revenue enhancement ideas may not be successful in the marketplace or may result in unintended costs 
accordingly  we cannot guarantee that the anticipated benefits from our strategic plan and cost reduction initiatives will be realized  and we may be unable to execute our business strategy and achieve our strategic and financial objectives  which may result in further regulatory scrutiny 
if economic conditions worsen or regulatory capital rules are modified  we may be required to undertake additional strategic initiatives to improve our capital position 
during and  synovus announced and executed a number of strategic capital initiatives to bolster our capital position against credit deterioration and to provide additional capital as synovus pursued its aggressive asset disposition strategy 
as of december   synovus tier capital ratio was  our tier common equity ratio was  and synovus and synovus bank were considered well capitalized under current regulatory standards 
see part i item business  supervision  regulation and other factors prompt corrective action of this report for a discussion of the definition of well capitalized 
this regulatory capital framework is expected to change in important respects as a result of the dodd frank act and a separate  international regulatory capital initiative known 
table of contents as basel iii 
in december  bcbs finalized new regulatory capital standards  known as basel iii  which are aimed at capital reform  seek to further strengthen financial institutions capital positions by mandating a higher minimum level of common equity to be held  along with a capital conservation buffer to withstand future periods of stress 
at present  our tier common equity is in excess of the minimum common equity and additional conservation buffer stipulated by these newly proposed requirements 
regardless  complying with these new capital requirements will likely affect our operations  and the extent to which we will be affected will be known with more certainty once additional clarity is provided on the underlying details of these new requirements 
these new requirements have been endorsed by the us banking regulators  but have not yet been translated by the regulators into official regulation for us financial institutions 
it is anticipated that the regulators will adopt new regulatory capital requirements similar to those proposed by the bcbs and the new requirements are anticipated to be phased in for us financial institutions beginning in it is widely anticipated that the new capital requirements brought about by the implementation of the dodd frank act and basel iii for most bank and financial holding companies  as well as for most insured depository institutions  will increase  although the nature and amounts of the increase have not yet been specified 
synovus continually monitors its capital position particularly as capital is impacted by current economic conditions  actual performance against forecasted credit losses  peer capital levels  and regulatory capital standards and pressures  and engages in regular discussions with its regulators regarding capital at both synovus and synovus bank 
if economic conditions or other factors worsen to a materially greater degree than the assumptions underlying management s current internal assessment of our capital position or if minimum regulatory capital requirements for us or our subsidiary bank increase as the result of legislative changes or informal or formal regulatory directives  then we would be required to pursue one or more additional capital improvement strategies  including  among others  balance sheet optimization strategies  asset sales  and or the sale of securities to one or more third parties 
given the current economic and market conditions and our recent financial performance and related credit ratings  there can be no assurance that any such transactions will be available to us on favorable terms  if at all  or that we would be able to realize the anticipated benefits of such transactions 
we also cannot predict the effect that these transactions would have on the market price of our common stock 
in addition  if we issue additional equity securities in these transactions  including options  warrants  preferred stock or convertible securities  such newly issued securities could cause significant dilution to the holders of our common stock 
further adverse changes in our credit rating could increase the cost of our funding from the capital markets 
during the second quarter of  moody s investors service  standard and poor s ratings services and fitch ratings downgraded our long term debt to below investment grade 
on april   moody s investor service issued a further downgrade 
the ratings agencies regularly evaluate us and synovus bank  and their ratings of our long term debt are based on a number of factors  including our financial strength as well as factors not entirely within our control  including conditions affecting the financial services industry generally 
in light of the continuing difficulties in the financial services industry and the housing and 
table of contents financial markets  there can be no assurance that we will not receive additional adverse changes in our ratings  which could adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain funding and the way in which we are perceived in the capital markets 
we cannot predict whether existing customer relationships or opportunities for future relationships could be further affected by customers who choose to do business with a higher rated institution 
we may be unable to access historical and alternative sources of liquidity  which could adversely affect our overall liquidity 
liquidity represents the extent to which we have readily available sources of funding needed to meet the needs of our depositors  borrowers and creditors  to support asset growth  to maintain reserve requirements  and to otherwise sustain our operations and the operations of our subsidiary bank 
synovus bank primarily generates liquidity from earnings and deposits 
in the current competitive environment  customer confidence is a critical element in growing and retaining deposits 
in this regard  synovus bank s asset quality could play a larger role in the stability of the deposit base 
in the event asset quality declines significantly from its current level  synovus bank s ability to grow and retain deposits could be diminished 
as a result of the charter consolidation  we are unable to continue to offer our synovus shared deposit products 
see deposits and capital resources and liquidity under part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this report 
while we intend to continue aggressively pursuing retention of this deposit base  there can be no assurance that the remaining shared deposits will remain on deposit at synovus bank 
the possibility of this deposit outflow could adversely impact synovus bank s liquidity 
we must maintain adequate liquidity at the holding company level for various operating needs  including the servicing of debt  the payment of general corporate expenses  and the payment of dividends to shareholders 
in addition to our ordinary course liquidity needs  current conditions in the public markets for bank holding companies  dividend payments on our series a preferred stock  and capital needs of our subsidiary bank have put additional pressure on our liquidity 
the primary source of liquidity at the holding company level is dividends from synovus bank 
synovus has not had positive earnings since synovus bank is currently subject to a memorandum of understanding that prohibits it from paying any cash dividends to us without regulatory approval 
in addition to dividends from synovus bank  we have historically had access to a number of alternative sources of liquidity  including the capital markets  but there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain such liquidity on terms that are favorable to us  or at all 
if our access to these traditional and alternative sources of liquidity is diminished or only available on unfavorable terms and we continue to experience increased demand for liquidity at the holding company level then our overall liquidity and financial condition will be adversely affected 

table of contents our net interest income could be negatively affected by the lower level of short term interest rates and a decrease in total loans 
net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income that we earn on interest earning assets and the interest expense that we pay on interest bearing liabilities  is a major component of our income 
our net interest income is our primary source of revenue from our operations 
the federal reserve reduced interest rates on three occasions in by a total of basis points  to  and by another basis points  to a range of to  during interest rates during and have remained at the range of to as set by the federal reserve during a significant portion of our loans  including residential construction and development loans and other commercial loans  bear interest at variable rates 
the interest rates on a significant portion of these loans decrease when the federal reserve reduces interest rates  which may reduce our net interest income 
in addition  in order to compete for deposits in our primary market areas  we may offer more attractive interest rates to depositors  or we may have to pursue other sources of liquidity  such as wholesale funds 
our total loans decreased to billion as of december  compared to billion as of december  a decrease in loans outstanding and lower realized yields on investment securities reduced our net interest income during the year ended december  and could cause additional pressure on net interest income in future periods 
this reduction in net interest income also may be exacerbated by the high level of competition that we face in our primary market area 
any significant reduction in our net interest income could negatively affect our business and could have a material adverse impact on our capital  financial condition and results of operations 
changes in the cost and availability of funding due to changes in the deposit market and credit market  or the way in which we are perceived in such markets  may adversely affect our capital resources  liquidity and financial results 
in managing our consolidated balance sheet  we depend on access to a variety of sources of funding to provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet our commitments and business needs  and to accommodate the transaction and cash management needs of our customers 
sources of funding available to us  and upon which we rely as regular components of our liquidity and funding management strategy  include borrowings from the federal home loan bank and brokered deposits 
see liquidity and capital resources under part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this report 
we also have historically enjoyed a solid reputation in the capital markets and have been able to raise funds in the form of either short or long term borrowings or equity issuances 
if  due to market disruptions  perceptions about our credit ratings or other factors  we are unable to access the capital markets  our capital resources and liquidity may be adversely affected 
in general  the amount  type and cost of our funding  including from other financial institutions  the capital markets and deposits  directly impacts our costs in operating our business and growing our assets and therefore  can positively or negatively affect our financial 
table of contents results 
a number of factors could make funding more difficult  more expensive or unavailable on any terms  including  but not limited to  further reductions in our debt ratings  financial results and losses  changes within our organization  specific events that adversely impact our reputation  disruptions in the capital markets  specific events that adversely impact the financial services industry  counterparty availability  changes affecting our assets  the corporate and regulatory structure  interest rate fluctuations  general economic conditions and the legal  regulatory  accounting and tax environments governing our funding transactions 
also  we compete for funding with other banks and similar companies  many of which are substantially larger  and have more capital and other resources than we do 
in addition  as some of these competitors consolidate with other financial institutions  these advantages may increase 
competition from these institutions may increase the cost of funds 
future losses will result in an additional valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
recapture of the deferred tax asset balance ie  reversal of the valuation allowance is subject to considerable judgment 
during  synovus reached a three year cumulative pre tax loss position 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in this report 
under gaap  cumulative losses in recent years are considered significant negative evidence which is difficult to overcome in assessing the realizability of a deferred tax asset 
as a result  beginning with the second quarter of  synovus no longer considers future taxable income in determining the realizability of its deferred tax assets 
this required an increase in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of approximately million in and million in  which adversely impacted synovus results of operations for these periods 
synovus expects to reverse the majority of the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets once it has demonstrated a sustainable return to profitability 
however  the reversal of the valuation allowance is subject to considerable judgment 
additionally  even after the recovery of the deferred tax asset balance under gaap  which would immediately benefit gaap capital and the tangible common equity ratio  there will remain limitations on the ability to include the deferred tax assets for regulatory capital purposes 
see income tax expense under part ii item management s discussion and analysis of operating results and financial condition of this report 
issuances or sales of common stock or other equity securities could result in an ownership change as defined for us federal income tax purposes 
in the event an ownership change were to occur  our ability to fully utilize a significant portion of our us federal and state tax net operating losses and certain built in losses that have not been recognized for tax purposes could be impaired as a result of the operation of section of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
our ability to use certain realized net operating losses and unrealized built in losses to offset future taxable income may be significantly limited if we experience an ownership change as defined by section of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code 
an ownership change under section generally occurs when a change in the aggregate percentage ownership of the stock of the corporation held by five percent 
table of contents shareholders increases by more than fifty percentage points over a rolling three year period 
a corporation experiencing an ownership change generally is subject to an annual limitation on its utilization of pre change losses and certain post change recognized built in losses equal to the value of the stock of the corporation immediately before the ownership change  multiplied by the long term tax exempt rate subject to certain adjustments 
the annual limitation is increased each year to the extent that there is an unused limitation in a prior year 
since us federal net operating losses generally may be carried forward for up to years  the annual limitation also effectively provides a cap on the cumulative amount of pre change losses and certain post change recognized built in losses that may be utilized 
pre change losses and certain post change recognized built in losses in excess of the cap are effectively unable to be used to reduce future taxable income 
in some circumstances  issuances or sales of our stock including any common stock or other equity issuances or debt for equity exchanges and certain transactions involving our stock that are outside of our control could result in an ownership change under section in april  we adopted a shareholder rights plan  which provides an economic disincentive for any one person or group acting in concert to become an owner  for relevant tax purposes  of or more of our stock 
while adoption of the rights plan should reduce the likelihood that future transactions in our stock will result in an ownership change  there can be no assurance that the rights plan will be effective to deter a stockholder from increasing its ownership interests beyond the limits set by the rights plan or that an ownership change will not occur in the future 
furthermore  our ability to enter into future transactions may be impaired if such transactions result in an unanticipated ownership change under section if an ownership change under section were to occur  the value of our net operating losses and a portion of the net unrealized built in losses will be impaired 
because a valuation allowance currently exists for substantially the full amount of our deferred tax assets  no additional charge to earnings would result 
however  an ownership change  as defined above  could adversely impact our ability to recover the deferred tax asset in the future 
we presently are subject to  and in the future may become subject to  additional supervisory actions and or enhanced regulation that could have a material negative effect on our business  reputation  operating flexibility  financial condition and the value of our common stock 
under federal and state laws and regulations pertaining to the safety and soundness of insured depository institutions  state banking regulators  the federal reserve  and separately the fdic as the insurer of bank deposits  have the authority to compel or restrict certain actions on our part if they determine that we have insufficient capital or are otherwise operating in a manner that may be deemed to be inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices 
under this authority  our bank regulators can require us to enter into informal or formal supervisory agreements  including board resolutions  memoranda of understanding  written agreements and consent or cease and desist orders  pursuant to which we could be required to take identified corrective actions to address cited concerns  or to refrain from taking certain actions 

table of contents as a result of losses that we have incurred to date and our high level of credit losses and non performing assets  we entered into a memorandum of understanding with the federal reserve bank of atlanta and the georgia commissioner pursuant to which we agreed to implement plans that are intended to  among other things  minimize credit losses and reduce the amount of our problem assets  limit and manage our concentrations in commercial real estate loans  improve our credit risk management and related policies and procedures  address liquidity management and current and future capital requirements  strengthen enterprise risk management practices  and provide for succession planning for key corporate and regional management positions and our board of directors 
the memorandum of understanding also requires that we inform and consult with the federal reserve board prior to declaring and paying any future dividends  and obtain the prior approval of the federal reserve bank of atlanta and the georgia commissioner prior to increasing the quarterly cash dividend on our common stock above per share 
in addition  synovus bank is presently subject to a memorandum of understanding with the georgia commissioner and the fdic that is substantially similar in substance and scope to the holding company memorandum of understanding described above 
the bank memorandum of understanding also requires that synovus bank obtain approval from the georgia commissioner and the fdic prior to paying any cash dividends to synovus and provides that  as a result of our charter consolidation  we will take all necessary steps to avoid customer confusion as a result of our proposed use of trade names at our various bank branches and to update our long term strategic plan to reflect the charter consolidation and the various actions we have otherwise agreed to implement under the memorandum of understanding 
synovus bank is presently also subject to a memorandum of understanding with the georgia commissioner and the fdic relating to its subsidiary  synovus mortgage 
in the synovus mortgage memorandum of understanding  synovus bank has agreed to implement plans that are intended to  among other things  ensure appropriate oversight of synovus mortgage and synovus mortgage s compliance program relating to compliance and fair lending laws  rules and regulations 
if we are unable to comply with the terms of our current supervisory agreements  or if we become subject to and are unable to comply with the terms of any future regulatory actions or directives  supervisory agreements  or orders  then we could become subject to additional  heightened supervisory actions and orders  possibly including consent orders  prompt corrective action restrictions and or other regulatory actions  including prohibitions on the payment of dividends on our common stock and series a preferred stock 
if our regulators were to take such additional supervisory actions  then we could  among other things  become subject to significant restrictions on our ability to develop any new business  as well as restrictions on our existing business  and we could be required to raise additional capital  dispose of certain assets and liabilities within a prescribed period of time  or both 
the terms of any such supervisory action could have a material negative effect on our business  reputation  operating flexibility  financial condition  and the value of our common stock

table of contents recent legislative and regulatory initiatives applicable to financial institutions in general and tarp recipients in particular could adversely impact our ability to attract and retain key employees and pursue business opportunities and could put us at a competitive disadvantage vis vis our competitors and damage our reputation if these competitors repay their tarp funds before us 
our success depends upon the ability to attract and retain highly motivated  well qualified personnel 
we face significant competition in the recruitment of qualified employees from financial institutions and others 
until we repay the tarp funds  we are subject to additional  and possibly changing  regulatory scrutiny and restrictions regarding the compensation of certain executives and associates as established under tarp guidelines 
the increased scrutiny and restrictions related to our compensation practices may adversely impact our ability to recruit  retain and motivate key employees  which in turn may impact our ability to pursue business opportunities and could otherwise materially adversely affect our businesses and results of operations 
see item business actions by federal and state regulators and supervision  regulation and other factors in this report 
in addition to the guidelines on incentive and senior officer compensation under tarp  the dodd frank act provides for the implementation of a variety of corporate governance and compensation practices applicable to all public companies  including synovus  which may impact certain of synovus executive officers and employees 
these provisions include  but are not limited to  requiring companies to claw back incentive compensation under certain circumstances  provide shareholders the opportunity to cast a non binding vote on executive compensation  to consider the independence of compensation advisors and new executive compensation disclosure requirements 
such provisions with respect to compensation  in addition to other competitive pressures  may have an adverse effect on the ability of synovus to attract and retain skilled personnel 
further  in june   the federal reserve  the office of the comptroller of the currency  the office of thrift supervision  and the fdic jointly issued comprehensive final guidance designed to ensure that incentive compensation policies do not undermine the safety and soundness of banking organizations by encouraging employees to take imprudent risks 
this regulation significantly restricts the amount  form  and context in which we pay incentive compensation 
these restrictions may put us at a competitive disadvantage vis vis our competitors that have repaid all tarp funds before us  or who did not receive tarp funds  and with non financial institutions in terms of attracting retaining senior level employees 
furthermore  to the extent that our competitors repay their tarp funds before us  our reputation and the public perception of our financial condition may be negatively affected  which could adversely affect our stock price 

table of contents as a result of our participation in the capital purchase program  we may become subject to additional regulation  and we cannot predict the cost or effects of compliance at this time 
in connection with our participation in the capital purchase program administered under the tarp  we may face additional regulations and or reporting requirements  including  but not limited to  the following section of the standardized securities purchase agreement that we entered into with the treasury provides  in part  that the treasury may unilaterally amend any provision of this agreement to the extent required to comply with any changes after the signing date in applicable federal statutes 
this provision could give congress the ability to impose after the fact terms and conditions on participants in the capital purchase program 
as a participant in the capital purchase program  we would be subject to any such retroactive legislation 
we cannot predict whether or in what form any proposed regulation or statute will be adopted or the extent to which our business may be affected by any new regulation or statute 
participation in the capital purchase program will limit our ability to repurchase our common stock or to increase the dividend on our common stock above per share  or to repurchase  our common stock without the consent of the treasury until the earlier of december  or until the series a preferred stock has been redeemed in whole  or until the treasury has transferred all of the series a preferred stock to a third party 
the fdic has requested that all state chartered banks monitor and report how they have spent funds received from the treasury in connection with tarp funds through as a result  we may face increased regulation  and compliance with such regulation may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities 
we cannot predict the effect that participating in these programs may have on our business  financial condition  or results of operations in the future or what additional regulations and or requirements we may become subject to as a result of our participation in these programs 
regulation of the financial services industry is undergoing major changes  and future legislation could increase our cost of doing business or harm our competitive position 
in and  many emergency government programs enacted in in response to the financial crisis and the recession slowed or wound down  and global regulatory and legislative focus has generally moved to a second phase of broader reform and a restructuring of financial institution regulation 
emergency programs that are winding down include tarp  which treasury extended until october  in order to retain an adequate financial stability reserve if financial conditions worsen and threaten the economy 
also  the debt guarantee program expired on october   with the guarantee period on such debt expiring on december  the transaction account guarantee portion of the program  which guarantees non interest bearing bank transaction accounts on an unlimited basis was extended until december  and recent amendments to the federal deposit insurance act provide full deposit insurance coverage for noninterest bearing transaction accounts and 
table of contents interest on lawyer trust accounts or ioltas beginning december   for a two year period 
in addition  the federal reserve has begun to sell off its portfolio of mortgage backed securities  which it previously purchased in order to stabilize the residential mortgage market

on july   president obama signed into law the dodd frank act  which will substantially change the legal and regulatory framework under which we operate over the next several years 
the dodd frank act represents a significant overhaul of many aspects of the regulation of the financial services industry  addressing  among other things  systemic risk  capital adequacy  deposit insurance assessments  consumer financial protection  interchange fees  derivatives  lending limits  mortgage lending practices  registration of investment advisors and changes among the bank regulatory agencies 
among the provisions that may affect the operations of the bank or the company are the following creation of the bureau of consumer financial protection with centralized authority for consumer protection in the banking industry 
new limitations on federal preemption 
application of new regulatory capital requirements  including changes to leverage and risk based capital standards and changes to the components of permissible tiered capital 
requirement that the company and its subsidiary bank be well capitalized and well managed in order to engage in activities permitted for financial holding companies 
changes to the assessment base for deposit insurance premiums 
making permanent the  limit for federal deposit insurance and provide unlimited insurance coverage for noninterest bearing demand transaction accounts through repeal of the prohibition on the payment of interest on demand deposits  effective july   thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts 
restrictions on compensation  including a prohibition on incentive based compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk taking by covered financial institutions and are deemed to be excessive  or that may lead to material losses 
some of these and other major changes could materially impact the profitability of our business  the value of assets we hold or the collateral available for our loans  require changes to business practices or force us to discontinue businesses and expose us to additional costs  taxes  liabilities  enforcement actions and reputational risk 
many of these provisions became effective upon enactment of the dodd frank act  while others are subject to further study  rule making  and the discretion of regulatory bodies 
we cannot predict the effect that compliance with the dodd frank act or any implementing regulations will have on synovus businesses 
table of contents or its ability to pursue future business opportunities 
additional regulations resulting from the dodd frank act may materially adversely affect synovus business  financial condition or results of operations 
certain other reform proposals under consideration  including new proposed regulatory capital requirements proposed by the bcbs under basel iii  could result in synovus becoming subject to stricter capital requirements and leverage limits  and could also affect the scope  coverage  or calculation of capital  all of which could require us to reduce business levels or to raise capital  including in ways that may adversely impact our shareholders or creditors 
see part i item business supervision  regulation and other factors 
we cannot predict whether new legislation will be enacted and  if enacted  the effect that it  or any regulations  would have on our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
we may be required to pay significantly higher fdic premiums in the future 
the dodd frank act directs the fdic to amend its regulations to re define the method of calculation of an insured depository institution s insurance fund assessment 
the dodd frank act requires the assessment base to be an amount equal to the average consolidated total assets of the insured depository institution during the assessment period  minus the sum of the average tangible equity of the insured depository institution during the assessment period and an amount the fdic determines is necessary to establish assessments consistent with the risk based assessment system found in the federal deposit insurance act 
the fdic has issued final rules outlining this new insurance assessment methodology  which will impact the amount of synovus bank s insurance assessment 
in addition  the fdic may make additional changes to the way in which it calculates insurance premiums 
for example  the fdic has proposed using executive compensation as a factor in assessing the premiums paid by insured depository institutions to the deposit insurance fund 
we cannot predict the timing of any future changes  and if made  the effect that these changes could have on our insurance assessment 
the costs and effects of litigation  investigations or similar matters  or adverse facts and developments related thereto  could materially affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may be involved from time to time in a variety of litigation  investigations  inquiries or similar matters arising out of our business 
our insurance may not cover all claims that may be asserted against it and indemnification rights to which we are entitled may not be honored  and any claims asserted against us  regardless of merit or eventual outcome  may harm our reputation 
should the ultimate judgments or settlements in any litigation or investigation significantly exceed our insurance coverage  they could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  premiums for insurance covering the financial and banking sectors are rising 
we may not be able to obtain appropriate types or levels of insurance in the future  nor may we be able to obtain adequate replacement policies with acceptable terms or at historic rates  if at all 
we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties  and we routinely execute transactions with a variety of counterparties in the financial services industry 
as a result  defaults by  or even 
table of contents rumors or concerns about  one or more financial institutions with which we do business  or the financial services industry generally  have led to market wide liquidity problems in the past and could do so in the future and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions 
many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client 
in addition  our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral we hold cannot be sold at prices that are sufficient for us to recover the full amount of our exposure 
any such losses could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we are named in a several class action lawsuits and several related suits and inquiries  and if we are unable to resolve these matters favorably  then our business  operating results and financial condition would suffer

we cannot at this time predict the outcome of these matters or reasonably determine the probability of a material adverse result or reasonably estimate the range of potential exposure  if any  that these matters might have on us  our business  our financial condition  our cash flows  or our results of operations  although such effects could be materially adverse 
in addition  in the future  we may need to record litigation reserves with respect to these matters 
further  regardless of how these matters proceed  it could divert our management s attention and other resources away from our business 
we may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or indemnify mortgage loan purchasers as a result of breaches of representations and warranties  borrower fraud  or certain borrower defaults  which could harm our liquidity  results of operations and financial condition 
synovus mortgage sells substantially all of the mortgage loans that it originates 
while the loans are sold without recourse  the purchase agreements require synovus mortgage to make certain representations and warranties regarding the existence and sufficiency of file documentation and the absence of fraud by borrowers or other third parties such as appraisers in connection with obtaining the loan 
if it is determined that the loans sold were in breach of these representations or warranties  synovus mortgage has obligations to either repurchase the loan for the unpaid principal balance and related investor fees or make the purchaser whole for any economic losses associated with the loan 
in addition  the dodd frank act contains provisions designed to address perceived deficiencies in the residential mortgage loan origination and underwriting process  in part by creating new documentation requirements and underwriting criteria and increasing the potential liability of synovus and synovus mortgage to their customers if synovus and synovus mortgage fail to take steps to ensure and document that each borrower has the capacity and the ability to repay their loans 
to date  repurchase activity pursuant to the terms of these representations and warranties has been minimal and has primarily been associated with the periods from through from january  through december   synovus mortgage originated and sold approximately billion of first lien gse eligible mortgage loans and approximately billion of first and second lien non gse eligible mortgage loans 
while losses to date arising from such repurchases have been inconsequential  we cannot assure you that  in the current environment  synovus mortgage will not be required to repurchase substantially greater amounts of such mortgage loans or make related indemnity payments to the purchasers of our mortgage loans 
if the level of repurchase and indemnity demands become significant  synovus mortgage is alleged to be in non compliance with the regulations under the dodd frank act  our liquidity  results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected

economic overview synovus financial results for the year ended december  reflect improvement in total credit costs and a declining trend of inflows to non performing loans  but continued to be negatively impacted by weak housing markets  declining commercial real estate values  and heightened unemployment rates

these markets  including atlanta  florida  and south carolina  have been among the hardest hit nationwide in terms of real estate values 
during the second half of  certain economic measures began to indicate improvement in the us economy as a whole  however  key measures impacting synovus southeastern markets  including employment growth and residential building permits  may lag other measures of economic improvement 
these factors have severely impacted synovus credit costs  resulting in elevated levels of loan charge offs and 
table of contents non performing asset inflows  significant losses on distressed asset dispositions  and further valuation adjustments on existing non performing assets 
the weakened economy has significantly impacted the performance of synovus residential construction and development and land acquisition portfolios  however  synovus has also experienced weakness in other segments of the commercial loan portfolio  particularly in industries that are impacted by commercial real estate and residential development factors

most of the failures in these two states were in synovus footprint  including atlanta and west florida 
for  loan demand has remained weak in most of synovus markets due to economic conditions and a decrease in consumer confidence

mortgage loan repurchase obligations and foreclosure practices during  financial institutions experienced a dramatic increase in the number of repurchase demands they received  including from government sponsored entities  mortgage insurers  and other purchasers of residential mortgage backed securitizations  due to findings of mortgage fraud and underwriting deficiencies in the mortgage origination process  and misrepresentations in the packaging of mortgages by certain mortgage lenders 
also during  foreclosure practices of financial institutions nationwide came under scrutiny due to the discovery of fraudulent documentation and questionable residential foreclosure procedures 
table of contents of certain financial institutions

see mortgage banking in this report for further discussion of synovus experience with residential mortgage repurchase obligations and foreclosure activity in its home equity and consumer mortgage loan portfolios 
overview of financial results for the year ended december   synovus reported a net loss attributable to common shareholders of million  or per common share  as compared to billion  or per common share  for the year ended december  the improved results are primarily due to a million decline in credit costs provision expense  losses on foreclosed real estate  and other credit costs which was partially offset by a lower income tax benefit in million in compared to million in 
both years included transaction gains in similar amounts reflects as million gain from the sale of the merchant services business while reflects total pre tax gains from the sale of visa and mastercard shares and sales of investment securities totaling million 
although credit costs  charge offs  and non performing asset levels remain elevated  most credit quality measures have shown improvement during total provision expense in was billion  a million or improvement from net charge offs declined from billion in to billion in non performing assets declined from billion at december  to billion at december  the decrease in provision expense was driven by a lower level of non performing loan npl inflows 
npl inflows for were billion in  compared to billion in the provision expense for both years was impacted by distressed loan dispositions and transfers to held for sale which totaled approximately billion in compared to approximately billion in  and resulted in additional provision expense of approximately million in and approximately million in while provision expense and loans charge offs in declined from levels  these amounts continued to remain elevated when compared to historical levels 
the elevated level of provision expense and loan charge offs in was driven by commercial real estate credits 
provision expense attributable to the commercial real estate portfolio was million or of the total expense for the year  while net charge offs attributable to this portfolio were million or of the total net charge offs for the year 
family properties represented million or of total commercial real estate net charge offs 
provision expense attributable to the commercial and industrial portfolio was million  or of the total expense for the year  while charge offs attributable to this portfolio were million or of total charge offs 
the decline in non performing loans in was driven by a reduction in the level of npl inflows as well as the disposition of distressed loans as discussed above 

table of contents pre tax  pre credit costs income which excludes provision for losses on loans  other credit costs  and certain other items  was million for  down million from million for see reconciliation of non gaap financial measures in this report 
the decrease in pre tax  pre credit costs income was due to lower net interest income resulting from shrinkage in the loan portfolio and lower non interest income 
the net interest margin increased basis points to for compared to for the improvement in the net interest margin was due to a basis point decrease in the effective cost of funds  partially offset by a basis point decrease in the yield on earning assets 
the decrease in the effective cost of funds was driven by the downward re pricing of maturing time deposits and declines in money market rates 
the decrease in earning asset yields was driven by a decline in the yield on investment securities  and a shift to lower earning assets through the decline in average loans and an increase in balances held at the federal reserve bank 
loan yields increased basis points to due to a modest decline in the cost to carry non performing assets and an improvement in new loan pricing 
total loans were billion at december   a decline from year end the decline in loans was driven by charge offs  the sale of distressed loans  and pay downs which continued to exceed new originations 
however  while net pay downs originations less payments and pay offs continued to contribute to the decline in loans outstanding  the trend began to improve in the second half of total deposits decreased by billion since year end the decrease was driven by a billion decline in national market brokered deposit accounts  as synovus reduced its dependence on funding from these products through planned reductions during  and a billion decline in non brokered time deposits 
these declines were offset in part by growth in non interest bearing demand deposit accounts and non brokered money market accounts of million and million  respectively 
at december   national market brokered deposits represented of synovus total deposits compared to at december  synovus current level of national market brokered deposits is higher than average for banking institutions similar to it 
synovus intends to continue to reduce the level of this type of deposits during total shareholders equity increased by million to billion at year end a public offering which provided billion in additional capital was largely offset by the negative impact of elevated credit costs 
synovus continues to actively monitor its capital position as well as economic conditions  evolving industry capital standards  and changes in regulatory standards and requirements 
as part of its ongoing management of capital  synovus will continue to monitor its capital position and identify  consider  and pursue additional strategies to bolster its capital position as deemed necessary 
liquidity is an important consideration in assessing synovus financial strength 
in light of the weakened economy  current market conditions  synovus recent financial performance  and related credit ratings  synovus expects to currently maintain an above average short term liquidity cushion primarily in the form of interest bearing funds with the federal reserve bank

bp basis point critical accounting policies the accounting and financial reporting policies of synovus conform to gaap and to general practices within the banking and financial services industries 
synovus has identified certain of its accounting policies as critical accounting policies 
in determining which 
table of contents accounting policies are critical in nature  synovus has identified the policies that require significant judgment or involve complex estimates 
the application of these policies has a significant impact on synovus financial statements 
synovus financial results could differ significantly if different judgments or estimates are applied in the application of these policies 
allowance for loan losses notes and to synovus consolidated financial statements contain a discussion of the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses at december  was million 
the allowance for loan losses is a significant estimate and is regularly evaluated by synovus for adequacy 
the allowance for loan losses is determined based on an analysis which assesses the inherent risk of probable loss within the loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses consists of two components the allocated and unallocated allowances 
both components of the allowance are available to cover inherent losses in the portfolio 
significant judgments or estimates made in the determination of the allowance for loan losses consist of the risk ratings for loans in the commercial loan portfolio  the valuation of the collateral for loans that are classified as impaired loans  the probability of default  the loss given default  the qualitative loss factors  and management s plan for disposition of non performing loans 
in determining an adequate allowance for loan losses  management makes numerous assumptions  estimates  and assessments which are inherently subjective and subject to change 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different provisions for losses on loans 
commercial loans risk ratings and loss factors commercial loans are assigned a risk rating on a nine point scale 
for commercial loans that are not considered impaired  the allocated allowance for loan losses is determined based upon the expected loss percentage factors that correspond to each risk rating 
the risk ratings are based on the borrowers credit risk profile considering factors such as debt service history and capacity  inherent risk in the credit eg  based on industry type and source of repayment  and collateral position 
ratings six through nine are modeled after the bank regulatory classifications of special mention  substandard  doubtful  and loss 
each loan is assigned a risk rating during the approval process 
this process begins with a rating recommendation from the loan officer responsible for originating the loan 
the rating recommendation is subject to approvals from other members of management  regional credit  and or loan committees depending on the size and type of credit 
ratings are reevaluated in connection with the credit review process 
for larger credits  ratings are reevaluated no less frequently than annually and more frequently when there is an indication of potential deterioration of a specific credit relationship 
additionally  an independent loan review function evaluates the bank s risk rating process on an on going basis 
expected loss percentage factors are based on the probable loss including qualitative factors 
the probable loss considers the probability of default pd  the loss given default lgd  and certain qualitative factors as determined by loan type and risk rating 

table of contents through march   the pd factors were based on industry data 
beginning april   the pd factors are based on internal default experience because this was the first reporting period when sufficient internal default data became available 
management believes that this data provides a more accurate estimate of the pd 
this change resulted in a net increase in the allocated allowance for loan losses for the commercial portfolio of approximately million during the three months ended june  the pd factors are updated annually 
through september   the lgd factors were based on industry data 
beginning october   the lgd factors are based on industry and internal lgd experience because this was the first reporting period when sufficient internal lgd data became available 
management believes it is prudent to apply a phased in approach to implementation of the internal lgd data 
accordingly  implementation will take place over four quarters beginning in the fourth quarter of at december   the external lgd data is weighted and the internal data is weighted 
this change resulted in a decrease in the allowance for loan losses for the commercial portfolio of approximately million during the three months ended december  the qualitative factors consider  among others  credit concentrations  recent levels and trends in delinquencies and nonaccrual loans  and growth in the loan portfolio 
the occurrence of certain events could result in changes to the expected loss factors 
accordingly  these expected loss factors are reviewed periodically and updated as necessary 
impaired loans nonaccrual commercial loans to borrowers with aggregate outstanding borrowings of million or more are considered impaired and individually assessed for impairment 
at december   all nonaccrual impaired loans are collateral dependent 
most of these loans are secured by real estate 
for the majority of collateral dependent impaired loans  the estimated fair value of the real estate securing these loans is generally determined based upon appraisals performed by a certified or licensed appraiser 
management also considers other factors or recent developments  such as selling costs and anticipated sales values taking into account management s plans for disposition  which could result in adjustment to the collateral value estimates indicated in the appraisals 
the assumptions used in determining fair value are subject to significant judgment 
use of different assumptions  for example changes in market values or management s plan for disposition  could have a significant impact on the resulting estimate of fair value 
if a collateral dependent nonaccrual loan is placed on impaired status and a current appraisal is not available generally at or near the end of a calendar quarter  management records an allowance for loan losses based on the loan s risk rating while an updated appraisal is being obtained 
as of december   the amount of individually impaired nonaccrual loans was million 
million of these loans represent loans for which there is no allowance for loan losses as the estimated losses have been charged off 
management also includes accruing troubled debt restructurings tdrs in total reported impaired loans 
such loans are considered impaired as it is probable that the company 
table of contents will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the original loan agreement 
however  these loans are not considered to be non performing because they are performing in accordance with the restructured terms 
synovus does not consider accruing tdrs to be collateral dependent 
at december   accruing tdrs were approximately million 
retail loans loss factors the allocated allowance for loan losses for retail loans is generally determined by segregating the retail loan portfolio into pools of homogeneous loan categories 
expected loss factors applied to these pools are based on the probable loss including qualitative factors 
the probable loss considers the pd  the lgd  and certain qualitative factors as determined by loan category and risk rating 
the pd factors are based on internal default experience 
the lgd factors are based on industry data because sufficient internal data is not yet available 
the qualitative factors consider  among others  credit concentrations  recent levels and trends in delinquencies and nonaccrual loans  and growth in the loan portfolio 
the occurrence of certain events could result in changes to the loss factors 
accordingly  these loss factors are reviewed periodically and modified as necessary 
unallocated component the unallocated component of the allowance for loan losses is considered necessary to provide for certain environmental and economic factors that affect the probable loss inherent in the entire loan portfolio 
unallocated loss factors included in the determination of the unallocated allowance are economic factors  changes in the experience  ability  and depth of lending management and staff  and changes in lending policies and procedures including underwriting standards  results of loan reviews  and imprecision in assigned loan risk ratings 
certain macro economic factors and changes in business conditions and developments could have a material impact on the collectability of the overall portfolio 
as an example  continuing declines in collateral values could have a material impact on certain borrowers ability to pay 
the unallocated component is meant to cover such risks 
other real estate other real estate  consisting of properties obtained through foreclosure or through an in substance foreclosure in satisfaction of loans  is reported at the lower of cost or fair value  determined on the basis of current appraisals  comparable sales  and other estimates of value obtained principally from independent sources  adjusted for estimated selling costs 
management also considers other factors  or recent developments  such as changes in absorption rates or market conditions from the time of valuation and anticipated sales values considering management s plans for disposition  which have resulted in adjustments to the collateral value estimates indicated in certain appraisals 
at the time of foreclosure or initial possession of collateral  any excess of the loan balance over the fair value of the real estate held as collateral is treated as a charge against the allowance for loan losses 
subsequent declines in the fair value of ore below the new cost basis are recorded through valuation 
table of contents adjustments 
significant judgments and complex estimates are required in estimating the fair value of other real estate  and the period of time within which such estimates can be considered current is significantly shortened during periods of market volatility 
in response to market conditions and other economic factors  management may utilize liquidation sales as part of its problem asset disposition strategy 
as a result of the significant judgments required in estimating fair value and the variables involved in different methods of disposition  the net proceeds realized from sales transactions could differ significantly from appraisals  comparable sales  and other estimates used to determine the fair value of other real estate 
management reviews the value of other real estate each quarter and adjusts the values as appropriate 
revenue and expenses from ore operations as well as gains or losses on sales and any subsequent adjustments to the value are recorded as foreclosed real estate expense  a component of non interest expense 
private equity investments private equity investments are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with realized and unrealized gains and losses included in non interest income in the results of operations in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa audit and accounting guide for investment companies 
synovus uses information provided by the fund managers in the initial determination of estimated fair value 
valuation factors such as recent or proposed purchase or sale of debt or equity  pricing by other dealers in similar securities  size of position held  liquidity of the market  comparable market multiples  and changes in economic conditions affecting the issuer are used in the final determination of estimated fair value 
the valuation of private equity investments requires significant management judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices  inherent lack of liquidity and the long term nature of such investments 
as a result  the net proceeds realized from transactions involving these assets could differ significantly from their estimated fair value 
asset impairment long lived assets and other intangibles synovus reviews long lived assets  such as property and equipment and other intangibles subject to amortization  including core deposit premiums  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the actual cash flows are not consistent with synovus estimates  an impairment charge may result 
deferred tax assets valuation allowance accounting standards codification asc or the codification provides accounting guidance for determining when a company is required to record a valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance is required for deferred tax assets if  based on available evidence  it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the asset 
table of contents may not be realized due to the inability to generate sufficient taxable income in the period and or of the character necessary to utilize the benefit of the deferred tax asset 
in making this assessment  all sources of taxable income available to realize the deferred tax asset are considered including taxable income in prior carry back years  future reversals of existing temporary differences  tax planning strategies and future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards 
the predictability that future taxable income  exclusive of reversing temporary differences  will occur is the most subjective of these four sources 
the presence of cumulative losses in recent years is considered significant negative evidence  making it difficult for a company to rely on future taxable income  exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards  as a reliable source of taxable income to realize a deferred tax asset 
judgment is a critical element in making this assessment 
changes in the valuation allowance that result from favorable changes in circumstances that cause a change in judgment about the realization of deferred tax assets in future years are recorded through income tax expense 
during the three months ended june   primarily as a result of increased credit losses  synovus determined that it would reach a three year cumulative pre tax loss position by the end of cumulative losses in recent years are considered significant negative evidence which is difficult to overcome in assessing the realizability of a deferred tax asset 
as a result  beginning with the second quarter of  synovus no longer considers future taxable income in determining the realizability of its deferred tax assets 
synovus estimate of the realization of its deferred tax assets is solely based on future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and an insignificant amount for currently available tax planning strategies 
during  synovus increased the valuation allowance on deferred income tax assets by million  resulting in a total valuation allowance of million at december  when synovus begins to report a pre tax profit  synovus expects that it will record minimal to no tax expense as reductions to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance will be recognized 
recapture of the deferred tax asset balance ie  reversal of the valuation allowance is subject to considerable judgment 
however  synovus expects to reverse the majority of the valuation allowance once synovus has demonstrated a sustainable return to profitability 
even after the recovery of the deferred tax asset balance under gaap  which would immediately benefit gaap capital and the tangible common equity ratio  there will remain limitations on the ability to include the deferred tax assets for regulatory capital purposes 
this is because once taxes paid in carryback periods are exhausted  financial institutions must deduct from tier i capital the lower of the amount by which net deferred tax assets exceed what they would expect to realize within one year or the amount by which the net deferred tax assets exceeds of tier i capital 
synovus ability to use its tax attributes could be substantially limited in the event of an ownership change as defined under section of the internal revenue code and related internal revenue service pronouncements 
in general  an ownership change would occur if synovus percent shareholders  as defined under section  collectively increase their ownership in synovus by more than percentage points over a rolling three year period 
the 
table of contents shareholder rights plan is designed to reduce the likelihood that synovus experiences such an ownership change by deterring acquisitions that would increase the holdings of existing percent shareholders or cause any person or group to become a percent shareholder 
percent shareholders generally do not include certain institutional holders  such as mutual fund companies  that hold synovus equity securities on behalf of several individual mutual funds where no single fund owns percent or more of synovus equity securities 
synovus public offerings of  shares of common stock and  tangible equity units in the second quarter of did not result in an ownership change under section on april   the synovus board of directors adopted a shareholder rights plan designed to preserve substantial tax assets 
the rights plan provides an economic disincentive for any one person or group acting in concert to become a shareholder 
see part i item ia 
risk factors in this report 
this plan is similar to tax benefit preservation plans adopted by other public companies with significant tax attributes 
synovus tax attributes include net operating losses  capital losses  and certain built in losses that it could utilize in certain circumstances to offset taxable income and reduce its federal income tax liability 
discontinued operations synovus completed the sale of its merchant services business on march  accordingly  the revenues and expenses of the merchant services business have been reported as discontinued operations for the years ended december    and income from discontinued operations for the year ended december  includes the gain on sale of this business

the fair value of the debt component was determined using a discounted cash flow model using the following assumptions quarterly cash payments of  a maturity date of may   and an assumed discount rate of 
the discount rate used for estimating the fair value was determined by obtaining yields for comparably rated issuers trading in the market  considering the market yield of existing synovus subordinated debt  the credit rating of synovus  as well as the junior nature of the new debt 
the debt component was recorded at fair value  and the discount is being amortized using the level yield method over the term of the instrument to the settlement date of may  the carrying value of the debt component  net of unamortized discount  was million at december  the fair value of the equity component was determined using a black scholes valuation model using the following weighted average assumptions risk free interest rate of  expected stock price volatility of  c dividend yield of  and term of years

in november  synovus sold its remaining visa class b shares to another visa usa member financial institution for million and recognized a gain on sale of million 
in conjunction with the sale  synovus entered into a derivative contract with the purchaser which provides for settlements between the parties based upon a change in the ratio for conversion of visa class b shares to visa class a shares 
the fair value of the derivative liability of million and million  at december  and  is based on an estimate of visa s exposure to liability based upon probability weighted potential outcomes of the covered litigation

net interest income net interest income interest income less interest expense is a major component of net income  representing earnings from the primary business of gathering funds from customer deposits and other sources  and investing those funds primarily in loans and investment securities 
synovus long term objective is to manage those assets and liabilities to maximize net interest income while balancing interest rate  credit  liquidity  and capital risks 
net interest income is presented in this discussion on a tax equivalent basis  so that the income from assets exempt from federal income taxes is adjusted based on a statutory marginal federal tax rate of in all years see table 
the net interest margin is defined as taxable equivalent net interest income divided by average total interest earning assets and provides an indication of the efficiency of the earnings from balance sheet activities 
the net interest margin is affected by changes in the spread between interest earning asset yields and 
table of contents interest bearing liability costs spread rate  and by the percentage of interest earning assets funded by non interest bearing funding sources 
net interest income for was million  down million  or  from on a taxable equivalent basis  net interest income decreased million  or  from during  average earning assets decreased billion  or  primarily the result of declines in net loans  offset in part by an increase in balances held with the federal reserve bank

net interest margin the net interest margin  for  represents a basis point increase from the yield on earning assets decreased basis points to and the effective cost of funds decreased basis points to 
the effective cost of funds includes non interest bearing funding sources primarily consisting of demand deposits 
the primary components of the yield on interest earning assets are loan yields  the yield on investment securities  and the yield on balances held with the federal reserve bank 
loan yields increased basis points to with improvement due to a modest decline in the cost to carry non performing assets and an improvement in loan origination pricing 
average net loans decreased billion  or  to billion in and represented of average interest earning assets in as compared to in while the demand for loans began to strengthen toward the end of  the decline in loans during reflects net pay downs principal repayments in excess of new loans funded  the impact of net charge offs  which were billion in  and the sale of distressed loans 
yields on investment securities decreased by basis points primarily due to the continued historically low level of bond market yields and the reinvestment of cash flows from older higher yielding securities 
the yield on balances held at the federal reserve bank remained the same at in as in while the average balance held at the federal reserve bank increased by billion to billion in a significant portion of the increase in short term liquidity resulted from cash proceeds from the capital raised in may of synovus expects to continue to maintain a higher level of liquidity in  relative to historical periods  due to the potential for difficult economic and capital market conditions 
the primary factors contributing to the basis point decrease in the effective cost of funds were a basis point decrease in the cost of time deposits and a basis point decrease in the cost of money market accounts 
additional factors contributing to the decrease in the effective cost of funds in include growth in non interest bearing demand deposit accounts  reduced utilization of national market brokered time deposits  and a continued

average non interest demand deposits funded of average total interest earning assets in as compared to during the net interest margin was for  down basis points from the yield on earning assets decreased basis points which was partially offset by a basis point decrease in the effective cost of funds 
yields on investment securities in increased basis points  primarily due to higher realized yields on mortgage backed securities  as compared to the prior year 
loan yields  which decreased basis points  were unfavorably impacted by a basis point decrease in the average prime rate and increased costs to carry elevated levels of non performing assets in as compared to the yield on interest earning assets was also impacted by a higher level of short term liquidity in a significant portion of this liquidity resulted from capital raised in december and september from the issuance of preferred and common stock  respectively  plus the decline in net loans

in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination procedures  periodically review the allowance for loan losses

limited guarantees on a pro rata basis are generally required for all percent or more owners 
synovus evaluates the financial ability of a guarantor through an evaluation of the guarantor s current financial statements  income tax returns for the two most recent years  as well as financial information regarding a guarantor s business or related interests 
in addition  synovus analyzes substantial assets owned by the guarantor to ensure that the guarantor has the necessary ownership or control over these assets 
for loans that are not considered impaired  the allowance for loan losses is determined based on the risk rating of each loan 
the risk rating incorporates a number of factors  including guarantors 
if a loan is rated doubtful  with certain limited exceptions  a guarantee is not considered in determining the amount to be charged off ie  the charge off equals the greater of the amount of the collateral exposure or of the loan balance  in compliance with regulatory requirements 
with the exception of certain loans whose amount is inconsequential  all impaired loans are collateral dependent 
the charge off on these loans is determined based upon the amount of the collateral exposure only 
with certain limited exceptions  synovus seeks performance under guarantees in the event of a borrower s default 
however  under the current economic environment  and based on the fact that a majority of synovus problem credits are commercial real estate credits  synovus success in recovering amounts due under guarantees has been limited 
allocation of the allowance for loan losses table shows a five year comparison of the allocation of the allowance for loan losses

nonaccrual loans consist of those loans on which recognition of interest income has been discontinued 
nonaccrual loans are reduced by the direct application of interest and principal payments to loan principal  for accounting purposes only

loans that are in classified status cannot be considered for an extension under this policy 
extensions or modifications of loans that are in classified status are not an acceptable practice unless done in connection with established and documented workout plans 
a credit may only be extended on this basis one time before the annual renewal review takes place 
loan extensions loan extensions are evaluated for determination as to whether the loan should be accounted for as non performing or troubled debt restructuring

it should be noted that borrowers whose loans are in the category of classified assets are automatically considered to be experiencing financial difficulties 
the determination as to whether the bank has granted a concession is made based on the criteria established in synovus accounting policy 
management  considering current information and events regarding a borrower s ability to repay its obligations  considers a loan to be impaired when the ultimate collectability of all amounts due  according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement  is in doubt 
to date  loan extensions have been primarily within the commercial portfolio and generally consist of brief extensions of maturities in situations where the financial statements  tax returns  or other information required for a loan renewal are not available prior to the existing loan s maturity 
loan extensions have also been made in connection with troubled debt restructurings 
these extensions have generally consisted of extensions of maturities of one year or less 

table of contents accruing tdrs were approximately million at december   compared to million at december  at december  and  the allowance for loan losses allocated to these accruing restructured loans was approximately million and million  respectively 
the increase in accruing restructured loans since the prior year is directly related to the challenges synovus commercial customers continue to face in the current economic environment and synovus efforts to work with creditworthy customers to find solutions that are in the best interest of both the customer and synovus 
restructurings are primarily in the form of extension of terms or reduction in interest rate

table of contents prior to the charter consolidation  a component of synovus deposit growth was through the offering of shared deposit products synovus shared deposit 
the charter consolidation resulted in the inability to offer the shared deposit products in the future 
from the date of completion of the charter consolidation  synovus shared deposit customers had a six month grace period  per fdic regulations  during which their total deposit would remain fully insured 
this grace period expired on december  additionally  during this grace period  shared deposit customers whose cds matured during the grace period could elect to renew their shared cd on a fully insured basis for the same term 
by offering additional deposit products to meet these customers needs  synovus has retained a portion of these funds following the expiration of the grace period 
as of december   remaining shared cd balances were million 
while synovus continues to aggressively pursue retention of shared cd balances at maturity  there can be no assurance that a significant portion of these deposits will remain on deposit at synovus bank 
following the charter consolidation  management developed a strategic plan to diversify synovus funding sources and reduce reliance on volatile funding sources including national market brokered deposits and shared deposit products 
the strategic initiatives implemented by management have and will continue to reduce synovus dependence on national market brokered deposits and shared deposit products primarily through allowing partial runoff of maturing brokered deposits  reducing utilization of brokered money market accounts  reduction of shared deposit balances as the program expires  and maintaining and enhancing local market core deposit base 
as of december   national market brokered and shared deposits combined represented of total deposits 
at december   national market brokered deposits represented of synovus total deposits compared to at december  synovus current level of national market brokered deposits is higher than the average for banking institutions similar to it

alco  operating under liquidity and funding policies approved by the board of directors  actively analyzes contractual and anticipated cash flows in order to properly manage synovus liquidity position 
contractual and anticipated cash flows are analyzed under normal and stressed conditions to determine forward looking liquidity needs and sources 
emphasis is placed on maintaining numerous sources of current and potential liquidity in order for the company to meet its obligations to depositors  borrowers  and creditors on a timely basis 
liquidity is generated through maturities and repayments of loans by customers  maturities of investment securities  deposit growth  and access to sources of funds other than deposits 
management constantly monitors and maintains appropriate levels of liquidity so as to provide adequate funding sources to meet estimated customer deposit withdrawals and future loan requests 
liquidity is also enhanced by the acquisition of new deposits 
each of the banking markets monitors deposit flows and evaluates alternate pricing structures in an effort to retain and grow deposits 
in the current market environment  customer confidence is a critical element in growing and retaining deposits 
in this regard  synovus asset quality could play a larger role in the stability of the deposit base 
in the event asset quality declines significantly from its current level  the ability to grow and retain deposits could be diminished  which in turn could reduce deposits as a liquidity source 
at december   shared cd balances totaled million 
as discussed in the section titled deposits  synovus continues to aggressively pursue retention of shared cd balances at maturity  however  there can be no assurance that a significant portion of these deposits will remain on deposit at synovus bank 
the possibility of this deposit outflow is a potential liquidity risk 
due to this and other liquidity risks  synovus expects to currently maintain an above average short term liquidity cushion  primarily in the form of interest bearing funds with the federal reserve bank 
synovus subsidiary bank  synovus bank  also generates liquidity through the national deposit markets 
synovus bank issues longer term certificates of deposit across a broad geographic base to increase its liquidity and funding position 
access to these deposits could become more limited if synovus bank s asset quality and financial performance were to significantly deteriorate 
synovus bank has the capacity to access funding through its membership in the fhlb system 
at december   synovus bank had access to incremental funding  subject to available collateral and fhlb credit policies  through utilization of fhlb advances 
in addition to bank level liquidity management  synovus must manage liquidity at the holding company level for various operating needs including capital infusions into subsidiaries  the servicing of debt  the payment of general corporate expenses  and the payment of dividends to shareholders 
the primary source of liquidity for synovus consists of dividends from synovus bank which is governed by certain rules and regulations of state and 
table of contents federal banking regulatory agencies 
dividends from subsidiaries in and were significantly lower than those received in previous years 
synovus does not expect to receive subsidiary dividends in the near future 
during  synovus was required to contribute capital to certain subsidiary banks and continued to do so in  including synovus bank following the charter consolidation 
synovus bank is currently required to maintain regulatory capital levels in excess of minimum well capitalized requirements  primarily as a result of non performing asset levels 
due to these requirements  synovus could be required to contribute additional capital to synovus bank  which could adversely affect liquidity at the holding company level 
synovus holding company has historically enjoyed a solid reputation and credit standing in the capital markets and historically has been able to raise funds in the form of either short or long term borrowings or equity issuances  including the public offerings completed in september and may in light of the current regulatory environment  market conditions  synovus recent financial performance and related credit ratings  there can be no assurance that synovus would be able to obtain new borrowings or issue additional equity on favorable terms  if at all 
synovus will continue to identify  consider  and pursue additional strategic initiatives to further strengthen its liquidity position as deemed necessary 
while liquidity is an ongoing challenge for all financial institutions  synovus presently believes that the sources of liquidity discussed above  including existing liquid funds on hand  are sufficient to meet its anticipated funding needs through the near future 
however  if economic conditions or other factors worsen to a greater degree than the assumptions underlying synovus internal financial performance projections or regulatory capital requirements for synovus or its subsidiary bank increase as the result of regulatory directives or otherwise  then synovus may be required to seek additional liquidity from external sources

as a financial holding company  synovus and its subsidiary bank  synovus bank  are required to maintain capital levels required for a well capitalized institution as defined by federal banking regulations 
the capital measures used by the federal banking regulators include the total risk based capital ratio  tier risk based capital ratio  and the leverage ratio 
synovus bank is a state chartered bank under the regulations of the georgia department of banking and finance 
under the regulations  synovus bank is well capitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio of or greater  a tier capital ratio of or greater  a leverage ratio of or greater  and is not subject to any written agreement  order  capital directive  or prompt corrective action directive from a federal and or state banking regulatory agency to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure 
however  even if synovus bank satisfies all applicable quantitative criteria to be considered well capitalized  the regulations also establish procedures for downgrading an institution to a lower capital category based on supervisory factors other than capital 
in june  synovus bank entered into a memorandum of understanding with the fdic and the georgia department of banking and finance agreeing to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of and a minimum total risk based capital to risk weighted assets ratio of 
management believes that  as of december   synovus and synovus bank meet all capital requirements to which they are subject 
economic events which occurred during resulted in a multi year period of economic downturn  including a period from december through june  which has been identified as an economic recession 
since the third quarter of  the credit markets and the residential and commercial development real estate markets have experienced severe difficulties and challenging economic conditions 
as a result  synovus capital has been negatively impacted by elevated credit losses since mid synovus has taken a number of steps focused on strengthening synovus capital position as described below 
however  credit deterioration  further regulatory directives including formal or informal increases in minimum capital requirements at synovus or synovus bank  increases in non performing assets  losses related to asset dispositions  and the allowance for loan losses significantly 
table of contents exceeding current expectations could adversely impact synovus liquidity position and capital ratios 
accordingly  synovus continues to actively monitor its capital position and will pursue additional strategies designed to bolster its capital position as deemed necessary

table of contents synovus continually monitors its capital position  particularly as capital is impacted by current credit conditions  economic conditions and regulatory requirements  and engages in regular discussions with its regulators regarding capital at both synovus and synovus bank 
during and continuing into  synovus experienced significant declines in the value of collateral for real estate loans and heightened credit losses  which resulted in record levels of non performing assets  charge offs  foreclosures  and losses on disposition of distressed assets 
while these levels continue to remain high  overall indicators of negative credit quality migration have begun to improve  however  it is difficult to predict the effects of any further potential negative developments in the credit  economic  and regulatory environments which could cause these levels to worsen or delay their improvement 
management currently believes  based on current internal capital analyses and earnings projections  that synovus capital position is adequate to meet current regulatory minimum capital requirements 
however  synovus continues to actively monitor economic conditions  evolving industry capital standards  and changes in regulatory standards and requirements 
and  as part of its ongoing management of capital  synovus will continue to identify  consider  and pursue additional strategic initiatives to bolster its capital position as deemed necessary

however  recently filed federal refund claims are being reviewed by the irs 
there are also certain state income tax examinations currently in progress 
although synovus is unable to determine the ultimate outcome of these examinations  synovus believes that current income tax accruals are adequate for any uncertain income tax positions relating to these jurisdictions 
inflation a financial institution s assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature  therefore  inflation can have an important impact on the growth of total assets in the banking industry and may create a need to increase equity capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain appropriate capital ratios 
interest rate levels are also significantly influenced by changes in the rate of inflation although they do not necessarily change at the same time or magnitude as the inflation rate 
these changes could adversely impact synovus financial position and profitability 
synovus attempts to mitigate the effects of inflation and changing interest rates by managing its interest rate sensitivity position through its asset liability management practices and by periodically adjusting its pricing of services and banking products in an effort to take into consideration such costs 
see market risk and interest rate sensitivity herein 
deflation an extended period of deflation could negatively impact the banking industry and may be associated with lower growth and a general deterioration of the economy 
such a scenario could impair bank earnings and profitability in a variety of ways including  but not limited to  decreases in the value of collateral for loans  a diminished ability of borrowers to service their debts  increases in the value of certain bank liabilities  and lessened demand for loans 
while these effects cannot be fully accounted for  synovus attempts to mitigate such risks through prudent underwriting of loans and through the management of its interest rate sensitivity position

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk and interest rate sensitivity market risk reflects the risk of economic loss resulting from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
this risk of loss can be reflected in either diminished current market values or reduced current and potential net income 
synovus most significant market risk is interest rate risk 
this risk arises primarily from synovus core community banking activities of extending loans and accepting deposits 
managing interest rate risk is a primary goal of the asset liability management function 
synovus attempts to achieve consistency in net interest income while limiting volatility arising from changes in interest rates 
synovus seeks to accomplish this goal by balancing the maturity and repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities along with the selective use of derivative instruments 
synovus manages its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates through policies established by alco and approved by the board of directors 
alco meets periodically and has responsibility for developing asset liability management policies  reviewing the interest rate sensitivity of synovus  and developing and implementing strategies to improve balance sheet structure and interest rate risk positioning 
simulation modeling is the primary tool used by synovus to measure its interest rate sensitivity 
on at least a quarterly basis  the following twenty four month time period is simulated to determine a baseline net interest income forecast and the sensitivity of this forecast to changes in interest rates 
the baseline forecast assumes an unchanged or flat interest rate environment 
these simulations include all of synovus earning assets  liabilities  and derivative instruments 
forecasted balance sheet changes  primarily reflecting loan and deposit growth expectations  are included in the periods modeled 
projected rates for new loans and deposits are based on management s outlook and local market conditions 
the magnitude and velocity of rate changes among the various asset and liability groups exhibit different characteristics for each possible interest rate scenario  additionally  customer loan and deposit preferences can vary in response to changing interest rates 
simulation modeling enables synovus to capture the effect of these differences 
synovus is also able to model expected changes in the shape of interest rate yield curves for each rate scenario 
simulation also enables synovus to capture the effect of expected prepayment level changes on selected assets and liabilities subject to prepayment 
synovus rate sensitivity position is indicated by selected results of net interest income simulations 
in these simulations  synovus has modeled the impact of a gradual increase in short term interest rates of and basis points to determine the sensitivity of net interest income for the next twelve months 
due to short term interest rates being at or near at this time  only rising rate scenarios have been modeled 
as illustrated in table  the net interest income sensitivity model indicates that  compared with a net interest income forecast assuming stable rates  net interest income is projected to increase by and increase by if interest rates increased by and basis points  respectively 
these changes were within synovus policy limit of a maximum negative change 

table of contents the measured interest rate sensitivity indicates a moderately asset sensitive position over the next twelve months  which could serve to improve net interest income in a rising interest rate environment 
the actual realized change in net interest income would depend on several factors  which could also serve to diminish  or eliminate the asset sensitivity noted above 
market conditions and their resulting impact on loan  deposit  and wholesale funding pricing would be a primary risk to the interest rate sensitivity and a primary determinant in the realized level of net interest income 
more specifically  higher than projected pressure on deposit pricing due to market competition  or a greater than projected rate of customer migration to higher cost deposits  such as certificates of deposit  could negatively impact realized net interest income 
synovus is also subject to market risk in certain of its fee income business lines 
financial management services revenues  which include trust  brokerage  and financial planning fees  can be affected by risk in the securities markets  primarily the equity securities market 
a significant portion of the fees in this unit are determined based upon a percentage of asset values 
weaker securities markets and lower equity values have an adverse impact on the fees generated by these operations 
mortgage banking income is also subject to market risk 
mortgage loan originations are sensitive to levels of mortgage interest rates and therefore  mortgage revenue could be negatively impacted during a period of rising interest rates 
the extension of commitments to customers to fund mortgage loans also subjects synovus to market risk 
this risk is primarily created by the time period between making the commitment and closing and delivering the loan 
synovus seeks to minimize this exposure by utilizing various risk management tools  the primary of which are forward sales commitments and best efforts commitments 
table twelve month net interest income sensitivity change in short term interest rates in basis points estimated change in net interest income as of december  flat derivative instruments for interest rate risk management as part of its overall interest rate risk management activities  synovus utilizes derivative instruments to manage its exposure to various types of interest rate risks 
these instruments are in the form of interest rate swaps where synovus receives a fixed rate of interest and pays a floating rate tied to either the prime rate or libor 
these swaps are utilized to hedge the variability of cash flows or fair values of on balance sheet assets and liabilities 
interest rate derivative contracts utilized by synovus include end user hedges  all of which are designated as hedging specific assets or liabilities 
these hedges are executed and managed in coordination with the overall interest rate risk management function 
management believes that the utilization of these instruments provides greater financial flexibility and efficiency in managing interest rate risk 

table of contents the notional amount of interest rate swap contracts utilized by synovus as part of its overall interest rate risk management activities as of december  and was million and million  respectively 
the notional amounts represent the amount on which calculations of interest payments to be exchanged are based 
entering into interest rate derivatives contracts potentially exposes synovus to the risk of counterparties failure to fulfill their legal obligations including  but not limited to  potential amounts due or payable under each derivative contract 
this credit risk is normally a small percentage of the notional amount and fluctuates based on changes in interest rates 
synovus analyzes and approves credit risk for all potential derivative counterparties prior to execution of any derivative transaction 
synovus assesses the ongoing credit risk of its dealer counterparties by regularly monitoring publicly available credit rating information and other market indicators 
synovus seeks to limit credit risk by dealing with highly rated counterparties and by obtaining collateralization for exposures above certain predetermined limits
