our annual report on form k  quarterly reports on form q and current reports on form k  as well as any amendments or exhibits to those reports  are available free of charge through our website as soon as reasonably practicable after we file them with the securities and exchange commission 
current year results the company reported net income of million  or per diluted share for the year ended december  this compared with net income of million  or per diluted share for the year ended december  critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies that we believe are the most critical in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results are the following revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from services rendered once all the following criteria for revenue recognition have been met persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  the services have been rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collection of the amounts due is reasonably assured 
we also determine whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of product sales and related costs or the net amount earned as net revenue 
we typically are the seller and merchant of record on most of the transactions we process and have contractual relationships with our clients  which obligate us to pay to the client a specified percentage of each sale 
we derive our revenue primarily from transaction fees based on a percentage of the products sale price and fees from services rendered associated with the e commerce and other services provided to our clients and end customers 
our revenue is recorded net as generally our clients are subject to inventory risks and control customers product choices 
we sell both physical and digital products 
revenue is recognized upon fulfillment and based upon when products are shipped and title and significant risk of ownership passes to the customer 
the company also provides customers with various proprietary software backup services 
we recognize revenue for these backup services based upon historical usage within the contract period of the digital backup services when this information is available 
digital backup services are recognized straight line 
table of contents over the life of the backup service when historical usage information is unavailable 
shipping revenues are recorded net of any associated costs 
we also  to a lesser extent  provide fee based client services  which include website design  custom development and integration  analytical marketing  affiliate marketing and email marketing services 
if we receive payments for fee based services in advance of delivery  these amounts  if significant  are deferred and recognized over the service period 
provisions for doubtful accounts and transaction losses and authorized credits are made at the time of revenue recognition based upon our historical experience 
the provision for doubtful accounts and transaction losses are recorded as charges to operating expense  while the provision for authorized credits is recognized as a reduction of net revenues 
taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are directly imposed on a revenue producing transaction between a seller and a customer may be presented on either a gross basis included in revenues and costs or on a net basis excluded from revenues 
the company presents these taxes on a net basis in its financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we must make estimates and assumptions that can affect the amount of assets and liabilities and the amounts of revenues and expenses we report in any financial reporting period 
we use estimates in determining our allowance for doubtful accounts which are based on our historical experience and current trends 
we must estimate the collectability of our billed accounts receivable 
we analyze accounts receivable and consider our historical bad debt experience  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we must make significant judgments and estimates in connection with the allowance in any accounting period 
there may be material differences in our operating results for any period if we change our estimates or if the estimates are not accurate 
credit card chargeback reserve 
we use estimates based on historical experience and current trends to determine accrued chargeback expenses 
significant management judgments are used and estimates made in connection with these expenses in any accounting period 
the following table illustrates our provision for chargeback losses as a percentage of revenue for  and in thousands  except percentages revenue provision for credit card chargebacks provision for credit card chargebacks as a of revenue determining appropriate reserves for chargeback transactions is an inherently uncertain process 
the reserves are maintained at a level we deem appropriate to provide for losses incurred on revenue earned in there may be material differences in our operating results for any period if we change our estimates or if the estimates are not accurate 
an aggregate deviation in our estimates would have resulted in an increase or decrease in operating income of approximately million in  resulting in an approximate change in diluted net income per share 
goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets 
we depreciate property  plant and equipment  amortize certain intangibles and certain other long lived assets with definite lives over their useful lives 
useful lives are based on our estimates of the period of time over which the assets will generate revenue or benefit our business 
we review assets with definite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value we are carrying on our financial statements for an asset may not be recoverable 
our evaluation considers non financial data such as changes in the operating environment and business strategy  competitive information  market trends and operating performance 
we review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
as we only have one business segment  goodwill is evaluated for impairment by comparing our carrying value to our market capitalization  which is determined to approximate fair value 
if there are indications 
table of contents that impairment may be necessary  we use an undiscounted cash flow analysis to determine the impairment amount  if any 
assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if there are indications that an impairment may be necessary utilizing a two step approach 
there have been no material impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets for the years  and income taxes and deferred taxes 
deferred income taxes reflect the tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
we record deferred tax assets for favorable tax attributes  including tax loss carryforwards 
we currently have us tax loss carryforwards  consisting solely of acquired operating tax loss carryforwards  and a lesser amount of acquired foreign operating tax loss carryforwards 
a portion of the benefit of the acquired tax loss carryforwards has been reserved by a valuation allowance pursuant to us gaap 
these valuation allowances of the deferred tax asset will be reversed if and when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized 
we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance of the deferred tax asset on a quarterly basis 
any future release of valuation allowance will reduce income tax expense 
as of december   we had us tax loss carryforwards of approximately million and foreign tax loss carryforwards of million 
all of the us tax loss carryforwards consist of acquired net operating losses and million of the foreign tax loss carryforwards are acquired net operating losses 
the us tax loss carryforwards expire in the years through however  we anticipate most us tax loss carryforwards will be utilized in the next few years 
there is uncertainty of future realization of the deferred tax assets resulting from tax loss carryforwards due to anticipated limitations 
therefore  a valuation allowance was recorded against the tax effect of such tax loss carryforwards 
during  the company released million of valuation allowance recorded on its acquired foreign tax loss carryforwards because we believe it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized 
this reduction in the valuation allowance reduced tax expense 
the company also recorded million of valuation allowance on tax loss carryforwards and other tax attributes because we believe it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not be realized 
at december   the company has a valuation allowance on approximately million of deferred tax assets related to operating losses as we believe it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not be realized 
any future release of this valuation allowance will reduce income tax expense 
during  we repatriated approximately million of earnings from our german subsidiary  resulting in a us tax benefit driven by the generation of excess foreign tax credits 
this was a one time distribution as we plan to indefinitely reinvest all remaining foreign earnings 
no provision has been made for federal income taxes on approximately million of our foreign subsidiaries undistributed earnings as of december   since we plan to indefinitely reinvest all such earnings 
if these earnings were distributed to the us in the form of dividends or otherwise  we would be subject to us income taxes on such earnings 
the amount of us income taxes would be subject to adjustment for foreign tax credits and for the impact of the step up in the basis of assets resulting from elections made at the time of acquisitions 
if these earnings were to be distributed  the income tax liability would be approximately million 
stock based compensation expense 
we account for share based payments made to our employees and directors including stock options  restricted stock grants and employee stock purchases made through our employee stock purchase plan based on estimated fair values 
stock based compensation expense recognized during the period is based on the value of the portion of share based awards that are ultimately expected to vest during the period 
the fair value of each stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the fair value of restricted stock is determined based on the number of shares granted and the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant 
compensation expense for all share based payment awards is recognized over the requisite service period 

table of contents as stock based compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statements of operations is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized stock based compensation expense are reported as a financing cash flow 
stock based compensation expense of million  million and million was charged to operating expenses during  and  respectively

therefore  these items are not included in the table 
uncertain income tax position liabilities of million are not included in the table because we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with the respective tax authorities
