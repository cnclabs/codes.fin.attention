item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations for the two years ended december  general overview our products are sold primarily into the electronics assembly  photovoltaic solar cell manufacturing  semiconductor dram and flash memory  and semiconductor fabrication capital equipment markets  where we sell products both to original equipment manufacturers of production equipment and to end user customers that produce circuit boards  solar cells and semiconductor wafers and devices 
historically these markets have been very cyclical  with periods of rapid growth as worldwide capacity is added to support increased consumer demand for electronic products  and new capital equipment is purchased as a result of technology changes in electronics components  such as miniaturization  and changing production requirements 
these periods of growth have historically been followed by periods of excess capacity and reduced capital spending 
our results were favorably impacted in and as the worldwide demand for cell phones  smart phones  laptops and other consumer electronics remained strong  driving the need for increased production of printed circuit boards and memory modules  and thereby increasing demand for our electronic assembly and semiconductor products 
after peaking in the third quarter of  our revenue declined sequentially each quarter through the first quarter of  as our results were negatively impacted by reduced levels of capital spending for electronics manufacturing capacity brought about by the deepening weakness in the global economy 
new orders dropped off sharply late in the fourth quarter of as the global economy fell into a severe recession  and our results for were adversely affected by the ongoing weakness in the global electronics market 
even before the recession  we worked to improve the efficiencies of our operations 
in february  we commenced plans to move a significant portion of our systems related product development and final assembly and integration to singapore 
the transition of these functions to singapore was substantially complete by the end of the first quarter of and has resulted in lower costs and a more focused r d effort 
further  we consolidated manufacturing operations for our semiconductor products into our minneapolis  minnesota headquarters facility 
implementation of these actions to improve the efficiency of our operations has not impacted any of our strategic growth programs 
we believe that continued and timely development of new products and enhancements to existing products is essential to growing our position in the market 
we commit substantial resources to research and development efforts  which play a critical role in maintaining and advancing our position as a leading provider of optical sensors and systems 
the global electronics market strengthened significantly in we experienced particularly strong demand in the second quarter of  as pent up demand and an improving economy led to significantly increased sales of alignment sensors and our stand alone solder paste inspection and aoi systems 
sales of sensors continued at these strong levels throughout the remainder of  while systems sales moderated to more normal levels 
we believe that i improving market conditions  ii the efficiencies in operations we have implemented  iii the new products we have introduced and expect to introduce in the next year  which we anticipate will generate significant sales and improved margins  and will allow us to address the various price points desired by our customers within the electronic assembly market and iv the greater efficiencies we are realizing through our strategic repositioning in asia  will lead to improved operating results in and future periods 

table of contents segment results our business consists of two operating segments  the electronic assembly and semiconductor segments 
in the electronic assembly segment we design  manufacture and sell optical process control sensors and inspection systems for the electronic assembly and photovoltaic solar cell equipment markets 
in the semiconductor segment we design  manufacture and sell optical and other process control sensors and related equipment for the semiconductor capital equipment market 
segment information follows year ended december  in thousands revenue electronic assembly semiconductor total gross margin electronic assembly semiconductor total operating expense electronic assembly semiconductor total income loss from operations electronic assembly semiconductor total income loss from operations interest income and other income loss before income taxes revenues our revenues increased by to million in from million in and decreased by in from million in the following table sets forth  for the years indicated  revenues by product line in thousands electronic assembly alignment sensors smt inspection systems total electronic assembly semiconductor total electronic assembly revenue from sales of our alignment sensors increased by to million in  up from million in revenue from sales of our stand alone smt inspection systems products increased by or million to million in  up from million in revenue from sales of alignment sensors decreased by million or in  down from million in revenue from sales of our smt inspection systems products decreased by million or in  down from million in 
table of contents the global recession caused severe weakness and disruption in our electronics markets starting late in and throughout all of  resulting in very low levels of revenue in from both our alignment sensors and stand alone smt inspection systems products 
the global electronics market strengthened in  returning to more normalized levels of equipment purchases and production capacity additions 
we believe that improved market conditions  combined with favorable market acceptance of the new products we have recently introduced  resulted in the higher revenue levels in compared to the same periods of our revenue in benefited from initial shipment of solar wafer alignment cameras to dek  an equipment manufacturer for the photovoltaic cell market 
in addition to continued sales of our se solder paste inspection spi system  we recorded solid sales of our new se spi system that was introduced in the first quarter of  and our new qx automated optical inspection aoi system that was introduced in the second quarter of sales of our se  se and se ultra solder paste inspection systems increased by over to million in from million in our sales of qx and flex ultra aoi system products increased by to million in  up from million in sales of our inspection system products were negatively impacted in by the severe global economic recession 
sales of our se ultra and se solder paste inspection systems decreased by million or in to million  while sales of our flex aoi systems decreased by million or in to million 
we believe that ongoing introduction of new system products  including those accommodating dual production lanes  bigger circuit boards and addressing different tiers of the market  will strengthen our competitive position in the inspection market 
unlike revenue from our alignment sensors  which is closely tied to the need for added production capacity for printed circuit boards  a portion of our stand alone smt systems revenue is derived from the retro fit of existing production lines as companies seek to improve their production yields  thereby reducing manufacturing costs 
we believe that these new products  and technology trends toward smaller components and increased production speeds  will contribute to increased demand and higher revenue in export revenue from alignment sensors and smt inspection systems totaled million or of electronic assembly revenue in  compared to million or of electronic assembly revenue in sales to international customers continue to be significant  as manufacturing of electronic components has migrated offshore  particularly to china and other areas of asia 
semiconductor revenues from sales of our semiconductor products increased by to million in  up from million in the increase in revenue in was due to improving conditions in the market for semiconductor fabrication equipment resulting from the better economic environment  coupled with favorable market acceptance of our new wafersense products 
revenues from sales of our semiconductor products decreased by or million in to million  down from million in the decrease in revenue in was due to the recession  difficult conditions in the market for semiconductor fabrication equipment and declining revenue from our older wafer mapper and frame grabber products 
we anticipate that future growth in our semiconductor revenues  exclusive of changes related to capital procurement cycles will come from our new wafersense products  a family of wireless  wafer like precision measurement tools for in situ setup  calibration and process optimization in semiconductor processing equipment 
we have introduced a number of new wafersense products in recent years  including various leveling  gapping  teaching and vibration sensors 
we anticipate formal introduction of our new particle sensor in the first half of wafersense revenue increased by over to million in from million in  after remaining virtually unchanged in compared to export revenue from semiconductor products totaled million or of revenue in  compared to million or of revenue in and million or of semiconductor revenue in the increase in the percentage of sales coming from exports for our semiconductor products in reflects proportionately higher wafersense revenue  as these products tend to have a higher concentration of international sales 
the percentage of sales coming from international markets decreased in due to a large proportional decrease in sales of frame grabber products  which tend to generate significant international sales 

table of contents cost of revenue and gross margin electronic assembly cost of revenue for our electronic assembly segment increased by to million in  after decreasing to million in  from million in the increase in cost of revenue in was due to the significantly higher sales in  while the decrease in cost of revenue in was due to the significantly lower sales in compared to cost of revenue items fluctuating with the level of sales include raw materials  direct labor and some factory overhead costs 
gross margin as a percentage of electronic assembly sales was in  compared to in and in the improvement in gross margin percentage in was due to significantly increased sales of higher margin alignment sensors  better manufacturing leverage resulting from substantially higher production volumes over which to spread fixed manufacturing overhead costs  the favorable impact of cost reduction programs and our new cost reduced smt inspection system products 
our next generation se and new mid range se solder paste inspection systems  and our new qx automated optical inspection aoi system are significantly cost reduced when compared to our earlier generation inspection system products 
the electronic assembly market is highly price competitive  resulting in continual pressure on our gross margins 
we compensate for pricing pressure by introducing new products with more features and improved performance and through manufacturing cost reduction programs 
for example  we believe our next generation se and se solder paste inspection systems and qx automated optical inspection aoi system combines a reduction in cost with enhanced performance 
other recently introduced products including our solar wafer alignment camera  embedded process verification epv technology and the embedded solder paste inspection solution we developed for dek  have more favorable margins than our existing products 
the reduction in gross margin percentage in compared to was due to significantly lower sales of higher margin alignment sensors  substantially lower production volumes over which to spread fixed manufacturing overhead costs  continued competitive pricing pressure for our products  particularly older generation versions that are being replaced  and the overall impact of the global recession 
semiconductor cost of revenue for our semiconductor segment increased by to million in  after decreasing by to million in  from million in the increase in cost of revenue in was due to the significantly higher sales in  while the decrease in cost of revenue in was due to the significantly lower sales in compared to gross margin as a percentage of semiconductor sales was in  compared to in and in gross margin as a percentage of semiconductor sales improved in and due to the cost benefit from consolidation of manufacturing for our semiconductor products into our minneapolis  minnesota headquarters  increased sales of higher margin wafersense products and from improved manufacturing leverage  resulting from higher production volumes over which to spread fixed manufacturing overhead costs 
operating expenses we believe continued investment in research and development of new products  coupled with continued investment in and development of our sales channel is critical to future growth and profitability 
we historically have maintained research and development and sales and marketing expenses at relatively high levels  even during periods of recession and downturn in our electronic assembly and semiconductor capital equipment markets  as we continue to fund development of important new products  and continue to invest in our sales channels and develop new sales territories 
in february  we announced plans to move to singapore a significant portion of our systems related product development and final assembly and integration 
the transition of systems related product development to singapore was substantially complete by the end of the fourth quarter of and the transition of final assembly and integration for our system products was substantially complete by the end of the first quarter of the realignment of our systems related product development and final assembly and integration to singapore has resulted in lower costs and a more focused development effort 
in response to the significant weakness in our markets and the global economy we reduced our research and development  selling  general and administrative workforce by approximately employees from the start of the fourth quarter of through the end of the second quarter of other cost saving measures implemented in include salary reductions and reduced spending for non labor costs such as travel  supplies and the like 
these cost saving measures  combined with savings from our transition to singapore  provided significant annual expense savings 
implementation of the cost reduction actions discussed above had no impact on any of our strategic growth programs  work on our common hardware platforms for inspection  next generation inspection technologies  or pursuit of new oem contracts 

table of contents due to the improving economy  we elected to restore salary levels for our employees to pre reduction levels in we have also added headcount  including temporary labor  since january  and anticipate that there will be other headcount additions  and costs will increase as business activity picks up and revenue returns to pre recession levels 
however  many of the cost savings measures that were put in place during and will continue to provide meaningful savings for the foreseeable future 
electronic assembly research and development expenses for our electronic assembly segment were million or of revenue in  million or of revenue in and million or of revenue in the increase in research and development expenses in compared to was due to the restoration of pay for our employees to levels prior to the pay cut in  higher costs for proto type materials related to new product development and the addition of several new employees to assist with ongoing development efforts 
the decrease in research and development expenses in compared to resulted from a more focused and efficient research and development effort due to transition of systems related research and development to singapore  as well as transition costs incurred in throughout most of  we maintained our minneapolis based systems development team while we trained our new singapore based team  resulting in extra costs for wages  training  travel  and other costs  during the initial start up and training period 
singapore transition costs classified as research and development expense in were  no transition costs were incurred in in addition  the cost reduction actions implemented in november and february contributed to the lower level of spending in we expect research and development expenses to increase in as we continue to focus on new products  including new stand alone inspection offerings based on our industry leading d solder paste inspection technology  d inspection technology based on our strobe inspection module sim  and new embedded inspection solutions for both solder paste and automated optical inspection 
selling  general and administrative expenses for our electronic assembly segment were million or of revenue in  compared to million or of revenue in and million or of revenue in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in reflect higher sales and marketing costs  including commissions for third party sales representatives resulting from higher levels of smt inspection system sales  higher incentive compensation costs due  in part  to our improved financial performance  partially offset by lower expense for doubtful accounts 
selling  general and administrative expenses for include an  provision for doubtful accounts related to a key distributor of our smt inspection systems products 
the distributor remains in business  and is committed to paying us the amount owed 
the increase in the provision for doubtful accounts in was more than offset by reductions in expense from our cost savings measures  reductions in travel costs  lower commissions for third party sales representatives resulting from the lower level of smt inspection systems sales in compared to and lower foreign sales office expenses resulting from favorable foreign exchange rates 
semiconductor research and development expenses for our semiconductor segment were million or of revenue in  million or of revenue in  and million or of revenue in the decline in research and development expenses in resulted from the cost reduction actions that were implemented in november and february  offset in part by a small increase in expense for abandoned patents 
research and development for our semiconductor products remain focused on our wafersense family of precision measurement tools  including new automated leveling  gapping  teaching  vibration and particle sensors to assist with process optimization and yield improvement in the semiconductor fabrication process 
selling  general and administrative expenses for our semiconductor segment were million or of revenue in  million or of revenue in and million or of revenue in the increase in reflects higher third party commission payments attributable to the higher level of sales 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expense in compared to was due to lower salary and consulting costs  and lower sales commissions resulting from the reduced level of revenue 
severance  recruitment and singapore transition the transition of a significant portion of development and final assembly and integration for our systems products to singapore was substantially complete by the end of the first quarter of severance costs incurred in connection with the february decision to move our systems related product development and final assembly and integration to singapore related entirely to our electronic assembly segment and totaled  in in february  we further reduced our workforce by positions in response to the weakening global economy  our transition to singapore and our decision to consolidate manufacturing for our semiconductor products in our minneapolis facility 
severance costs incurred in connection with the february workforce reduction totaled  in  of which  related to our electronic assembly segment and  related to our semiconductor segment 

table of contents all of the severance costs related to the singapore transition  and the february workforce reduction have been classified as severance in our statement of operations 
all of the aforementioned severance costs incurred in were paid prior to december  no severance costs were incurred interest income and other interest income and other includes interest earned on investments  realized gains and losses from sales of investments and gains and losses associated with foreign currency transactions 
interest income and other decreased in and due to lower rates of interest earned on invested funds and lower invested balances of cash and marketable securities resulting from significant repurchases of our common stock in totaling million 
we incurred foreign currency transaction gains  net of underlying currency hedges of  in  compared to foreign currency transaction losses  net of underlying currency hedges  of  in and  in income taxes we recorded income tax expense of  in  reflecting an effective tax rate of  compared to an income tax benefit of million in  reflecting an effective income tax benefit rate of 
our effective tax rate for reflects the benefit of having a significant portion of our operations in singapore where corporate income tax rates are substantially lower than the united states 
lower tax rates in foreign jurisdictions favorably impacted our income tax rate by 
other items favorably impacting our income tax rate in include small benefits from federal and state research and experimentation r d tax credits 
our effective tax rate for was favorably impacted by or  from settlement of internal revenue service audits of our and federal income tax returns  including both the impact of settlement payments and reversal of a portion of our reserve for income taxes 
other items impacting our effective rate in include a small benefit from the research and experimentation r d tax credit  offset by higher tax expense in foreign tax jurisdictions with tax rates differing from the u 
s federal statutory rate 
we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction  and various state and foreign jurisdictions 
during  the internal revenue service completed audits of our and federal income tax returns 
our settlement with the internal revenue service did not have a material impact on our financial condition 
we are no longer subject to state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before due to the carryback of our federal taxable loss to taxable years  the internal revenue service could potentially examine our federal income tax returns for those years 
the statute of limitations for examination of these returns had previously expired 
we received federal income tax refunds in of approximately million from carry back of our federal taxable loss 
liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents increased by million during due to proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities  net of purchases of million  cash provided by operating activities of million  proceeds from exercise of stock options and issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan of  offset in part by capital expenditures of million 
our cash and cash equivalents fluctuate in part because of maturities of marketable securities  and investment of cash balances in marketable securities  or from other sources of cash  in addition to marketable securities 
accordingly  we believe the combined balances of cash and marketable securities provide a more reliable indication of our available liquidity 
combined balances of cash and marketable securities increased slightly to million as of december   up from million as of december  operating activities generated million of cash in cash provided by operations included net income of million  which included non cash expenses totaling million for depreciation and amortization  provision for doubtful accounts  deferred taxes  non cash gains and losses from foreign currency transactions and stock compensation costs 

table of contents changes in operating assets and liabilities using cash included increases in accounts receivable of million and inventories of million 
changes in operating assets and liabilities providing cash included increases in accounts payable of million  accrued expenses and other liabilities of million  advance customer payments of  and decreases in income tax refunds receivable of million 
the increase in accounts receivable and advance customer payments was due to higher sales levels in the fourth quarter of  compared to the fourth quarter of inventories were higher due to increased material purchases to support the higher level of sales expected in the second half of and early in the increase in accounts payable resulted from increased material purchases and a conscious effort on our part to extend the timing of vendor payments 
accrued expenses and other liabilities increased due to higher warranty  commission and incentive compensation accruals  resulting from higher sales levels and improved operating results 
income tax refunds receivable decreased due to receipt of our anticipated tax refund resulting from carryback of our net operating loss to prior periods 
we used million of cash for operating activities in cash used for operations included our net loss of million  which included non cash expenses totaling million for depreciation and amortization  provision for doubtful accounts  deferred taxes  non cash gains and losses from foreign currency transactions  gain and loss activity from marketable securities and stock compensation expenses 
changes in operating assets and liabilities using cash included increases in accounts receivable of million and income tax refunds receivable of  and decreases in accrued expenses of million 
changes in operating assets and liabilities providing cash included decreases in inventories of million and increases in accounts payable of  the increase in accounts receivable was due to higher sales levels in the fourth quarter of  compared to the fourth quarter of income tax refunds receivable were higher due to anticipated income tax refunds resulting from carry back of our taxable loss to earlier periods 
the decrease in accrued expenses resulted from lower levels of income tax reserves resulting from settlement of internal revenue service audits of our and federal income tax returns  lower warranty accruals resulting from the lower level of sales in and payment of accrued severance 
inventories were lower due to reduced material purchases in response to sharply lower sales levels early in and the increase in sales in the latter half of the year 
accounts payable were higher due to the timing of inventory purchases and a conscious effort on our part to extend the timing of vendor payments 
investing activities provided million of cash in compared to providing million of cash in changes in the level of investment in marketable securities  resulting from the purchases  sales and maturities of those securities generated million of cash in and million of cash in we used million of cash in and million of cash in for the purchase of fixed assets and capitalized patent costs 
financing activities provided  of cash in compared to providing  of cash in  all from the exercise of employee stock options and issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
at december   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of establishing off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
we do not believe we are exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
except for our obligations under facilities leases and purchase contracts  we had no material commitments for expenditures as of december  purchase commitments for inventory can vary based on the volume of revenue and resulting inventory requirements 
while there were no material commitments  we evaluate investment opportunities that come to our attention and could make a significant commitment in the future 
the following summarizes our contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
december  in s total less than year years after years contractual obligations non cancelable operating lease obligations purchase obligations reserve for income taxes total contractual cash obligations we lease a  square foot mixed office and warehouse facility built to our specifications in golden valley  minnesota  which functions as our corporate headquarters and primary manufacturing facility for our sensor products  including the sensors used in our stand alone systems products and our semiconductor products 
we are close to finalizing a lease amendment for this facility that will become effective upon the june  expiration of the existing lease 
the amendment provides that we will lease approximately  square feet of the current facility  commencing on july  and continuing through december  future minimum lease payments due under the lease amendment from july  through december  are approximately million 

table of contents purchase obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding 
included in the purchase obligations category above are obligations related to purchase orders for inventory purchases under our standard terms and conditions and under negotiated agreements with vendors and utilities 
we expect to receive consideration products or services for these purchase obligations 
the purchase obligation amounts do not represent all anticipated purchases in the future  but represent only those items for which we are contractually obligated 
the majority of our products and services are purchased as needed  with no contractual commitment 
consequently  these amounts will not provide a reliable indicator of our expected future cash outflows on a stand alone basis 
our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled million at december  we believe that on hand cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  coupled with anticipated future cash flow from operations  will be adequate to fund our cash flow needs for the foreseeable future  including contractual obligations discussed above 
related party transactions we did not engage in any related party transactions during the three year period ended december  inflation and foreign currency transactions changes in our revenues have resulted primarily because of changes in the level of unit shipments and the relative strength of the worldwide electronics and semiconductor fabrication capital equipment markets 
we believe that inflation has not had a significant effect on our operations 
virtually all of our international export sales are negotiated  invoiced and paid in us dollars 
accordingly  although currency fluctuations do not significantly affect our revenue per unit  they can influence the price competitiveness of our products and the willingness of existing and potential customers to purchase units 
a significant portion of our cost of goods  research and development and sales and marketing costs are denominated in singapore dollars 
in addition  other sales and marketing costs are denominated in british pounds sterling and the chinese yuan  resulting from our sales offices located in the uk and china 
our costs will increase  and our results will be negatively impacted in future periods  when the us dollar weakens relative to the currencies of the foreign countries where we have operations 
our costs in us dollar terms will decrease and our results will be favorably impacted in future periods when the us dollar strengthens relative to the currencies of those countries where we have operations 
we enter into foreign currency swap agreements to hedge short term inter company financing transactions with our subsidiaries in the united kingdom and singapore 
these currency swap agreements are structured to mature near the last day of each quarter  and are designated as cash flow hedges 
at december   we had two open swap agreements that were purchased on that day 
recent accounting developments in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb amended guidance in fasb accounting standards codification tm asc  revenue recognition   multiple element arrangements  to modify the separation criteria by eliminating the criterion that requires objective and reliable evidence of fair value for the undelivered item s  and eliminates the use of the residual method of allocation and instead requires that arrangement consideration be allocated  at the inception of the arrangement  to all deliverables based on their relative selling price 
the fasb also issued guidance to amend the scope of asc  software   revenue recognition  to exclude arrangements with tangible products containing both software and non software components that function together to deliver a product s essential functionality 
under the amended guidance  consideration is allocated to the deliverables at inception of an arrangement using the relative selling price method 
selling price is determined based on a selling price hierarchy  consisting of vsoe  third party evidence or estimated selling price 
under the amended guidance  we determined an estimated selling price for each of the elements in our multiple elements sales based on the selling price hierarchy and allocated consideration to the deliverables using the relative selling price method 
we have adopted the amended guidance effective january  the impact of adopting the amended guidance was not material to our recognition of revenue in and would have been insignificant in 
table of contents in january  the fasb issued asu no 
 fair value measurements and disclosures topic improving disclosures about fair value measurements asu no 

asu no 
requires new disclosures regarding significant transfers in and out of levels and  as well as information about activity in level fair value measurements  including presenting information about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements on a gross versus a net basis in the level activity roll forward 
in addition  asu no 
clarifies existing disclosures regarding input and valuation techniques  as well as the level of disaggregation for each class of assets and liabilities 
asu no 
is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december   except for the disclosures pertaining to purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the roll forward of level activity  those disclosures are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  our adoption of asu no 
effective january  had no current impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  warranty obligations  inventory valuation  intangible assets  and income taxes 
we base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the estimates and judgments that we believe have the most effect on our reported financial position and results of operations are as follows revenue recognition 
revenue from all customers  including distributors  is recognized when all significant contractual obligations have been satisfied and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
generally  revenues are recognized upon shipment under fob shipping point terms  and include shipping and handling costs 
estimated returns and warranty costs are recorded at the time of sale 
sales of some surface mount technology smt systems products may require customer acceptance due to performance or other acceptance criteria included in the terms of sale 
for these smt product sales  revenue is recognized at the time of customer acceptance 
our multiple deliverable arrangements typically include the sale of an smt inspection system  installation and training  and in some cases  an extended warranty 
revenue from installation and training and extended warranty are recognized as the services are provided 
when a sale involves multiple elements  revenue is allocated to each respective element in accordance with guidance codified in accounting standards codification asc topic accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we determined the estimated selling price for each of the elements in our multiple element sales based on the selling price hierarchy and allocated consideration to the deliverables using the relative selling price method 
prior to january   we recognized revenue based on multiple element revenue guidance which required the existence of vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe for the undelivered elements in an arrangement in order for us to account for the elements separately 
we utilized the residual method of allocation to account for delivered elements 
costs related to products delivered are recognized in the period revenue is recognized 
cost of goods sold consists primarily of direct labor  allocated manufacturing overhead  raw materials and components and excludes amortization of intangible assets 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
in making the determination of the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts  we consider specific accounts  historical write offs  changes in customer relationships and credit worthiness and concentrations of credit risk 
specific accounts receivable are written off once a determination is made that the account is uncollectible 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is  as of december  and  as of december  
table of contents allowance for warranty expenses 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of component suppliers  warranty obligations are affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
the allowance for warranties was  at december  and  at december  reserve for inventory obsolescence 
we write down inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected  or if in the future we decide to discontinue sales and marketing of any of our products  additional inventory write downs may be required 
at december   we had a reserve for obsolete and excess inventory of  at december  and  at december  valuation of intangible and long lived assets 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangible assets  long lived assets and related goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in addition  goodwill is tested for impairment annually 
factors we consider important  which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results 
significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business 
significant negative industry or economic trends 
significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
for intangible assets and long lived assets  if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows from such asset 
for goodwill  if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any potential impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate that we believe is commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
annually  we also test for impairment of goodwill for each of our reporting units by estimating their fair value  utilizing a discounted cash flow methodology to determine a reasonable valuation 
the evaluation of asset impairment requires us to make assumptions about future cash flows over the life of the asset being evaluated 
these assumptions require significant judgment and actual results may differ from assumed or estimated amounts 
our remaining goodwill at december  and in the amount of  relates to our semiconductor reporting unit 
our recent analyses performed in the fourth quarters of and indicate that this goodwill is not impaired 
however  our conclusion could change in the future  if our assumptions about future economic conditions  revenue growth or profitability change 
any resulting impairment charge could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations in the future 
income taxes 
significant judgment is required in determining worldwide income tax expense based upon tax laws in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
we have established reserves for uncertain tax positions by applying the more likely than not criteria codified in asc topic accounting for income taxes  under which the recognition threshold is met when an entity concludes that a tax position  based solely on its technical merits  is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant tax authority 
all tax positions are analyzed periodically and adjustments are made as events occur that warrant modification  such as the completion of audits or the expiration of statutes of limitations  which may result in future charges or credits to income tax expense 
as part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements  management is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating the current tax liability  as well as assessing temporary differences arising from the different treatment of items for financial statement and tax purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are recorded on our balance sheet 

table of contents we currently have significant deferred tax assets as a result of temporary differences between taxable income on our tax returns and us gaap income  research and development tax credit carry forwards and foreign net operating loss carry forwards 
a deferred tax asset generally represents future tax benefits to be received when temporary differences previously reported in our financial statements become deductible for income tax purposes  or when net operating loss carry forwards or credits are applied against future taxable income  or when tax credit carry forwards are utilized on our tax returns 
we assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance based on the guidance provided in current financial accounting standards 
significant judgment is required in determining the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
the assessment of whether valuation allowances are required considers  among other matters  the nature  frequency and severity of any current and cumulative losses  forecasts of future profitability  the duration of statutory carry forward periods  our experience with loss carry forwards not expiring unused and tax planning alternatives 
in analyzing the need for valuation allowances  we first considered our history of cumulative losses for us income tax purposes over the past three years and also gave significant consideration to our results for us income tax purposes over the past five years  as the economic cycles in our industry have tended to average five years in length from peak to trough 
we also considered our forecasts of future profitability  the duration of statutory carry forward periods and tax planning alternatives 
finally  we considered the length and severity of the recent global economic crisis  the impact that it had on our operating results and our expectation for rebound given recent signs of recovery in the global economy and more specifically in our markets 
after considering all of these factors  and after considering other significant positive evidence  we concluded that a valuation allowance with respect to substantially all of our us based deferred tax assets was not required at december  our results in both and were negatively impacted by the recent global economic slowdown  and we incurred a loss in the united states in both and  where most of our net deferred tax assets are recorded
