item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
our consolidated financial statements are not directly comparable from period to period because of our acquisition and disposition of selected assets of radio stations and our acquisitions of non broadcast businesses 
see note to our consolidated financial statements under item for additional information 
overview as a radio broadcasting company with a national radio network  we derive our broadcast revenue primarily from the sale of broadcast time and radio advertising on a national and local basis 
historically  our principal sources of broadcast revenue have been the sale of block program time  both to national and local program producers  the sale of advertising time on our radio stations  both to national and local advertisers  and the sale of advertising time on our national radio network 
the rates we are able to charge for broadcast time and advertising time are dependent upon several factors  including audience share  how well our stations perform for our clients  the size of the market  the general economic conditions in each market  and supply and demand on both a local and national level 
our principal sources of non broadcast revenue include the sale of internet advertising  the support and promotion to stream third party content on our websites  sales of software and support services fees from authors for book publishing  subscription fees for our magazines  the sale of print magazine advertising  and product sales and royalties for on air host materials the following table shows the dollar amount and percentage of net broadcast revenue for each broadcast revenue source 
year ended december  dollars in thousands block program time national local advertising national local infomercials network other net broadcast revenue our broadcast revenues are impacted by the program rates our radio stations charge  the level of broadcast airtime sold and by the advertising rates our radio stations and networks charge 
the rates for block programming time are based upon our stations ability to attract audiences that will support the program producers through contributions and purchases of their products 
advertising rates are based upon the demand for advertising time  which in turn is based on our stations and networks ability to produce results for their advertisers 
we do not subscribe to traditional audience measuring services for most of our radio stations 
instead  we have marketed ourselves to advertisers based upon the responsiveness of our audiences 
in selected markets  we do subscribe to arbitron  which develops quarterly reports to measure a radio station s audience share in the demographic groups targeted by advertisers 
each of our radio stations and our networks has a pre determined level of time that they make available for block programming and or advertising  which may vary at different times of the day 
arbitron has developed technology to collect data for its ratings service 
the ppm is a small pager size device that does not require active manipulation by the end user and is capable of automatically measuring radio  television  internet  satellite radio and satellite television signals that are encoded for the service by the broadcaster 
the ppm offers a number of advantages over the traditional diary ratings collection system including ease of use  more reliable ratings data and shorter time periods between when advertising runs and when audience listening or viewing habits can be reported 
this service is already in a number of our markets and is scheduled to be introduced in more markets in the future 
it is not clear what long term impact  if any  the introduction of the ppm will have on our revenues for stations that subscribe to arbitron 
as is typical in the radio broadcasting industry  our second and fourth quarter advertising revenue generally exceeds our first and third quarter advertising revenue 
this seasonal fluctuation in advertising revenue corresponds with quarterly fluctuations in the retail advertising industry 
quarterly revenue from the sale of block programming time does not tend to vary significantly  however  because program rates are generally set annually and are recognized on a per program basis 
we currently program of our stations with our christian teaching and talk format  which is talk programming with christian and family themes 
we also program news talk stations  contemporary christian music stations  business format stations  and five spanish language christian teaching and talk stations 
during and  we increased the number of stations that we operate in our business format from two to eleven 
the business format features financial experts  business talk  and nationally recognized bloomberg programming 
the business format operates similar to our christian teaching talk format as it features long form block programming 
our cash flow has historically been affected by a transitional period experienced by radio stations when  due to the nature of the radio station  our plans for the market and other circumstances  we find it beneficial to change its format 
this transitional period is when we develop a radio station s listener and customer base 
during this period  a station may generate negative or insignificant cash flow 
in the broadcasting industry  radio stations often utilize trade or barter agreements to exchange advertising time for goods or services in lieu of cash 
in order to preserve the sale of our advertising time for cash  we generally enter into trade agreements only if the goods or services bartered to us will be used in our business 
we have minimized our use of trade agreements and have generally sold most of our advertising time for cash 
in  we sold of our broadcast revenue for cash 
in addition  it is our general policy not to preempt advertising paid for in cash with advertising paid for in trade 
the primary operating expenses incurred in the ownership and operation of our radio stations include i employee salaries  commissions and related employee benefits and taxes  ii facility expenses such as rent and utilities  iii marketing and promotional expenses and iv music license fees 
in addition to these expenses  our network incurs programming costs and lease expenses for satellite communication facilities 
we also incur and expect to continue to incur significant depreciation  amortization and interest expense as a result of completed and future acquisitions and existing and future borrowings 
salem web network and townhall 
com  our internet businesses  earn revenues from the sales of streaming services  sales of advertising and  to a lesser extent  sales of software and software support contracts 
salem publishing  our publishing business  earns its revenue by selling advertising in and subscriptions to its publications and by selling books 
xulon press generally earns its revenue from the publishing of books 
the revenues of these businesses are reported as non broadcast on our consolidated statement of operations 
the primary operating expense incurred in the operation of our non broadcast entities include i employee salaries  commissions and related employee benefits and taxes  ii facility expenses such as rent and utilities  iii marketing and promotional expenses and iv printing and production costs 
the expenses directly associated with these businesses are reported as non broadcast on our consolidated statement of operations 
known trends and uncertainties beginning in july  our advertising revenue was negatively impacted by declining advertising from our customers  particularly in the financial services and auto industries 
we believe this decline was primarily the result of the struggling united states economy and corresponding reductions in discretionary advertising spending by our customers 
declines in advertising revenue have affected both our broadcasting segment and non broadcasting segment 
in response to these economic challenges  we initiated several cost reduction strategies including reducing headcount by approximately  temporarily suspending the company match on k contributions as of july  temporarily suspending the management bonus program  limiting capital expenditures  reducing the base salary for all employees by as of february  with certain members of executive management reduced by  requiring all employees to use accrued vacation balances by march   offering incentives to employees to use accrued vacation balances as of december   and consolidating programming on most of our contemporary christian music stations 
during  advertising revenue showed signs of improvement in both our broadcast and non broadcast segments 
if a double dip recession were to occur  or if the economic climate does not continue to improve  our exposure to several risks increases  including but not limited to increasing pressure to sell advertising and block programming time at discounted rates  increases in the length of time to collect receivables and higher risks that the accounts become uncollectible as our customers face tight credit markets  ministries are experiencing lower levels of donations that could negatively impact their ability to purchase and pay for block programming time  we may not be able to find suitable replacements for ministries that can no longer purchase and pay for block programming  limitations on our ability to obtain additional financing to fund working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other corporate requirements  limitations on our ability to purse projects that could have been beneficial  and impairment losses on the value of our indefinite lived intangible assets including fcc broadcast licenses  goodwill  and mastheads and impairment losses on other long lived assets 
same station definition in the discussion of our results of operations below  we compare our results between periods on an as reported basis that is  the results of operations of all radio stations and network formats owned or operated at any time during either period and on a same station basis

non gaap financial measures the performance of a radio broadcasting company is customarily measured by the ability of its stations to generate station operating income 
we define station operating income soi as net broadcast revenue less broadcast operating expenses 
accordingly  changes in net broadcast revenue and broadcast operating expenses  as explained above  have a direct impact on changes in soi 
soi is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with gaap 
soi should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for our results of operations presented on the basis of gaap 
management believes that soi is a useful non gaap financial measure to investors  when considered in conjunction with operating income  the most directly comparable gaap financial measure  because it is generally recognized by the radio broadcasting industry as a tool in measuring performance and in applying valuation methodologies for companies in the media  entertainment and communications industries 
this measure is used by investors and analysts who report on the industry to provide comparisons between broadcasting groups 
additionally  our management uses soi as one of the key measures of operating efficiency  profitability and our internal review associated with our impairment analysis of indefinite lived intangible assets 
soi does not purport to represent cash provided by operating activities 
our statement of cash flows presents our cash flow activity and our income statement presents our historical performance prepared in accordance with gaap 
soi as defined by and used by our company is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies

the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to acquisitions and upgrades of radio station and network assets  revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  goodwill and other non intangible assets  uncertain tax positions  valuation allowance deferred taxes  long term debt and debt covenant compliance  and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies and the related judgments and estimates are critical accounting policies that affect the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
accounting for acquisitions and upgrades of radio station and network assets a majority of our radio station acquisitions have consisted primarily of the fcc licenses to broadcast in a particular market 
we often do not acquire the existing format  or we change the format upon acquisition when we find it beneficial 
as a result  a substantial portion of the purchase price for the assets of a radio station is allocated to the broadcast license 
it is our policy generally to retain third party appraisers to value radio stations  networks or non broadcast properties 
the allocations assigned to acquired broadcast licenses and other assets are subjective by their nature and require our careful consideration and judgment 
we believe the allocations represent appropriate estimates of the fair value of the assets acquired 
as part of the valuation and appraisal process  the third party appraisers prepare reports that assign values to the various asset categories in our financial statements 
our management reviews these reports and determines the reasonableness of the assigned values used to record the acquisition of the radio station  network or non broadcast properties at the close of the transaction 
we undertake projects from time to time to upgrade our radio station technical facilities and or fcc broadcast licenses 
our policy is to capitalize costs incurred up to the point where the project is complete  at which time we transfer the costs to the appropriate fixed asset and or intangible asset categories 
when the completion of a project is contingent upon fcc or other regulatory approval  we assess the probable future benefit of the asset at the time that it is recorded and monitor it through the fcc or other regulatory approval process 
in the event the required approval is not considered probable or the project is abandoned  we write off the capitalized costs of the project 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized when pervasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or the service has been rendered  the price to the customer is fixed or determinable and collection of the arrangement fee is reasonably assured 
revenues from radio programs and commercial advertising are recognized when the program or advertisement is broadcast 
revenue is reported net of agency commissions  which are calculated based on a stated percentage applied to gross billing 
our customers principally include not for profit charitable organizations and commercial advertisers 
revenue from the sale of products and services from our non broadcast businesses are recognized when the products are shipped and the services are rendered 
revenues from the sale of advertising in our magazines are recognized upon publication 
revenue from the sale of subscriptions to our publications are recognized over the life of the subscription 
revenue from book sales are recorded when shipment occurs 
advertising by the radio stations exchanged for goods and services is recorded as the advertising is broadcast and is valued at the estimated value of goods or services received or to be received 
the value of the goods and services received in such barter transactions is charged to expense when used 
barter advertising revenue included in broadcast revenue for the years ended december   and was approximately million  million and million  respectively  and barter expenses were approximately the same as barter revenue for each period 
we record broadcast advertising provided in exchange for goods and services as broadcast revenue and the goods or services received in exchange for such advertising as broadcast operating expenses 
multiple deliverables we may enter bundled advertising agreements that include spot advertisements on our radio stations  internet banner placements  print magazine advertisements and booth space at specific events or some combination thereof 
the multiple deliverables contained in each agreement are accounted for separately over their respective delivery period provided that they are separate units of accounting 
the selling price used for each deliverable is based on vendor specific objective evidence if available or estimated selling price if vendor specific objective evidence is not available 
objective evidence of fair value includes the price charged for each element when it is sold separately 
the estimated selling price is the price that we would transact if the deliverable were sold regularly on a standalone basis 
arrangement consideration is allocated at the inception of each arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method 
the relative selling price method allocates any discount in the arrangement proportionally to each deliverable on the basis of each deliverable s selling price 
the adoption of asu no  did not change the units of accounting  how we allocate consideration to various units of accounting  or the timing of revenue recognition 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
an analysis is performed by applying various percentages based on the age of the receivable and other subjective and historical analysis 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the likelihood of ultimate realization of these receivables including the current creditworthiness of each customer 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
accounting for discontinued operations we regularly review underperforming stations  particularly those in non strategic formats  to determine if a sale might be a better way to monetize the station assets 
when a station or group of stations is considered for sale  we review the transaction to determine if or when the entity qualifies as a discontinued operation in accordance with the criteria of fasb asc topic discontinued operations 
this pronouncement specifies that the operations and cash flow of the entity disposed of to be sold have or will be eliminated from the ongoing operations as a result of the disposal and that we will not have significant continuing involvement in the operations after the disposal transaction 
we define a cluster as a group of radio stations operating in the same geographic market  sharing the same building and equipment and being managed by a single general manager 
general managers are compensated based on the results of their cluster as a whole  not the results of any individual radio stations 
therefore  we have determined that an entity qualifies for a discontinued operation when management  having the authority to approve the action  commits to a plan to sell the asset disposal group  the sale is probable  and the sale will result in the exit of a particular geographic market 
we entered a plan to sell all radio stations in the milwaukee market during we sold radio station wrrd am in milwaukee  wisconsin for million on march  and sold radio station wfzh fm in milwaukee  wisconsin for million on may  we entered into an lma with the buyer of wfzh fm effective as of february   under which the buyer began programming the station and paying a majority of operational costs of the station 
the accompanying consolidated statements of operations reflect the operating results of the milwaukee stations as a discontinued operation for the year ended december  we ceased publishing the ccm magazine as of march the operating results for ccm magazine were reported as a discontinued operation as of this date 
the accompanying consolidated statements of operations reflect the operating results of this entity as a discontinued operation for the year ended december  on july   we entered into an asset purchase agreement to sell radio station wrfd am in columbus  ohio for million 
as a result of the sale  we were to exit the columbus  ohio market 
the consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations for all periods presented were reclassified as of the date of the asset purchase agreement to reflect the operating results and net assets of this market as a discontinued operation through december the sale was expected to close in the fourth quarter of on december   the buyer of the radio station advised us that they would not be able to meet the terms of the asset purchase agreement 
because of the buyer terminating the agreement  we have reclassified the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented to reflect the operating results and net assets of this market in continuing operations 
in january  we collected a million termination fee from the buyer pursuant to the asset purchase agreement 
the following table sets forth the components of income loss from discontinued operations as reclassified  net of tax  for the years ended december  and year ended december  dollars in thousands net revenues operating expenses operating loss gain loss on sale of radio station assets income loss from discontinued operations provision for benefit from income taxes income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets approximately of our total assets as of december   consist of indefinite lived intangible assets  such as broadcast licenses  goodwill and mastheads  the value of which depends significantly upon the operating results of our businesses 
in the case of our radio stations  we would not be able to operate the properties without the related fcc license for each property 
broadcast licenses are renewed with the fcc every eight years for a nominal cost that is expensed as incurred 
we continually monitor our stations compliance with the various regulatory requirements 
historically  all of our broadcast licenses have been renewed at the end of their respective periods  and we expect that all broadcast licenses will continue to be renewed in the future 
accordingly  we consider our broadcast licenses to be indefinite lived intangible assets in accordance with financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification fasb asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other 
we do not amortize goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible assets  but rather test for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired 
the unit of accounting used to test broadcast licenses is the cluster level  which we defines as a group of radio stations operating in the same geographic market  sharing the same building and equipment and managed by a single general manager 
the cluster level is the lowest level for which discrete financial information is available and the level reviewed by management to analyze operating results 
goodwill and mastheads  primarily attributable to our non broadcast operating segment  are tested at the business unit level  which we define by publication or website 
broadcast licenses account for approximately of our indefinite lived intangible assets 
goodwill and magazine mastheads account for the remaining 
we complete our annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each year 
based on deteriorating macro economic factors  including declining radio industry revenues throughout and a weakening in prevailing radio station transaction multiples  we tested our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment in the second  third and fourth quarters of during  we did not have indications of impairment at interim dates 
we performed annually testing for this period that did not result in impairment charges 
the valuation of intangible assets is subjective and based on estimates rather than precise calculations 
if actual future results are not consistent with the assumptions and estimates used  we may be exposed to impairment charges in the future  the amount of which may be material 
the fair value measurements for our indefinite lived intangible assets use significant unobservable inputs that reflect our own assumptions about the estimates that market participants would use in measuring fair value including assumptions about risk 
the unobservable inputs are defined in fasb asc topic fair value measurements and disclosures as level inputs discussed in detail in note to our consolidated financial statements 
when performing our impairment testing for broadcast licenses we review the financial performance of the market clusters against established internal benchmarks 
for testing periods as of december  and prior  the first step of our impairment testing process compared the fair value as determined from valuations obtained in prior periods from an independent third party to the carrying value to determine the degree by which the amounts differed 
we had discounted the prior period appraised fair values by to  adjusting our discount percentages higher each period beginning with our interim testing based on reduced revenues and overall market conditions  including declines in market values associated with radio station sales 
if the discounted prior period fair value exceeded the carrying value of the broadcast licenses  the assets were deemed not to be impaired 
for our impairment reviews completed during and  we did not discount the prior period appraised fair value of any broadcast market cluster as in most markets the carrying value has been reduced to equal the fair value 
due to the number of recent appraisals  we compared actual operating revenues as of the period end to the projected revenues used in the most recent appraisals 
markets with actual operating results that exceeded the projections  which were not subject to changes in other assumptions such as the weighted average cost of capital  were deemed not to be impaired 
the second step of our impairment testing process compares the carrying value of the broadcast licenses for each market cluster including goodwill to the station operating income soi for each market cluster including goodwill as of the period end 
if the carrying value of the broadcast licenses was less than six times the annualized soi  the broadcast licenses were deemed not to be impaired 
as radio stations are typically sold on the basis of a multiple of projected operating income usually up to a multiple of eight  we believe that a benchmark of six appears conservative even in today s market 
we evaluate the soi multiples used in our testing based on market data available as of each testing date 
for market clusters that do not meet the first or second test benchmarks  bond pecaro  an independent third party appraisal and valuation firm  is engaged to perform an appraisal of the indefinite lived intangible asset s 
bond pecaro utilizes an income approach to value broadcast licenses 
the income approach measures the expected economic benefits that the broadcast licenses provides and discounts these future benefits using a discounted cash flow analysis 
the discounted cash flow analysis assumes that the broadcast licenses are held by hypothetical start up stations and the values yielded by the discounted cash flow analysis represent the portion of the stations value attributable solely to the broadcast license 
the discounted cash flow model incorporates variables such as projected revenues  operating profit margins  and a discount rate 
the variables used reflect historical company growth trends  industry projections  and the anticipated performance of the business 
the discounted cash flow projection period was determined to be ten years  which is typically the time radio station operators and investors expect to recover their investments as widely used by industry analysts in their forecasts 
the key assumptions used in the bond pecaro analysis to estimate the fair value of each major category of assets in our broadcast segment for each testing period were as follows as of the interim testing period ended june  broadcast licenses goodwill discount rate market growth rates next months out year market growth range market share range operating profit margin range as of the interim testing period ended september  broadcast licenses goodwill discount rate market growth rates next months out year market growth range market share range operating profit margin range as of the annual testing period ended december  broadcast licenses goodwill discount rate market growth rates out year market growth range market share range operating profit margin range as of the annual testing period ended december  broadcast licenses goodwill discount rate market growth rates out year market growth range market share range operating profit margin range we also test goodwill balances within the broadcast segment for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests when there are indications of impairment 
the first step of our goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the most recent appraised fair value of the market cluster for markets with actual operating results that exceeded the estimates used in the appraisal model to the carrying value of the market cluster  including goodwill 
if the appraised fair value exceeded the carrying value  goodwill is deemed not to be impaired 
for market clusters that were not appraised  we determined the implied fair value of the market cluster as a multiple of soi as noted in our second test of the fcc license value 
if the implied fair value exceeded the carrying value of the market cluster  goodwill is deemed not to be impaired 
market clusters that do not meet these two tests are subject to appraisal 
the second test of the goodwill impairment test  used to measure the impairment loss  compares either the appraised value or the implied fair value of the market cluster including goodwill to the carrying value of the market cluster including goodwill 
if the carrying value exceeded these amounts  a loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess

as of the annual testing period ended december  market cluster impairment based on internal benchmarks percentage by which fair value exceeds carrying value boston  ma yes chicago  il yes detroit  mi yes phoenix  az yes sacramento  ca yes san francisco  ca yes there was no goodwill impairment for the testing period ended december  as a result of our review and valuation for the testing period ended december   we recognized a pre tax impairment charge of million associated with the value of broadcast licenses in the detroit market 
in addition  we recognized pre tax impairment charges during our september   interim review and valuation of million associated with the value of broadcast licenses in the cleveland  atlanta  detroit and portland markets  and pre tax impairment charges recognized during our june  interim review and valuation of million associated with the value of broadcast licenses in the dallas and portland markets and million associated with the value of goodwill in the dallas market 
for the annual review and valuation for the period ended december   we recognized impairment charges of million associated with the value of broadcast licenses and goodwill in the boston  detroit  cleveland  louisville  tampa  miami  orlando  sacramento  omaha  and nashville market clusters 
the broadcast impairments recognized during were driven in part by declining revenues at the industry and market levels  declining radio stations transaction multiples and a higher cost of capital 
the impairments were indicative of a trend in the broadcast industry and were not unique to the company 
when performing impairment testing for our non broadcast indefinite lived intangible assets  we review the financial performance of the reporting unit against established internal benchmarks 
for testing periods as of december  and prior  the first step of our impairment testing compared the fair value as determined from an independent third party to the carrying value to determine the degree by which the amounts differed 
we had discounted the prior period appraised fair values by to  adjusting our discount percentages higher each period beginning with our testing based on reduced revenues and overall market conditions 
if the discounted fair value exceeded the carrying value of the indefinite lived intangible assets  the assets were deemed not to be impaired 
for our impairment reviews completed during and  we did not discount the prior period appraised fair value of any reporting unit as the carrying value of the unit had already been reduced to equal the fair value 
due to the number of recent appraisals  we compared actual operating revenues as of the period end to the projected revenues used in the most recent appraisals 
reporting units with actual operating results that exceeded the projections  which were not subject to changes in other assumptions such as the weighted average cost of capital  were deemed not to be impaired 
the second step of our impairment testing process compared the carrying value of the indefinite lived intangible assets  specifically mastheads and goodwill  for each reporting unit as of the testing date to the enterprise value 
enterprise value is defined as six times the net operating income for each reporting unit as of the trailing months plus the net book value of the property  plant and equipment of the operating unit 
for the annual testing periods ended december  and  we used the actual net operating income for each reporting unit for the last twelve months 
as media entities are typically sold on the basis of a multiple of projected operating income  usually in excess of eight  we believe that a benchmark of six appears conservative even in today s market 
we evaluate the multiples used in our testing based on market data available as of each testing date 
if the carrying value of the intangibles is less than the enterprise value  the intangible assets are deemed not to be impaired 
for reporting units that do not meet the internal benchmarks  bond pecaro  an independent third party appraisal and valuation firm  is engaged to perform an appraisal of the indefinite lived asset s 
bond pecaro utilizes an income approach to estimate the fair value of the businesses 
the income approach measures the expected economic benefits these assets bring to the holder 
the fair value of the business may be expressed by discounting these future benefits 
the discounted cash flow model incorporated variables such as projected revenues  operating cash flow margins  and a discount rate 
the variables used reflect historical company growth trends  industry projections  and the anticipated performance of the business 
the discounted cash flow projection period was determined to be ten years  which is typically the time media and technology property investors expect to recover their investments as widely used by industry analysts in their forecasts 
the key assumptions used in the bond pecaro analysis to estimate the fair value of each major category of assets in our non broadcast segment for each testing period was as follows as of the interim testing period ended june  other indefinite lived intangible assets goodwill discount rate operating cash flow growth rate long term growth rate as of the interim testing period ended september  other indefinite lived intangible assets goodwill discount rate operating cash flow growth rate long term growth rate as of the annual testing period ended december  other indefinite lived intangible assets goodwill discount rate operating cash flow growth rate long term growth rate as of the annual testing period ended december  other indefinite lived intangible assets goodwill discount rate operating cash flow growth rate long term growth rate we also test goodwill balances within the non broadcast segment for impairment on an annual basis and between annual dates when there are indications of impairment 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment  by comparing the most recent appraised fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill 
if the appraised fair value exceeds the carrying value  goodwill is deemed not to be impaired 
for reporting units that were not appraised  we use the implied fair value of the reporting unit  or enterprise value  as noted in our second test of the internal review 
if the implied fair value exceeds the carrying value  goodwill is deemed not to be impaired 
if these criteria are not met  a second test is applied 
the second test of the goodwill impairment test  used to measure the amount of any impairment loss  compares either the appraised fair value or the implied fair value of the reporting unit including goodwill to the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill 
if the carrying value exceeds these amounts  a loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess 
there were no impairments recognized for the annual testing period ended december  for the interim testing period ended june   we recognized an impairment charge of million associated with the value of goodwill and mastheads in our non broadcast segment 
for the interim testing period ended september  and the annual testing period ended december   there were no impairments recognized 
the results of our impairment testing process for our non broadcast segment for each testing period were as follows as of the interim testing period ended june  reporting unit impairment based on internal benchmarks percentage by which fair value exceeds carrying value salem publishing yes as of the interim testing period ended september  reporting unit impairment based on internal benchmarks percentage by which fair value exceeds carrying value oneplace yes townhall 
com yes as of the annual testing period ended december  reporting unit impairment based on internal benchmarks percentage by which fair value exceeds carrying value salem publishing yes as of the annual testing period ended december  reporting unit impairment based on internal benchmarks percentage by which fair value exceeds carrying value salem publishing yes the economic downturn that began during negatively affected our ability to generate revenues 
the discount rate assumptions used in our impairment tests are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the respective market clusters and reporting units 
cash flows and operating income for each of our reporting units is contingent upon the ability of the entity to generate revenues 
our radio stations are to varying degrees dependent upon advertising for their revenues 
our non broadcast operating entities are also dependent upon advertising revenue 
included in our broadcast valuation estimates are a to a increase in revenues for as compared to followed by up to a increase in as compared to included in our non broadcast valuation estimates are projected profit margins of up to projected for  increasing to in failure to achieve the anticipated growth rates and or declines in excess of those amounts may result in future impairment losses  the amount of which may be material 
income taxes and uncertain tax positions we account for income taxes in accordance with fasb asc topic income taxes 
upon the adoption of the provisions on january   we had million in liabilities related to uncertain tax positions  including million recognized under fasb asc topic contingencies and carried forward from prior years and million recognized upon adoption of the tax provision changes as a reduction to retained earnings 
included in the million accrual was million related interest  net of federal income tax benefits 
during  we recognized a net increase of million in liabilities and at december   had million in liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits 
included in this liability amount were million accrued for the related interest  net of federal income tax benefits  and million for the related penalty recorded in income tax expense on our consolidated statements of operations 
during  we recognized a net decrease of million in liabilities and at december   had million in liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits 
included in this liability amount were million accrued for the related interest  net of federal income tax benefits  and million for the related penalty recorded in income tax expense on our consolidated statements of operations 
a summary of the changes in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits for the year ended december   is as follows dollars in thousands balance at january  additions based on tax positions related to the current year additions based on tax positions related to prior years reductions related to tax positions of prior years decrease due to statute expirations related interest and penalties  net of federal tax benefits balance as of december  valuation allowance deferred taxes for financial reporting purposes  we recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december  to offset a portion of the deferred tax assets related to the state net operating loss carryforwards 
management regularly reviews our financial forecasts in an effort to determine our ability to utilize the net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes 
accordingly  the valuation allowance is adjusted periodically based on management s estimate of the benefit the company will receive from such carryforwards 
fair value accounting fasb asc topic fair value measurements and disclosures established a single definition of fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expanded disclosure requirements about fair value measurements 
the provision applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
we adopted the fair value provisions for financial assets and financial liabilities effective january  the adoption had a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we adopted fair value provisions for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities effective january  this includes applying the fair value concept to i nonfinancial assets and liabilities initially measured at fair value in business combinations  ii reporting units or nonfinancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in conjunction with goodwill impairment testing  iii other nonfinancial assets measured at fair value in conjunction with impairment assessments  and iv asset retirement obligations initially measured at fair value 
the adoption of the fair value provisions of fasb asc topic to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the fair value provisions include guidance on how to estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities in the current economic environment and reemphasizes that the objective of a fair value measurement remains an exit price 
if we were to conclude that there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity of the asset or liability in relation to normal market activities  quoted market values may not be representative of fair value and we may conclude that a change in valuation technique or the use of multiple valuation techniques may be appropriate 
the degree of judgment utilized in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally correlates to the level of pricing observability 
pricing observability is affected by a number of factors  including the type of financial instrument  whether the financial instrument is new to the market  and the characteristics specific to the transaction 
financial instruments with readily available active quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices generally will have a higher degree of pricing observability and a lesser degree of judgment utilized in measuring fair value 
conversely  financial instruments rarely traded or not quoted will generally have less or no pricing observability and a higher degree of judgment utilized in measuring fair value 
fasb asc topic established a hierarchal disclosure framework associated with the level of pricing observability utilized in measuring fair value 
this framework defined three levels of inputs to the fair value measurement process and requires that each fair value measurement be assigned to a level corresponding to the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
the three broad levels of inputs defined by the fasb asc topic hierarchy are as follows level inputs quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date  level inputs inputs other than quoted prices included within level that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly 
if the asset or liability has a specified contractual term  a level input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability  and level inputs unobservable inputs for the asset or liability 
these unobservable inputs reflect the entity s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability  and are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances which might include the reporting entity s own data 
as a result of the adoption of the fair value provisions  we modified the assumptions used in measuring the fair value of our derivative positions 
specifically  we now include the impact of our own credit risk on derivative liabilities measured at fair value as defined 
counterparty credit risk adjustments are applied to derivatives  such as over the counter derivatives  where the base valuation uses market parameters based on libor interest rate curves 
not all counterparties have the same credit risk as that implied by the relevant libor curve  so it is necessary to consider the market value of the credit risk of the counterparty in order to estimate the fair value of such an item 
bilateral or own credit risk adjustments are applied to our own credit risk when valuing derivatives measured at fair value 
credit adjustments consider the estimated future cash flows between the company and its counterparties under the terms of the instruments and affect the credit risk on the valuation of those cash flows  rather than a point in time assessment of the current recognized net asset or liability 
the fair value of our liabilities is impacted by our credit ratings as established by agencies such as moody s investor services moody s and standard poor s s p 
the estimated change in the fair value of these liabilities  including the credit risk and all other market variables  was a gain of million for the period ended december  we settled our outstanding swap transactions on december  when we terminated our then existing bank credit facilities  resulting in a loss of million 
the loss represents the difference in the discounted value as estimated in accordance with fasb asc topic and the actual amount the bank was willing to accept in an arms length transaction 
as of december   each major category of assets measured at fair value on a non recurring basis are categorized as follows total level level level as of december  dollars in thousands non recurring assets subject to fair value measurement broadcast licenses goodwill other indefinite lived intangible assets total long term debt and debt covenant compliance our classification of borrowings under our revolver as long term debt on our balance sheet is based on our assessment that  under the terms of our credit agreement and after considering our projected operating results and cash flows for the coming year  no principal payments are required to be made 
these projections are estimates dependent upon a number of factors including developments in the markets in which we are operating in and economic and political factors  among other factors 
accordingly  these projections are inherently uncertain and our actual results could differ from these estimates 
stock based compensation we have one stock option plan  the amended and restated stock incentive plan  the plan under which stock options and restricted stock awards are granted to employees  directors  officers and advisors of the company 
a maximum of  shares are authorized under the plan  of which  are outstanding and  are exercisable as of december  we account for stock based compensation under the provisions of fasb asc topic compensation stock compensation 
we record equity awards under the fair value method with share based compensation measured at the fair value of the award as of the grant date 
the exercise price for options is equal to the closing market price of salem communications common stock on the date of grant 
we use the straight line attribution method to recognize share based compensation costs over the service period of the award 
upon exercise  cancellation  forfeiture  or expiration of stock options  or upon vesting or forfeiture of restricted stock awards  deferred tax assets for options and restricted stock awards with multiple vesting dates are eliminated for each vesting period on a first in  first out basis as if each vesting period was a separate award 
recent accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 amendments to certain recognition and disclosure requirements asu no 
 which is included in the fasb accounting standards codification the asc topic subsequent events 
asu no 
clarifies that an sec filer is required to evaluate subsequent events through the date that the financial statements are issued 
asu no 
is effective upon the issuance of the final update and had no impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued asu no 
 improvements to financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities asu no 
 which replaced the quantitative based risks and rewards calculation for determining which reporting entity  if any  has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity vie with a primarily qualitative analysis 
the qualitative analysis is based on identifying the party that has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the vie s economic performance the power criterion and the obligation to absorb losses from or the right to receive benefits of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie the losses benefit criterion 
the party that meets both these criteria is deemed to have a controlling financial interest 
the party with the controlling financial interest is considered to be the primary beneficiary and as a result is required to consolidate the vie 
asu no 
had no impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in january  the fasb issued asu no 
 improving disclosures about fair value measurements asu no 
 which provides amendments to the fasb asc subtopic that require new disclosures regarding i transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements and ii activity in level fair value measurements 
asu no 
also clarifies existing disclosures regarding i the level of asset and liability disaggregation and ii fair value measurement inputs and valuation techniques 
the new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosures are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements in the roll forward of activity in level fair value measurements 
those disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
we are currently evaluating the disclosure impact of adoption on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued asu no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements asu no 

asu no 
provides guidance for arrangements with multiple deliverables 
specifically  the updated accounting standard requires an entity to allocate arrangement consideration at the inception of an arrangement to all of its deliverables based on their relative selling prices 
asu no 
also eliminates the residual method of allocation and requires use of the relative selling price method in all circumstances in which an entity recognizes revenue for an arrangement with multiple deliverables 
asu no 
is effective as of january with early adoption permitted 
the adoption of asu no 
did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed acquisitions through borrowings  including borrowings under credit facilities and  to a lesser extent  from operating cash flow and selected asset dispositions 
we currently expect to fund any future acquisitions from cash on hand  proceeds from debt and equity offerings  borrowings under our credit facility  operating cash flow and possibly through the sale of income producing assets 
we have historically funded  and will continue to fund  expenditures for operations  administrative expenses  capital expenditures and debt service required by our credit facilities and the notes from operating cash flow  borrowings under the revolver and  if necessary  proceeds from the sale of selected assets or radio stations 
cash flows cash and cash equivalents decreased million to million as of december  compared to million as of the same period of the prior year 
working capital decreased million to million as of december   compared to million for the same period of the prior year 
the following events impacted our liquidity and capital resources during the year ended december  our net income from continuing operations increased million to million from a loss of million for the prior year  consolidated net receivables increased million to million from million as of the prior year  capital expenditures increased million to million from million for the prior year  cash paid for acquisitions increased million to million from million for the prior year  a special cash distribution of per share on our outstanding class a common stock was paid on december  in the amount of million  we redeemed million of total principal on the notes at a price equal to of face value  or million in cash  and we increased the outstanding balance on our revolver by million  to million as of december  compared to million as of the same period of the prior year 
credit facilities the revolver and the notes have been entered into by salem communications corporation 
our parent company  salem communications corporation has no independent assets or operations 
all of the subsidiaries of salem communications corporation are currently guarantors of the revolver and the notes 
the guarantees are full and unconditional and joint and several  and any subsidiaries of the parent company other than the subsidiary guarantors are minor 
senior credit facility on december   our parent company  salem communications corporation entered into the revolver 
we amended the revolver on november  to increase the capacity from million to million 
the amendment allowed us to use borrowings under the revolver  subject to the available amount as defined by the terms of the credit agreement  to redeem applicable portions of the notes

impairment losses on goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in prior years  we incurred significant impairment losses with regard to our broadcast indefinite lived intangible assets 
these losses are attributable to estimated increases in the weighted average cost of capital  a decline in the estimated terminal or exit values assigned to broadcast licenses because of industry wide declines in radio station transaction multiples  decreases in projected future cash flows  and a significant decline in projected revenues as of the impairment dates as compared to prior periods 
in prior years  we also incurred significant impairment losses with regard to our non broadcast indefinite lived intangible assets 
these losses are attributable to an increase in the weighted average cost of capital  a decline in the estimated terminal or exit values assigned to the assets because of industry wide declines in the total number of magazines sold  a decrease in projected future cash flows  and a significant decline in projected profit margins 
cash flows and operating income for each of our reporting units is contingent upon the ability of the entity to generate revenues 
our radio stations are to varying degrees dependent upon advertising for their revenues 
our non broadcast operating entities are also dependent upon advertising revenue 
the economic downturn that began during negatively impacted our ability to generate revenues 
included in the broadcast valuation estimates prepared by bond pecaro on a market participant basis for the testing period ended december   are increases in revenue of to for as compared to followed by increases of to in as compared to included in the non broadcast valuation estimates prepared by bond pecaro on a market participant basis are projected profit margins of for failure to achieve these anticipated growth rates may result in future impairment losses  the amount of which may be material 
given the current economic environment and uncertainties surrounding the potential negative impact on our business  there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions regarding the duration of the economic downturn  or the period and strength of recovery  made for the purpose of our indefinite lived intangible fair value estimates will prove to be accurate 
using market indicators from several industry analysts  our valuation estimates prepared by bond pecaro on a market participant basis anticipate revenues to show improvements of between to for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the valuation of intangible assets is subjective and based on estimates rather than precise calculations 
if actual future results are not consistent with the assumptions and estimates used  we may be exposed to impairment charges in the future  the amount of which may be material 
the fair value measurements for our indefinite lived intangible assets use significant unobservable inputs that reflect our own assumptions about the estimates that market participants would use in measuring fair value including assumptions about risk 
if actual future results are not consistent with the assumptions and estimates used  we may be exposed to impairment charges in the future  the amount of which may be material 
discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the respective market clusters and reporting units 
the impairment charges that have been recognized were non cash in nature and did not result in a violation of our then existing credit facilities or revolver 
however  the potential of future impairment charges can be viewed as a negative factor with regard to forecasted future performance and cash flows 
we believe that we have adequately considered the economic downturn in our valuation models and do not believe that the impairments in and of themselves are a liquidity risk 
off balance sheet arrangements at december  and  salem did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  salem is not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if salem had engaged in such relationships
