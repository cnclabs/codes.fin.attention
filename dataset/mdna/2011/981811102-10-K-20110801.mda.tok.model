item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  describe certain business risks 
consideration should be given to the risk factors described below as well as those in the safe harbor statement at the beginning of this annual report on form k  in conjunction with reviewing the forward looking statements and other information contained in this annual report on form k 
these risks are not the only risks we face 
our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial in our operations 
economic or industry downturns the global recession that began in adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our business and our industries  as well as the industries and businesses of many of our customers and suppliers 
the volatile domestic and global recessionary climate had significant negative impacts on our business 
the global recession  and the sluggish pace of the recovery from the global recession  resulted in a significant decrease in customer demand throughout nearly all of our markets  including our two largest markets construction and automotive 
the impacts of existing and any new government measures to aid economic recovery  including various measures intended to provide stimulus to the economy in general or to certain industries  and the growing debt levels of the united states and other countries  continue to be unknown 
overall  operating levels across many of our business segments have fallen and may remain at depressed levels until economic conditions improve and demand increases 
while certain sectors of the economy have stabilized and recovered from the economic downturn  we are unable to predict the strength  pace or sustainability of the economic recovery or the effects of government intervention or debt levels 
overall general economic conditions  both domestically and globally  have improved from the lows reached during the recession 
the automotive market has shown signs of strengthening  and the construction market has shown signs of stabilizing 
however  global economic conditions remain fragile  and the possibility remains that the domestic or global economies  or certain industry sectors of those economies that are key to our sales  may not recover as quickly as anticipated  or could further deteriorate  which could result in a corresponding decrease in demand for our products and negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition 
the construction and automotive industries account for a significant portion of our net sales  and reductions in demand from these industries have adversely impacted and may continue to adversely affect our business 
the overall downturn in the economy  the disruption in capital and credit markets  declining real estate values  high unemployment rates and reduced consumer confidence and spending caused significant reductions in demand from our end markets in general and  in particular  the construction and automotive end markets 
demand in the commercial and residential construction markets has been weak as it has been difficult for companies and consumers to obtain credit for construction projects and the economic slowdown has caused delays in or cancellations of construction projects 
non residential construction  including publicly financed state and municipal projects  has slowed significantly due to overcapacity of commercial properties and the reluctance of state and local governments to borrow money to spend on capital projects when faced with stagnant or declining tax revenues and increased operating costs 
the domestic auto industry continues to experience a difficult operating environment  which has resulted in and may continue to result in lower levels of vehicle production and an associated decrease in demand for products sold to the automotive 
table of contents industry 
many automotive manufacturers and their suppliers have reduced production levels and eliminated manufacturing capacity  through the closure of facilities  reduction in operations and other cost reduction actions 
the construction industry has shown signs of stabilizing from further erosion  and the automotive industry has strengthened and shown signs of recovery from the lows reached in recent years 
however  both the construction and automotive markets remain depressed compared to historical norms  and we cannot predict the strength  pace or sustainability of recovery in these markets 
the difficulties faced by the automotive and construction industries have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our business 
if demand for the products we sell to the automotive or construction markets were to be further reduced  this could negatively affect our sales  financial results and cash flows 
financial difficulties and bankruptcy filings by our customers could have an adverse impact on our business 
many of our customers have experienced and continue to experience challenging financial conditions 
general motors and chrysler have gone through bankruptcy proceedings and both companies implemented plans which significantly reduced their production capacity and dealership networks 
certain other customers have filed or may in the future file bankruptcy petitions 
these and other customers may be in need of additional capital or credit to continue operations 
the bankruptcies and financial difficulties of certain customers and or their failure to obtain credit or otherwise improve their overall financial condition could result in numerous changes within the markets we serve  including additional plant closings  decreased production  reduced demand  changes in product mix  unfavorable changes in the prices  terms or conditions we are able to obtain and other changes that may result in decreased purchases from us and otherwise negatively impact our business 
these conditions also increase the risk that our customers may delay or default on their payment obligations to us  particularly customers in hard hit industries such as automotive and construction 
the relative weakness in the automotive industry continues the risk that some of our customers who are suppliers to the automotive industry could have further financial difficulties 
the same is true of our customers in other industries  including construction  which are also experiencing weakness 
the automotive industry has shown signs of strengthening from the low levels of recent years  and the construction industry has shown signs of stabilizing 
however  economic conditions remain fragile  and the possibility remains that these markets may not recover as quickly as anticipated  or could further deteriorate 
should the economy or any of our markets not improve  the risk of bankruptcy filings by our customers may continue to increase 
such bankruptcy filings may result not only in a reduction in our sales  but also in a loss associated with our potential inability to collect outstanding accounts receivable from the affected customers 
while we have taken and will continue to take steps intended to mitigate the impact of financial difficulties and potential bankruptcy filings by our customers  these matters could have a negative impact on our business 
the events in japan could adversely affect our business and financial results 
a number of our customers  particularly in the automotive market  rely upon suppliers in japan for certain components of their products 
the earthquakes  tsunami and nuclear power plant problems in japan prevented some companies from receiving sufficient supplies of components  and demand in some industries  such as automotive  has been adversely affected 
other risks resulting from this tragedy include potential disruptions to other industries which include our customers or suppliers  negative macroeconomic effects on international trade and or our customers  and unforeseen challenges which could develop as the situation in japan evolves and the full scope of the damage and its effects is comprehended 
while there exists a risk that the effects of the disaster could continue to have an adverse effect on us  we are unable at this time to reliably evaluate the scope or probability of those risks 
volatility in the united states and worldwide capital and credit markets has significantly impacted and may continue to significantly impact our end markets and has resulted and may continue to result in negative impacts on demand  increased credit and collection risks and other adverse effects on our business 
the domestic and worldwide capital and credit markets have experienced significant volatility  disruptions and dislocations with respect to price and credit availability 
these factors have caused diminished availability of credit and other capital in our end markets  including automotive and construction  and for participants in  and the customers 
table of contents of  those markets 
there is continued uncertainty as to the sustainability of the recovery of the capital and credit markets and the impact this period of volatility will have on our end markets and business in general 
further volatility in the united states or worldwide capital and credit markets may continue to significantly impact our key end markets and result in further reductions in sales volumes  increased credit and collection risks and other adverse effects on our business 
raw material pricing and availability the costs of manufacturing our products and our ability to supply our customers could be negatively impacted if we experience interruptions in deliveries of needed raw materials or supplies 
if  for any reason  our supply of flat rolled steel or other key raw materials  such as aluminum  zinc or helium  is curtailed or we are otherwise unable to obtain the quantities we need at competitive prices  our business could suffer and our financial results could be adversely affected 
such interruptions could result from a number of factors  including a shortage of capacity in the supplier base or of the raw materials  energy or the inputs needed to make steel or other supplies  a failure of suppliers to fulfill their supply or delivery obligations  financial difficulties of suppliers resulting in the closing or idling of supplier facilities  other significant events affecting supplier facilities  significant weather events  those factors listed in the immediately following paragraph or other factors beyond our control 
further  the number of suppliers has decreased in recent years due to industry consolidation and the financial difficulties of certain suppliers  and this consolidation may continue 
accordingly  if delivery from a major supplier is disrupted  it may be more difficult to obtain an alternative supply than in the past 
our future operating results may be affected by fluctuations in raw material prices  and we may be unable to pass on any increases in raw material costs to our customers 
our principal raw material is flat rolled steel  which we purchase from multiple primary steel producers 
the steel industry as a whole has been cyclical  and at times availability and pricing can be volatile due to a number of factors beyond our control 
these factors include general economic conditions  domestic and worldwide demand  the influence of hedge funds and other investment funds participating in commodity markets  curtailed production from major suppliers due to factors such as the closing or idling of facilities  accidents or equipment breakdowns  repairs or catastrophic events  labor costs or problems  competition  new laws and regulations  import duties  tariffs  energy costs  availability and cost of steel inputs eg  ore  scrap  coke and energy  currency exchange rates and other factors described in the immediately preceding paragraph 
this volatility  as well as any increases in raw material costs  could significantly affect our steel costs and adversely impact our financial results 
if our suppliers increase the prices of our critical raw materials  we may not have alternative sources of supply 
in addition  in an environment of increasing prices for steel and other raw materials  competitive conditions may impact how much of the price increases we can pass on to our customers 
to the extent we are unable to pass on future price increases in our raw materials to our customers  our financial results could be adversely affected 
also  if steel prices decrease  competitive conditions may impact how quickly we must reduce our prices to our customers  and we could be forced to use higher priced raw materials to complete orders for which the selling prices have decreased 
decreasing steel prices could also require us to write down the value of our inventory to reflect current market pricing  as was the case during fiscal inventories our business could be harmed if we fail to maintain proper inventory levels 
we are required to maintain sufficient inventories to accommodate the needs of our customers including  in many cases  short lead times and just in time delivery requirements 
although we typically have customer orders in hand prior to placement of our raw material orders for steel processing  we anticipate and forecast customer demand for each of our operating segments 
we purchase raw materials on a regular basis in an effort to maintain our inventory at levels that we believe are sufficient to satisfy the anticipated needs of our customers based upon orders  customer volume expectations  historic buying practices and market conditions 
inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in the use of higher priced inventory to fill orders reflecting lower 
table of contents selling prices  if steel prices have significantly decreased 
these events could adversely affect our financial results 
conversely  if we underestimate demand for our products or if our suppliers fail to supply quality products in a timely manner  we may experience inventory shortages 
inventory shortages could result in unfilled orders  negatively impacting our customer relationships and resulting in lost revenues  which could harm our business and adversely affect our financial results 
suppliers and customers the loss of significant volume from our key customers could adversely affect us 
in fiscal  our largest customer accounted for approximately of our consolidated net sales  and our ten largest customers accounted for approximately of our consolidated net sales 
a significant loss of  or decrease in  business from any of our key customers could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial results if we cannot obtain replacement business 
also  due to consolidation in the industries we serve  including the construction  automotive and retail industries  our sales may be increasingly sensitive to deterioration in the financial condition of  or other adverse developments with respect to  one or more of our top customers 
in addition  certain of our top customers may be able to exert pricing and other influences on us  requiring us to market  deliver and promote our products in a manner that may be more costly to us 
moreover  we generally do not have long term contracts with our customers 
as a result  although our customers periodically provide indications of their product needs and purchases  they generally purchase our products on an order by order basis  and the relationship  as well as particular orders  can be terminated at any time 
many of our key industries  such as construction and automotive  are cyclical in nature 
many of our key industries  such as construction and automotive  are cyclical and can be impacted by both market demand and raw material supply  particularly with respect to steel 
the demand for our products is directly related to  and quickly impacted by  customer demand in our industries  which can change as the result of changes in the general united states or worldwide economy and other factors beyond our control 
adverse changes in demand or pricing can have a negative effect on our business 
significant sales reductions for any of the detroit three automakers could have a negative impact on our business 
approximately half of the net sales of our steel processing operating segment and a significant amount of the net sales of certain joint ventures are to automotive related customers 
although we do sell to the domestic operations of foreign automakers  a significant portion of our automotive sales are to ford  general motors  and chrysler and their suppliers 
a reduction in sales for any of the detroit three automakers could negatively impact our business 
in addition  beginning in  automobile producers must begin complying with new corporate average fuel economy mileage requirements for new cars and light trucks that they produce 
as automakers work to produce vehicles that comply with these new standards  they may reduce the amount of steel used in cars and trucks to improve fuel economy  thereby reducing demand for steel and resulting in further over supply of steel in north america 
the closing or relocation of customer facilities could adversely affect us 
our ability to meet delivery requirements and the overall cost of our products as delivered to customer facilities are important competitive factors 
if customers close or move their production facilities further away from our manufacturing facilities which can supply them  it could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet competitive conditions  which could result in the loss of sales 
likewise  if customers move their production facilities overseas  it could result in the loss of potential sales for us 
sales conflicts with our customers and or suppliers may adversely impact us 
in some instances  we may compete with one or more of our customers and or suppliers in pursuing the same business 
such conflicts may strain our relationships with those parties  which could adversely affect our future business with them 
the closing or idling of steel manufacturing facilities could have a negative impact on us 
as steel makers have reduced their production capacities by closing or idling production lines in light of the challenging economic conditions  the number of facilities from which we can purchase steel  in particular certain specialty 
table of contents steels  has decreased 
accordingly  if delivery from a supplier is disrupted  particularly with respect to certain types of specialty steel  it may be more difficult to obtain an alternate supply than in the past 
these closures and disruptions could also have an adverse effect on our suppliers on time delivery performance  which could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our own delivery commitments and may have other adverse effects on our business 
the loss of key supplier relationships could adversely affect us 
over the years  our various manufacturing operations have developed relationships with certain steel and other suppliers which have been beneficial to us by providing more assured delivery and a more favorable all in cost  which includes price and shipping costs 
if any of those relationships were disrupted  it could have an adverse effect on delivery times and the overall cost of our raw materials  which could have a negative impact on our business 
in addition  we do not have long term contracts with any of our suppliers 
if  in the future  we are unable to obtain sufficient amounts of steel and other products at competitive prices and on a timely basis from our traditional suppliers  we may be unable to obtain these products from alternative sources at competitive prices to meet our delivery schedule  which could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations 
competition our business is highly competitive  and increased competition could negatively impact our financial results 
generally  the markets in which we conduct business are highly competitive 
our competitors include a variety of both domestic and foreign companies in all major markets 
competition for most of our products is primarily on the basis of price  product quality and our ability to meet delivery requirements 
depending on a variety of factors  including raw material  energy  labor and capital costs  government control of currency exchange rates and government subsidies of foreign steel producers  our business may be materially adversely affected by competitive forces 
the economic recession has also resulted in significant open capacity  which could attract increased competitive presence 
competition may also increase if suppliers to or customers of our industries begin to more directly compete with our businesses through acquisition or otherwise 
increased competition could cause us to lose market share  increase expenditures  lower our margins or offer additional services at a higher cost to us  which could adversely impact our financial results 
sales by competitors of light gauge metal framing products which are not code compliant could adversely affect us 
our unconsolidated metal framing joint venture  clarkdietrich  is an industry leader in driving code compliance for light gauge metal framing 
if our competitors offer cheaper products which are not code compliant  and certain customers are willing to purchase such non compliant products  it may be difficult for clarkdietrich to be cost competitive on these sales 
material substitution if steel prices increase compared to certain substitute materials  the demand for our products could be negatively impacted  which could have an adverse effect on our financial results 
in certain applications  steel competes with other materials  such as aluminum particularly in the automobile industry  cement and wood particularly in the construction industry  composites  glass and plastic 
prices of all of these materials fluctuate widely  and differences between the prices of these materials and the price of steel may adversely affect demand for our products and or encourage material substitution  which could adversely affect prices and demand for steel products 
the high cost of steel relative to other materials may make material substitution more attractive for certain uses 
freight and energy increasing energy and freight costs could increase our operating costs  which could have an adverse effect on our financial results 
the availability and cost of freight and energy  such as electricity  natural gas and diesel fuel  is important in the manufacture and transport of our products 
our operations consume substantial 
table of contents amounts of energy  and our operating costs generally increase when energy costs rise 
factors that may affect our energy costs include significant increases in fuel  oil or natural gas prices  unavailability of electrical power or other energy sources due to droughts  hurricanes or other natural causes or due to shortages resulting from insufficient supplies to serve customers  or interruptions in energy supplies due to equipment failure or other causes 
during periods of increasing energy and freight costs  we may be unable to fully recover our operating cost increases through price increases without reducing demand for our products 
our financial results could be adversely affected if we are unable to pass all of the increases on to our customers or if we are unable to obtain the necessary freight and energy 
also  increasing energy costs could put a strain on the transportation of our materials and products if the increased costs force certain transporters to close 
information systems we are subject to information system security risks and systems integration issues that could disrupt our internal operations 
we are dependent upon information technology for the distribution of information internally and also to our customers and suppliers 
this information technology is subject to damage or interruption from a variety of sources  including  without limitation  computer viruses  security breaches and defects in design 
we could also be adversely affected by system or network disruptions if new or upgraded business management systems are defective  not installed properly or not properly integrated into operations 
we recently implemented a new software based enterprise resource planning system 
various measures have been implemented to manage our risks related to information system and network disruptions  but a system failure could negatively impact our operations and financial results 
business disruptions disruptions to our business or the business of our customers or suppliers could adversely impact our operations and financial results 
business disruptions  including increased costs for  or interruptions in  the supply of energy or raw materials  resulting from shortages of supply or transportation  severe weather events such as hurricanes  tsunamis  earthquakes  tornados  floods and blizzards  casualty events such as explosions  fires or material equipment breakdown  acts of terrorism  pandemic disease  labor disruptions  the idling of facilities due to reduced demand such as resulting from the recent economic downturn or other events such as required maintenance shutdowns  could cause interruptions to our businesses as well as the operations of our customers and suppliers 
while we maintain insurance coverage that can offset some losses relating to certain types of these events  losses from business disruptions could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial results and we could be adversely impacted to the extent any such losses are not covered by insurance or cause some other adverse impact to us 
foreign operations economic  political and other risks associated with foreign operations could adversely affect our international financial results 
although the substantial majority of our business activity takes place in the united states  we derive a portion of our revenues and earnings from operations in foreign countries  and we are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally 
we have wholly owned facilities in austria  canada  the czech republic  india and portugal and joint venture facilities in china  france  india  mexico  spain and the united kingdom  and are becoming more active in exploring foreign opportunities 
the risks of doing business in foreign countries include  among other factors the potential for adverse changes in the local political climate  in diplomatic relations between foreign countries and the united states or in government policies  laws or regulations  terrorist activity that may cause social disruption  logistical and communications challenges  costs of complying with a variety of laws and regulations  difficulty in staffing and managing geographically diverse operations  deterioration of foreign economic conditions  inflation and fluctuations in interest rates  currency rate fluctuations  foreign exchange restrictions  differing local business practices and cultural considerations  restrictions on imports and exports or sources of supply  including energy and raw materials  changes in duties  quotas  tariffs  taxes or other protectionist measures  and potential issues related 
table of contents to matters covered by the foreign corrupt practices act or similar laws 
we believe that our business activities outside of the united states involve a higher degree of risk than our domestic activities  and any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
in addition  the global recession and the volatility of worldwide capital and credit markets have significantly impacted and may continue to significantly impact our foreign customers and markets 
these factors have resulted in decreased demand in our foreign operations and have had significant negative impacts on our business 
refer to the economic or industry downturns risk factor herein for additional information concerning the impact of the global recession and the volatility of capital and credit markets on our business 
joint ventures a change in the relationship between the members of any of our joint ventures may have an adverse effect on that joint venture 
we have been successful in the development and operation of various joint ventures  and our equity in net income from our joint ventures  particularly wave  has been important to our financial results 
we believe an important element in the success of any joint venture is a solid relationship between the members of that joint venture 
if there is a change in ownership  a change of control  a change in management or management philosophy  a change in business strategy or another event with respect to a member of a joint venture that adversely impacts the relationship between the joint venture members  it could adversely impact that joint venture 
in addition  joint ventures necessarily involve special risks 
whether or not we hold a majority interest or maintain operational control in a joint venture  our partners may have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our interests or goals 
for example  our partners may exercise veto rights to block actions that we believe to be in our best interests  may take action contrary to our policies or objects with respect to our investments  or may be unable or unwilling to fulfill their obligations or commitments to the joint venture 
acquisitions we may be unable to successfully consummate  manage or integrate our acquisitions 
a portion of our growth has occurred through acquisitions 
we may from time to time continue to seek attractive opportunities to acquire businesses  enter into joint ventures and make other investments that are complementary to our existing strengths 
there are no assurances  however  that any acquisition opportunities will arise or  if they do  that they will be consummated  or that any needed additional financing for such opportunities will be available on satisfactory terms when required 
in addition  acquisitions involve risks that the businesses acquired will not perform in accordance with expectations  that business judgments concerning the value  strengths and weaknesses of businesses acquired will prove incorrect  that we may assume unknown liabilities from the seller  that the acquired businesses may not be integrated successfully and that the acquisitions may strain our management resources or divert management s attention from other business concerns 
international acquisitions may present unique challenges and increase our exposure to the risks associated with foreign operations and countries 
failure to successfully integrate any of our acquisitions may cause significant operating inefficiencies and could adversely affect our operations and financial condition 
capital expenditures our business requires capital investment and maintenance expenditures  and our capital resources may not be adequate to provide for all of our cash requirements 
many of our operations are capital intensive 
for the five year period ended may   our total capital expenditures  including acquisition and investment activity  were approximately million 
additionally  at may   we were obligated to make aggregate lease payments of million under operating lease agreements 
our business also requires expenditures for maintenance of our facilities 
we currently believe that we have adequate resources including cash and cash equivalents  cash provided by operating activities  availability under existing credit facilities and unused lines of credit to meet our cash needs for normal operating costs  capital expenditures  
table of contents debt repayments  dividend payments  future acquisitions and working capital for our existing business 
however  given the current challenges  uncertainty and volatility in the domestic and global economies and financial markets  there can be no assurance that our capital resources will be adequate to provide for all of our cash requirements 
litigation we may be subject to legal proceedings or investigations  the resolution of which could negatively affect our results of operations and liquidity in a particular period 
our results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be affected by an adverse ruling in any legal proceedings or investigations which may be pending against us or filed against us in the future 
we are also subject to a variety of legal compliance risks  including  without limitation  potential claims relating to product liability  health and safety  environmental matters  intellectual property rights  taxes and compliance with us and foreign export laws  anti bribery laws  competition laws and sales and trading practices 
while we believe that we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs to address and reduce these risks  the global and diverse nature of our operations means that these risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and contingencies may arise from time to time 
a future adverse ruling or settlement or an unfavorable change in laws  rules or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or liquidity in a particular period 
for additional information regarding our pending legal proceedings and contingencies  refer to part i item legal proceedings within this annual report on form k and note e contingent liabilities and commitments to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii
