item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
the actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including  but not limited to  those presented under risk factors in item a and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we are an innovator in the field of metrology systems for the semiconductor manufacturing and other industries 
our systems are designed to precisely monitor film thickness and critical dimensions that are necessary to control the manufacturing process and provide increased production yields and performance 
capital expenditures by manufacturers of semiconductors  especially in asia  are critical to our success 
purchases of our systems by these manufacturers are driven by the expected market demand for their new products and new applications 
the increasing complexity of the manufacturing processes for semiconductors is an important factor in the demand for our innovative metrology systems  as are the adoption of optical critical dimension ocd metrology across fabrication processes  adoption of immersion lithography and double patterning  adoption of new types of thin film materials and the need for improved process control to drive process efficiencies 
our strategy is to continue to innovate organically as well to evaluate strategic acquisitions in order to address business challenges and opportunities 
our revenues are primarily derived from product sales but are also derived from customer service and system upgrades for the installed base of our products 
in  we derived of our total net revenues from product sales and of our total net revenues from services 
important themes and significant trends the semiconductor equipment industry is characterized by cyclical growth 
changing trends in the semiconductor industry continue to drive the need for metrology as a major component of manufacturing systems 
these trends include proliferation of optical critical dimension metrology across fabrication processes 
our customers use photolithographic processes to create patterns on wafers 
critical dimensions must be carefully controlled during this process 
in advanced node device definition  additional monitoring of thickness and profile dimensions on these patterned structures at cmp  etch  and thin film processing is driving broader ocd adoption 
our proprietary ocd systems can provide the critical process control of these circuit dimensions that is necessary for successful manufacturing of these state of the art devices 
nanometrics ocd technology is broadly adopted across nand  dram  hdd  and logic manufacturing processes 
adoption of advanced packaging processes our customers use photolithographic  etching  metallization  and wafer thinning to enable next generation advanced packaging solutions for semiconductor devices 
the new packages lead to increased functionality in smaller  less expensive form factors 
the advanced packages can be broken down into high density flip chip or bump packages that increase pin density allowing for more complex i o on advanced cpu parts 
additionally  similar or different devices can be stacked at the wafer level using a through silicon via process 
the tsv process enables high density small form factor parts  being primarily driven by mobile consumer products ie cellular telephones with integrated cmos camera sensors 
increasingly advanced packaging technologies are being adopted by our end customers 

table of contents adoption of new types of thin film materials 
the need for ever increasing device circuit speed coupled with lower power consumption has pushed semiconductor device manufacturers to begin the replacement of the traditional aluminum etch back interconnect flows as well as conventional gate dielectric materials  all which drive a broader adoption of thin film and ocd metrology systems 
to achieve greater semiconductor device speed  manufacturers have adopted copper in logic idm and it is now proliferating in next generation dram and flash nodes 
additionally  to achieve improved transistor performance in logic devices and higher cell densities in memory devices  new materials including high dielectric constant or high k gate materials are increasingly being substituted for traditional silicon oxide gate dielectric materials 
high k materials are comprised of complex thin films including layers of hafnium oxide and a bi layer of thin film metals 
our advanced metrology solutions are required for thickness control of these layers  which is critical to enable the device performance improvements that these new materials allow 
development of d transistor architectures 
our end customers continue to improve device density and performance by scaling front end of line transistor architectures 
many of these designs have buried features and high aspect ratio stacked features that enable improved performance and density 
the advanced designs require additional process control to manage the complex shapes and materials properties  driving additional applications for both ocd and unifire systems 
need for improved process control to drive process efficiencies 
competitive forces influencing semiconductor device manufacturers  such as price cutting and shorter product life cycles  place pressure on manufacturers to rapidly achieve production efficiency 
device manufacturers are using our integrated and automated metrology systems throughout the fabrication to ensure that manufacturing processes scale rapidly  are accurate and can be repeated on a consistent basis 
reduced number of customers 
because of the escalating cost of mm manufacturing facilities  fewer semiconductor manufacturers can afford the significant investment in these next generation facilities 
therefore  fewer opportunities for semiconductors equipment companies exist 
given that the available number of potential customers is decreasing  pre existing customer relationships  product positioning and critical mass take on greater importance 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements conforms to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which requires management to make estimates and judgments in applying our accounting policies that have an important impact on our reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses and related disclosures at the date of our financial statements 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates including those related to bad debts  inventory valuations  warranty obligations  impairment and income taxes 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from management s estimates 
we believe that the application of the following accounting policies requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management 
for a summary of all of our accounting policies  including those discussed below  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we derive revenue from the sale of process control metrology systems product revenue as well as spare part sales  billable service  service contracts  and upgrades together service revenue 
upgrades are a group of parts that change the existing configuration of a product  and are included in service revenue 
they are distinguished from product revenue  which consist of complete  automated process control metrology systems the system s 
nanometrics systems consist of hardware and of software which is incidental to the systems 
arrangements for sales of systems often include defined customer specified acceptance criteria 

table of contents for product sales to existing customers  revenue recognition occurs at the time title and risk of loss transfer  which usually occurs upon shipment from our manufacturing location  if it can be reliably demonstrated that the product has successfully met the defined customer specified acceptance criteria  and all other recognition criteria has been met 
this occurs at the time of shipment as the terms are fob shipping point 
for initial sales of product where we have not previously met the defined customer specified acceptance criteria  product revenues are recognized upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration of the contractual acceptance period 
in japan  where contractual terms with the customer specify risk of loss and title transfers upon customer acceptance  revenue is recognized upon receipt of written customer acceptance  provided that all other recognition criteria have been met 
upon recognition of product revenue  a liability is recorded for anticipated warranty costs 
as part of customer service  we also sell software that is considered to be an upgrade to the customer s existing system 
such software is specific to the type of tool being upgraded and cannot be used in other tools 
software is not a significant focus of our product offerings and marketing efforts  and we do not provide post sale customer service with respect to the software that we sell 
revenue on software upgrades is recognized when the software is delivered to the customer  provided that all other recognition criteria have been met 
all of our products are assembled prior to shipment to customers 
we often perform installation for our customers  however such an installation is inconsequential and perfuntctory  and could be provided by outside third parties and is not considered essential to the functionality of the equipment 
revenue related to spare part sales is recognized upon shipment 
revenue related to billable service is recognized as the services are performed  and  if billable service and spare parts are sold together  revenue is recognized when the parts are delivered and the service is complete 
service contracts may be purchased by the customer during or after the warranty period and revenue is recognized ratably over the service contract period 
revenue on upgrades including software upgrades is recognized when the upgrade has been delivered to the customer 
for initial upgrade sales where we have not previously met the defined customer specified acceptance criteria  if any  revenue is recognized upon earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or the expiration of the contractual acceptance period 
on occasion  customers request a warranty period longer than our standard month warranty  in those instances  the associated revenue is deferred and recognized as service revenue ratably over the term of the contract 
the portion of service contracts and extended warranty services agreements that are uncompleted at the end of any reporting period are included in deferred revenue 
we generally do not provide customers with any return rights 
in cases where we can ascertain the fair value of all the elements  and certain elements of a sales arrangement are not delivered and accepted at the same time  the relative fair value of the undelivered element is deferred until that element is delivered and accepted by the customer 
in multiple element arrangements where we only have fair value of the undelivered elements  the residual method is applied 
in order to recognize revenue associated with delivered elements  the following criteria must be met a the delivered item s has value to the customer on a standalone basis  b there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item s  and c delivery or performance of the undelivered item s is considered probable and is substantially in our control 
if the arrangement does not meet all the above criteria  the entire amount of the sales contract is deferred until the above criteria have been met or all elements have been delivered to the customer 
objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of an element is based on the amounts for which we sell equivalent products or services on a standalone basis 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make their required payments 
credit limits are established through a process of reviewing the financial history and stability of our customers 
where appropriate and available  we obtain credit rating reports and financial statements of customers when determining or modifying their credit limits 
we regularly evaluate the collectability of our trade receivable balances based on a combination of factors such as the length of time the receivables are past due  customary payment practices in the respective geographies and our historical collection experience with customers 
we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts adequately reflects our risk associated with our receivables 
if however  the financial conditions of customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  we would assess the necessity of recording additional allowances 
this would result in additional general and administrative expenses being recorded for the period in which such determination was made 

table of contents inventories inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis  or market 
we are exposed to a number of economic and industry specific factors that could result in portions of our inventory becoming either obsolete or in excess of anticipated usage  or saleable only for amounts that are less than their carrying amounts 
these factors include  but are not limited to  technological changes in our market  our ability to meet changing customer requirements  competitive pressures in products and prices  and the availability of key components from our suppliers 
we have established inventory reserves when conditions exist that suggest that our inventory may be in excess of anticipated demand or is obsolete based upon our assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions 
once a reserve has been established  it is maintained until the part to which it relates is sold or is otherwise disposed off 
we regularly evaluate our ability to realize the value of our inventory based on a combination of factors including the following historical usage rates  forecasted sales of usage  product end of life dates  estimated current and future market values and new product introductions 
for demonstration inventory  we also consider the age of the inventory and potential cost to refurbish the inventory prior to sale 
demonstration inventory is amortized over its useful life and the amortization expense is included in total depreciation and amortization on our cash flow statement 
when recorded  our reserves are intended to reduce the carrying value of our inventory to its net realizable value 
if actual demand for our products deteriorates  or market conditions are less favorable than those that we project  additional reserves may be required 
product warranties we sell the majority of our products with a standard twelve month repair or replacement warranty from the date of acceptance or shipment date 
we provide an accrual for estimated future warranty costs based upon the historical relationship of warranty costs to the cost of products sold 
the estimated future warranty obligations related to product sales are reported in the period in which the related revenue is recognized 
the estimated future warranty obligations are affected by the warranty periods  sales volumes  product failure rates  material usage and labor and replacement costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
if actual product failure rates  material usage  labor or replacement costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty obligations would be required 
for new product introductions where limited or no historical information exists  we may use warranty information from other previous product introductions to guide us in estimating our warranty accrual 
the warranty accrual represents the best estimate of the amount necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
we periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty reserve and adjust the amounts in accordance with changes in these factors 
goodwill and intangible assets intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their useful lives while goodwill and indefinite lived assets are not amortized but tested annually for impairment 
our impairment review process is completed as of the last day of november of each year or whenever events or circumstances occur which indicate that an impairment may have occurred 
the relevant accounting standard provides for a two step approach to determining whether and how much goodwill has been impaired 
the first step requires a comparison of the fair value of nanometrics reporting units to its net book value 
if the fair value is greater  then no impairment is deemed to have occurred 
if the fair value is less  then the second step must be performed to determine the amount  if any  of actual impairment 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment 
in estimating the fair value of goodwill for the company s reporting units  we make estimates and judgments about future revenues and cash flows for each reporting unit 
to determine the fair value  our review process includes the income method and is based on a discounted future cash flow approach that uses estimates including the following for each reporting unit revenue  based on assumed market growth rates and our assumed market share  estimated costs  and appropriate discount rates based on the particular reporting unit s weighted average cost of capital 
our estimates of market segment growth  our market segment share and costs are based on historical data  various internal estimates and certain external sources  and are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 
our business consists of both established and emerging technologies and our forecasts for emerging technologies are based upon internal estimates and external sources rather than historical information 
we also consider our market capitalization on the dates of our impairment tests in determining the fair value of the respective businesses 
as part of the second step in determining the amount of goodwill impairment  if any  we allocate the fair value of the reporting units to all of their assets and liabilities as if the reporting units had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting units was the price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
the excess of the fair value of each reporting unit over the amount assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
when impairment is deemed to have occurred  we will recognize an impairment charge to reduce the carrying amount of our goodwill to its implied fair value  and in the fiscal year we wrote off the entire million of our goodwill 
there was no goodwill at the end of fiscal years and 
table of contents income tax assets and liabilities we account for income taxes such that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax accounting for assets and liabilities 
also  deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized in the future 
we evaluate the deferred tax assets on a periodic basis to determine whether or not a valuation allowance is appropriate 
factors used in this determination include future expected income and the underlying asset or liability which generated the temporary tax difference 
our income tax provision is primarily impacted by federal statutory rates  state and foreign income taxes and changes in our valuation allowance 
stock based compensation we estimate the value of employee stock options on the date of grant using the black scholes model 
the determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
the expected term of options granted is calculated based on the simplified method 
the expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock price 
restructuring charges there was no restructuring or related charges during the fiscal year during the fiscal years and  we implemented restructuring programs based on our business strategy and recorded significant accruals in connection with the restructuring program 
in connection with the plan we have recorded estimated expenses for severance and other costs 
costs associated with restructuring activities are recognized when they are incurred rather than the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan in accordance with asc a liability for post employment benefits is incurred when payment is probable  the amount is reasonably estimable  and the obligation relates to rights that have vested or accumulated 
given the significance and complexity of restructuring activities  and the timing of the execution of such activities  the restructuring process involves periodic reassessments of the estimates made at the time the original decisions were made  including evaluating market conditions for expected disposals of assets and vacancy of space 
recent accounting pronouncements see note of the consolidated financial statements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements  including the respective dates of adoption and effects on our results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents results of operations the following table presents our consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of total net revenues for fiscal years ended january   january  and december  fiscal year net revenues products service total net revenues costs of net revenues cost of products cost of service total costs of net revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development selling general and administrative amortization of intangibles restructuring charge asset impairment total operating expenses income loss from operations other income expense interest income interest expense other  net total other income expense  net income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss fiscal years  and ended january   january   and december   respectively total net revenues 
our net revenues were comprised of the following product lines in thousands  except percent fiscal year change automated systems integrated systems materials characterization total product revenue service total net revenues 
table of contents fiscal year change automated systems integrated systems materials characterization total product revenue service total net revenues in the revenue from products increased by million over the previous year  most of it attributable to increased capital spending by our customers as the global economy started to turn around 
about million of this increase was attributable to automated systems atlas  nanogen  caliper mosaic  lynx and lithos  materials characterization tools accounted for million of this increase and million increase in the integrated metrology systems 
service revenue increased by million in fiscal year  compared to fiscal year  a significant portion of this increase was due to increased parts sales of million 
in  net revenues from automated systems decreased by million compared to the comparable period in  which decreases were primarily the result of a global reduction in capital spending by semiconductor manufacturers  though in the third and fourth quarters of  we experienced an increase in revenues in automated metrology  in part due to increases in multi system orders and technology upgrades in both the memory and logic sections  strong sales of our thin film and ocd systems  increasing demand for our caliper mosaic overlay product  and further penetration into high growth segments such as high brightness leds 
in  integrated systems decreased by million when compared to due primarily to reduced market demand 
sales of our integrated systems are highly dependent on  and driven by  manufacturing companies expanding their capacity 
given the global economic conditions  manufacturing companies were not expanding their capacity  and therefore  sales of our systems to these companies declined 
service revenue improved by million over the comparable period in  primarily due to higher in the field tool upgrades 
gross margins 
our gross margin breakdown was as follows fiscal year products service the margin on products increased significantly in compared to  a increase from to 
improved margins of were related to higher sales volume levels  which resulted in higher favorable absorption of manufacturing costs and lower warranty expense which was partially offset by royalties 
the balance of the product margin improvement of was related to increased product margins due to a more favorable product mix of higher margin products 
the margins on service revenue decreased from in to in this decrease was attributable to a decline in margins on upgrades and also due to cost increases for ramping up the size of the service organization infrastructure to support higher volume of sales 
the product gross margin in compared to  decreased from to 
reduced margins of were related to lower absorption of manufacturing costs at lower revenue and volume level and higher warranty costs 
offsetting the unfavorable reductions in margin  was a improvement in margin due to sales mix favoring higher margin products service gross margin improved in from to due to a significant increase in service upgrade revenues  which have a higher gross margin relative to our core service revenues 
the continued operation of our core service department in a more efficient manner  including improvements to our job scheduling process also contributed to the improvement of our service gross margins 

table of contents operating expenses 
our operating expenses were comprised of the following categories in thousands fiscal year change research and development selling general and administrative amortization of intangible assets operating expenses before restructuring or impairment restructuring charge asset impairment total operating expenses fiscal year change research and development selling general and administrative amortization of intangible assets operating expenses before restructuring or impairment restructuring charge asset impairment total operating expenses research and development 
research and development costs increased by million or in the fiscal year when compared to  this increase was a result of million increase in labor and consulting costs and million increase in cost of facilities 
research and development costs decreased by million or in fiscal year when compared to  primarily due to lower labor costs of million as a result of headcount reduction from to  respectively  and forced time off  and a million reduction in travel costs 
selling 
selling and marketing expenses increased by million or in fiscal year  when compared to higher costs are a result of increased labor costs of million including increases in salaries  bonus  commission  severance and stock based compensation and a million increase in travel expenses

general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased by million or in fiscal year  compared to  increases were the result result of million in bonuses to executive officers  increased salaries of million attributed also to increased head count  a million increase in stock based compensation and million increase in the cost of facilities 
general and administrative expenses decreased by million or in fiscal year  when compared to  primarily due to lower labor costs of million as a result of headcount reduction from to  respectively  and forced time off in  lower stock based compensation of million  lower costs associated with regulatory and compliance accounting of million  and lower travel costs of million  offset by increased legal fees of million primarily related to the zygo acquisition  ongoing litigation and the option exchange program 

table of contents amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangibles assets in fiscal year was consistent and comparable to  however  amortization in fiscal year had decreased by million from the comparable period in  primarily as a result of an impairment charge taken against these assets in restructuring charge 
there were no restructuring charges in the restructuring process was completed in fiscal year  hence there were no restructuring charges in  conversely  as a result of increases in revenue due to the increased capital spending in the semiconductor industry  we increased our headcount 
restructuring costs decreased by million in fiscal year compared to fiscal year the restructuring charges associated with and employees respectively for the first and second quarter of were million and million 
twelve of the employees terminated in the second quarter of were in connection with the closure of our south korea manufacturing facility 
the higher restructuring costs in  compared to  were attributed to workforce reduction of higher salaried and longer tenure employees 
asset impairment 
during the fiscal year  we recognized impairment charges of million related to write offs of various it projects  versus an impairment charge of million that was recognized in fiscal year related to the closure of our south korea manufacturing facility  during the challenging economic conditions facing the semiconductor industry 
during the fiscal year  we recognized an impairment charge of million  representing a write off of the entire amount of our previously recorded goodwill  and an impairment charge million was recorded to reflect certain brand names and developed technology intangible assets at their fair value 
we also recorded an impairment charge of million to account for machine shop related assets at its fair value 
operating income loss 
our operating income in fiscal year was million  compared to a million loss from operations in fiscal year the improved operating margin was a result of increased revenues  improved gross margin and controlled operating expenses 
other income expense 
our net other income expense consisted of the following categories in thousands fiscal year change interest income interest expense other income expense   nm total other income expense  net   nm nm not meaningful fiscal year change interest income interest expense other income expense    nm total other income expense  net    nm nm not meaningful 
table of contents during fiscal year our interest expenses were relatively flat compared to fiscal year  the marginal decrease is attributed to pay down of million on the mortgage related to our headquarter premises  as described below 
other income increased million  due to a million reduction in loss on foreign exchange from million loss in fiscal year to million gain in fiscal year  and also due to million change to the fair value of deferred payments to zygo corporation related to our acquisition of certain assets and entry into a supply agreement with zygo corporation from million increase in liability in fiscal year  to a million decrease in fiscal year and million gain on sale of assets compared to we incurred higher interest expenses in fiscal year from the comparable period in due to the company s borrowing of million in connection with a mortgage against our headquarter premises entered into during july and the imputed interest of million on fair value of deferred payments to zygo corporation related to our acquisition of certain assets and entry into a supply agreement with zygo corporation 
we incurred foreign exchange loss of million due to exchange rate fluctuations associated with our intercompany balances among our various global entities 
provision benefit for income taxes 
the company s benefit for income taxes for of million was primarily due to the decrease in the deferred income tax valuation allowance against us and japan deferred tax assets and fully utilizing the company s federal net operating loss carry forwards during the company s benefit for income taxes for of million was primarily a result of release of foreign income tax reserves and benefiting from refundable tax credits in the united states and united kingdom 
a provision for income taxes for of million was primarily a result of foreign income taxes 
our effective tax rate was   and in  and  respectively 
the company maintains valuation allowances when it is likely that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in the company s income tax provision in the period of change 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted  the company takes into account such factors as prior earnings history  expected future earnings  unsettled circumstances that  if unfavorably resolved  would adversely affect utilization of a deferred tax asset  carry back and carry forward periods  and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset 
net income loss 
our net income for the fiscal year was million  compared to a net loss of million in fiscal year  this was primarily due to the cumulative effect of increased revenues  leading to increased profits and improved absorption of manufacturing costs  as well as due to a one time release benefit of income tax valuation allowance  which contributed million 
liquidity and capital resources at january   our cash and cash equivalents totaled million and working capital was million  compared to million cash as of january  and working capital of million  respectively 
operations cash provided by operations was million which was the result of net income of million  partially offset by non cash transactions of million and million of changes in working capital 
non cash transactions primarily consisted of i million net tax benefit  primarily consisting of a million release of income tax valuation allowance  ii stock based compensation of million  iii depreciation  amortization and impairment expense of million  and iv increases in inventory and warranty reserves of million 
changes in working capital were mostly due to a million increase in receivables due to higher revenue and timing of collections  an increase of million in inventory and a million increase in payables and accruals as a result of better cash management 
operating activities used cash of million for the twelve month period ended january  primarily as a result of our net loss of million  offset by certain non cash charges including million amortization and depreciation  million of asset impairment  and million of stock based compensation 
operating activities provided cash of million for the twelve month period ended december  resulting from our million net loss being offset by certain non cash charges including million of impairment charges for long lived assets  million of amortization and depreciation and million in stock based compensation  and increases attributable to changes in our net current assets and liabilities of million 

table of contents investing during the year ended january   investing activities used million of cash  of which  million was for purchases of capital equipment and patents and million was paid to zygo related to payments for inventories and fixed assets for the unifire acquisition 
these were offset by million of cash received from the sale of assets  primarily related to the sale of the south korean manufacturing facility

proceeds were from the issuance of million of debt  and million from the sale of stock from employee stock plans and purchase plan and were offset by million used for the repurchase of our common stock and million for debt payments 
in december  we completed a public offering of our common stock resulting in the net proceeds of million 
the company used million of the net proceeds from the offering to repay certain obligations related to the company s acquisition of certain assets of zygo corporation in june  with the remainder used for general corporate purposes  including working capital 
in february  we entered into a two year agreement for a revolving line of credit facility in a maximum principal amount of million 
on april   we re negotiated to extend the maturity date of the revolving line of credit facility by an additional two years  to april  on june   we amended the financial covenants governing the credit facility to reduce the tangible net worth requirements  effective as of june  on april   we amended the revolving line of credit facility to i increase the maximum principal amount available there under from million to million  ii extend the maturity date of such facility by one year to april   and iii decrease the unused revolving line commitment fee from per annum to per annum 
the instrument governing the facility includes certain financial covenants regarding net tangible net worth 
the revolving line of credit agreement includes a provision for the issuance of commercial or standby letters of credit by the bank on our behalf 
the value of all letters of credit outstanding reduces the total line of credit available 
the revolving line of credit is collateralized by a blanket lien on all of our domestic assets excluding intellectual property and real estate 
the minimum borrowing interest rate is per annum 
the maximum borrowing allowed on the line of credit is million 
borrowing is limited to the lesser of a million plus the borrowing base or b million 
the borrowing base available as of january  was million 
as of january   we were not in breach of any restrictive covenants in connection with our line of credit and debt obligations 
there are no outstanding amounts drawn on this facility as of january  although we have no current plans to request advances under this credit facility  we may use the proceeds of any future borrowing for general corporate purposes  future acquisitions or expansion of our business 

table of contents there no drawings on or payments to the line of credit during the fiscal year we borrowed million during fiscal year and also repaid the amounts in full during fiscal year in july  we entered into a loan agreement pursuant to which we borrowed million  the loan is secured  in part  by a lien on and security interest in the building and land comprising our principal offices in milpitas  california 
the loan initially bears interest at the rate of per annum  which rate will be reset in august to over the weekly average yield of five year u 
s dollar interest rate swaps as published by the federal reserve 
monthly principal and interest payments are based on a twenty year amortization for the first sixty months and fifteen year amortization thereafter 
the remaining principal balance of the loan and any accrued but unpaid interest will be due on august  on june   we announced a strategic business partnership with zygo corporation whereby nanometrics has purchased inventory and certain other assets from zygo corporation and the two companies have entered into a supply agreement 
the company will make payments to zygo corporation with an estimated present value of million as of january  over a period of time as acquired inventory is sold and other aspects of the supply agreement are executed 
a payment of million of inventory and fixed assets was made to zygo corporation on january   in accordance with the terms of the acquisition agreement 
we have evaluated and will continue to evaluate the acquisitions of products  technologies or business that are complementary to our business 
these activities may result in product and business investments  which may affect our cash position and working capital balances 
some of these activities might require significant cash outlays 
additionally  in the third quarter of  our board of directors authorized a million stock repurchase program  we utilized the remaining million under this program to repurchase the company stock 
the board of directors authorized another million stock repurchase program in the fourth quarter of  of this  we have utilized million 
we believe our cash  cash equivalents and borrowing availability will be sufficient to meet our needs through at least the next twelve months 
off balance sheet arrangements none 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of january   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years debt obligations fair value of deferred payments to zygo corporation related to acquisition other long term liabilities operating lease obligations total includes interest 
we maintain certain open inventory purchase agreements with our suppliers to ensure a smooth and continuous supply chain for key components 
our liability under these purchase commitments is generally restricted to a forecasted time horizon as mutually agreed upon between the parties 
this forecast time horizon can vary among different suppliers 
we estimate our open inventory purchase commitment as of january  was approximately million 
actual expenditures will vary based upon the volume of the transactions and length of contractual service provided 
in addition  the amounts paid under these arrangements may be less in the event that the arrangements are renegotiated or cancelled 
certain agreements provide for potential cancellation penalties 
excluded from the contractual obligation table above  are million of future payments related to uncertain tax positions because we cannot reliably estimate the timing of the settlements with the respective tax authorities
