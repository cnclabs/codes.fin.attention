item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis represents a review of the corporation s consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
this review should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements beginning on page f overview the corporation reported an increase in net income available to common stockholders of million for as consolidated net income available to common stockholders amounted to million or per common share for  compared to net income of million or per common share for net income available to common stockholders was impacted by the following net interest income increased million or in this increase was primarily attributed to an increase in interest earned on loans receivable and securities of  and  respectively 
further contributing to the increase in net interest income  interest expense on deposits decreased by  due primarily to the continued low interest rate environment 
noninterest income increased million or primarily due to an increase in net securities gains to million in from a net loss of  in of the gains   related to a capital management strategy whereby the corporation sold million of securities to prepay million of long term fhlb advances 
these gains were used to offset the  prepayment penalty associated with the early redemption of the advances 
during  the corporation realized an other than temporary impairment otti charge of  related to the decline in value in certain of the corporation equity securities  which consisted of common stock positions held in various smaller local financial institutions 
noninterest expense increased million or primarily related to the following increased compensation  premises and other noninterest costs associated with the titusville office  acquired during the third quarter of increased compensation expense due to the reinstatement of previously suspended incentive programs 
the programs were previously suspended as the corporation set forth initiatives to maintain capital 
one time prepayment fees totaling  related to the repayment of long term fhlb advances 
increased intangible amortization related to the third quarter titusville branch acquisition 
professional fees decreased  or to  in from million in the corporation incurred non recurring professional fees of  and  in relating to the purchase of the titusville branch office and a common stock offering  respectively 
k changes in financial condition total assets increased million or to million at december  from million at december  this increase was due primarily to increases in securities available for sale  net loans receivable and cash and equivalents of million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in the corporation s total assets was primarily funded by increases in total liabilities of million or and total stockholders equity of million or 
the increase in total liabilities was primarily due to an increase in total deposits of million or  partially offset by a decrease in borrowed funds of million or 
cash and cash equivalents 
these accounts decreased a combined million or to million at december  from million at december  this decrease was primarily due to the full deployment of cash received from the titusville branch purchase transaction 
typically  cash accounts are increased by net operating results  deposits by customers into savings and checking accounts  loan and security repayments and proceeds from borrowed funds 
decreases result from customer deposit withdrawals  new loan originations or other loan fundings  security purchases  repayments of borrowed funds and cash dividends to stockholders 
securities 
securities increased million or to million at december  from million at december  this increase was primarily related to the deployment of cash received from both the aforementioned titusville branch acquisition and increased customer deposits into higher yielding investment securities  offset by security calls  sales and repayments during the year 
loans receivable 
net loans receivable increased million or to million at december  from million at december  as residential first mortgages increased million or  commercial real estate increased million or  commercial business increased million or and consumer loans increased  or  partially offset by a million or decrease in home equity loans and lines of credit 
non performing assets 
non performing assets include non accrual loans  loans days past due and still accruing  repossessions and real estate owned 
non performing assets were million or of total assets at december  compared to million or of total assets at december  non performing assets consisted of non performing loans  repossessions and real estate owned of million  and  respectively  at december  and million   and  respectively  at december  at december   non performing assets consisted primarily of consumer  commercial mortgage and commercial business loans 
federal bank stocks 
federal bank stocks were comprised of fhlb stock and frb stock of million and  respectively  at december  these stocks are purchased and redeemed at par as directed by the federal banks and levels maintained are based primarily on borrowing and other correspondent relationships between the corporation and the banks 
in december  the fhlb notified member banks that it was suspending dividend payments and the repurchase of capital stock  however  in october  the fhlb repurchased  of the bank s capital stock 
management evaluated the fhlb stock for impairment and determined that no impairment charge was necessary as of december  bank owned life insurance boli 
the corporation maintains single premium life insurance policies on current and former officers and employees of the bank 
in addition to providing life insurance coverage  whereby the bank as well as the officers and employees receive life insurance benefits  the appreciation of the cash surrender value of the boli will serve to offset and finance existing and future employee benefit costs 
increases in this account during were associated with an increase in the cash surrender value of the policies  partially offset by certain administrative expenses 
k premises and equipment 
premises and equipment was million at december  and the overall increase in premises and equipment during the year was due to capital expenditures of  partially offset by normal depreciation and amortization of  major capital expenditures during the year included  for the purchase of the titusville office building which had previously been leased since august goodwill 
goodwill was million at december  and goodwill is evaluated for possible impairment at least annually  and more frequently  if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
management evaluated goodwill and concluded that no impairment existed at december  core deposit intangible 
the core deposit intangible was million at december  in connection with the assumption of deposits through the titusville branch purchase  the bank recorded a core deposit intangible of million 
this asset represents the long term value of the core deposits acquired 
fair value was determined using a third party valuation expert specializing in estimating fair values of core deposit intangibles 
the fair value was derived using an industry standard financial instrument present value methodology 
all in costs and runoff balances by year were discounted by comparable term fhlb advance rates  used as an alternative cost of funds measure 
this intangible asset amortizes utilizing the double declining balance method of amortization over a weighted average estimated life of nine years 
the core deposit intangible asset is not estimated to have a significant residual value 
the corporation recorded  and  of intangible amortization in and  respectively 
deposits 
total deposits increased million or to million at december  from million at december  noninterest bearing deposits increased million or during the year and interest bearing deposits increased million or 
borrowed funds 
borrowed funds decreased million or to million at december  from million at december  due to the aforementioned prepayment of million of long term fhlb advances 
stockholders equity 
stockholders equity increased million or to million at december  from million at december  resulting primarily from an increase in retained earnings totaling million related to net income less preferred and common stock dividends  the reissue of  shares of treasury stock and an increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss totaling  resulting from a change in the funded status of the corporation s defined benefit plan and net unrealized losses on securities available for sale 
k changes in results of operations the corporation reported net income before accumulated preferred stock dividends and discount accretion of million and million in and  respectively 
the following average balance sheet and yield rate analysis and analysis of changes in net interest income tables should be utilized in conjunction with the discussion of the net interest income and interest expense components of net income 
average balance sheet and yield rate analysis 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  information concerning the total dollar amounts of interest income from interest earning assets and the resulting average yields  the total dollar amounts of interest expense on interest bearing liabilities and the resulting average costs  net interest income  interest rate spread and the net interest margin earned on average interest earning assets 
for purposes of this table  average loan balances include non accrual loans and exclude the allowance for loan losses and interest income includes accretion of net deferred loan fees 
interest and yields on tax exempt loans and securities tax exempt for federal income tax purposes are shown on a fully tax equivalent basis 
the information is based on average daily balances during the periods presented

the following table analyzes the changes in interest income and interest expense in terms of changes in volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and changes in yields and rates 
the table reflects the extent to which changes in the corporation s interest income and interest expense are attributable to changes in rate change in rate multiplied by prior year volume  changes in volume changes in volume multiplied by prior year rate and changes attributable to the combined impact of volume rate change in rate multiplied by change in volume 
the changes attributable to the combined impact of volume rate are allocated on a consistent basis between the volume and rate variances 
changes in interest income on loans and securities reflect the changes in interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis 
versus increase decrease due to dollar amounts in thousands volume rate total interest income loans securities interest earning deposits with banks federal bank stocks total interest earning assets interest expense deposits borrowed funds total interest bearing liabilities net interest income results compared to results the corporation reported net income before accumulated preferred stock dividends and discount accretion of million and million for and  respectively 
the million or increase in net income was attributed to increases in net interest income and noninterest income of million and million  respectively  and a decrease in provision for loan losses of  partially offset by increases in noninterest expense and provision for income taxes of million and  respectively 
net interest income 
the primary source of the corporation s revenue is net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income on earning assets such as loans and securities  and interest expense on liabilities  such as deposits and borrowed funds  used to fund the earning assets 
net interest income is impacted by the volume and composition of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and changes in the level of interest rates 
tax equivalent net interest income increased million to million for  compared to million for this increase in net interest income can be attributed to an increase in tax equivalent interest income of million and a decrease in interest expense of  interest income 
tax equivalent interest income increased million or to million for  compared to million for this increase can be attributed to increases in interest earned on loans  securities and federal bank stocks of  million  and  partially offset by a decrease in interest earning deposits of  tax equivalent interest earned on loans receivable increased  or to million for  compared to million for during that time  average loans increased million or  generating  of additional loan interest income 
offsetting this favorable asset growth  the yield on loans decreased basis points to for  versus for causing a  decrease in interest income 
k tax equivalent interest earned on securities increased million or to million for  compared to million for during this time  average securities increased million or accounting for million in additional security interest income 
this increase was primarily related to the full deployment of cash received from the titusville branch purchase and customer deposits into higher yielding investment securities 
the average yield on securities decreased basis points to for  versus for primarily due to calls of certain higher rate securities and the subsequent deployment of proceeds into shorter termed  lower yielding investments 
interest earned on interest earning deposit accounts decreased  or to  for  compared to  for average interest earning deposits decreased million or primarily related to the deployment of remaining cash received from the titusville branch acquisition 
this decrease caused a  decrease in interest income 
the average yield decreased basis points resulting in a  decrease in interest income 
interest earned on federal bank stocks increased  or to  for  compared to  for interest expense 
interest expense decreased  or to million for  compared to million for this decrease can be attributed to decreases in interest incurred on interest bearing deposits and borrowed funds of  and  respectively 
deposit interest expense decreased  or to million for  compared to million for declines in market interest rates caused the rate on interest bearing deposits to decrease by basis points to for versus for accounting for a million decrease in interest expense 
average interest bearing deposits increased million or  primarily due to deposits 
this increase accounted for million in additional interest expense 
interest expense on borrowed funds decreased  or to million for and average borrowed funds decreased million or accounting for a decrease in interest expense of the average rate on borrowed funds increased basis points to for versus for this increase in rate accounted for  of additional interest expense 
provision for loan losses 
the corporation records provisions for loan losses to maintain a level of total allowance for loan losses that management believes  to the best of its knowledge  covers all probable incurred losses estimable at each reporting date 
management considers historical loss experience  the present and prospective financial condition of borrowers  current conditions particularly as they relate to markets where the corporation originates loans  the status of non performing assets  the estimated underlying value of the collateral and other factors related to the collectability of the loan portfolio 
the provision for loan losses decreased  to million for  compared to million for the corporation s allowance for loan losses amounted to million or of the corporation s total loan portfolio at december   compared to million or at december  the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of non performing loans at december  and was and  respectively 
the change in the allowance for loan losses to total loans and the allowance for loans losses to non performing loans occurred as the corporation s non performing loans increased to million at december  from million at december  the increase in non performing loans resulted primarily from the addition of four separate credit relationships which were placed on non accrual status during the year due to deterioration in the financial condition of the borrowers  as a result of poor economic conditions  and a general decline in their ability to comply with contractual repayment terms on a timely basis 
while non performing loans increased significantly  the provision for loan losses decreased slightly year over year as the corporation recognized a  recovery of a previously charged off commercial real estate loan 
this recovery decreased the corporation s historical loss experience and resulted in an overall reduction in general reserves allocated to this portfolio segment 
in addition  due to the estimated value of the collateral supporting the loans placed on non accrual status during the year  the corporation generally did not require significant additional provision for impaired loans 
k noninterest income 
noninterest income includes revenue that is not related to interest rates  but rather to services rendered and activities conducted in the financial services industry  including fees on depository accounts  general transaction and service fees  commissions on financial services  title premiums  security and loan gains and losses  and earnings on boli 
noninterest income increased million or to million for  compared to million for this increase was primarily due to an increase in net gains on securities available for sale from a net loss of  in to a net gain of million in included in the gains   related to a capital management strategy whereby million of securities were sold to prepay long term fhlb advances 
these gains were used to offset the  prepayment penalty associated with the early redemption of the advances 
during and  other than temporary impairment charges totaling  and  respectively  were realized related to the decline in value in certain marketable equity securities  which consisted of common stock positions held in various financial institutions 
noninterest expense 
noninterest expense increased million or to million for  compared to million for this increase in noninterest expense was comprised of increases in compensation and employee benefits  premises and equipment  intangible amortization and other expenses  partially offset by a decrease in professional fees and fdic insurance 
the largest component of noninterest expense  compensation and employee benefits  increased  or to million for  compared to million for this increase was primarily related to increased compensation associated with the titusville office  which was acquired in the third quarter of  normal compensation increases and the reinstatement of the previously suspended incentive programs 
premises and equipment expense increased  or to million for  compared to million for  primarily related to costs associated with the full year operation of the titusville office purchased during the third quarter of the corporation recognized  of intangible amortization in compared to  in associated with a core deposit intangible asset of million that was recorded related to the titusville office purchase transaction 
professional fees decreased  or to  for  compared to million for this decreased as the corporation incurred non recurring professional fees of  and  in related to the purchase of the titusville office and a common stock offering  respectively 
fdic expense decreased  or to  for  compared to  for this was primarily the result of a  special assessment that was assessed on all fdic insured depository institutions in other noninterest expense increased  or to million for  compared to million for due primarily to one time prepayment fees totaling  related to the aforementioned prepayment of fhlb long term advances 
the provision for income taxes increased  to  for  compared to  for due to higher pre tax income 
additionally  the effective tax rate increased year over year attributable to a greater portion of pre tax income generated from tax exempt investment securities and loans during k market risk management market risk for the corporation consists primarily of interest rate risk exposure and liquidity risk 
the corporation is not subject to currency exchange risk or commodity price risk  and has no trading portfolio  and therefore  is not subject to any trading risk 
in addition  the corporation does not participate in hedging transactions such as interest rate swaps and caps 
changes in interest rates will impact both income and expense recorded and also the market value of long term interest earning assets 
the primary objective of the corporation s asset liability management function is to maximize the corporation s net interest income while simultaneously maintaining an acceptable level of interest rate risk given the corporation s operating environment  capital and liquidity requirements  balance sheet mix  performance objectives and overall business focus 
one of the primary measures of the exposure of the corporation s earnings to interest rate risk is the timing difference between the repricing or maturity of interest earning assets and the repricing or maturity of its interest bearing liabilities 
the corporation s board of directors has established a finance committee  consisting of four outside directors  the president and chief executive officer ceo  treasurer and chief financial officer cfo and principal accounting officer pao  to monitor market risk  including primarily interest rate risk 
this committee  which meets at least quarterly  generally establishes and monitors the investment  interest rate risk and asset liability management policies established by the corporation 
in order to minimize the potential for adverse affects of material and prolonged changes in interest rates on the corporation s results of operations  the corporation s management has implemented and continues to monitor asset liability management policies to better match the maturities and repricing terms of the corporation s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
such policies have consisted primarily of i originating adjustable rate mortgage loans  ii originating short term secured commercial loans with the rate on the loan tied to the prime rate or reset features in which the rate changes at determined intervals  iii emphasizing investment in shorter term years or less investment securities  iv selling longer term year fixed rate residential mortgage loans in the secondary market  v maintaining a high level of liquid assets including securities classified as available for sale that can be readily reinvested in higher yielding investments should interest rates rise  vi emphasizing the retention of lower costing savings accounts and other core deposits  and vii lengthening liabilities and locking in lower borrowing rates with longer terms whenever possible 
interest rate sensitivity gap analysis the implementation of asset and liability initiatives and strategies and compliance with related policies  combined with other external factors such as demand for the corporation s products and economic and interest rate environments in general  has resulted in the corporation maintaining a one year cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap ranging between a positive and negative of total assets 
the one year interest rate sensitivity gap is identified as the difference between the corporation s interest earning assets that are scheduled to mature or reprice within one year and its interest bearing liabilities that are scheduled to mature or reprice within one year 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities  and is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets 
generally  during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would adversely affect net interest income while a positive gap would result in an increase in net interest income 
conversely  during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would result in an increase in net interest income and a positive gap would adversely affect net interest income 
the closer to zero  or more neutral  that gap is maintained  generally  the lesser the impact of market interest rate changes on net interest income 
k based on certain assumptions provided by a federal regulatory agency  which management believes most accurately represents the sensitivity of the corporation s assets and liabilities to interest rate changes  at december   the corporation s interest earning assets maturing or repricing within one year totaled million while the corporation s interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within one year totaled million  providing an excess of interest earning assets over interest bearing liabilities of million or of total assets 
at december   the percentage of the corporation s assets to liabilities maturing or repricing within one year was 
the following table presents the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding as of december  which are expected to mature  prepay or reprice in each of the future time periods presented due in due within due within due within due in six months six months one to three to over dollar amounts in thousands or less to one year three years five years five years total total interest earning assets total interest bearing liabilities interest rate sensitivity gap cumulative rate sensitivity gap ratio of gap during the period to total interest earning assets ratio of cumulative gap to total interest earning assets total assets although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag behind changes in market interest rates 
in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
the ability of many borrowers to service their debt may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase 
the one year interest rate sensitivity gap has been the most common industry standard used to measure an institution s interest rate risk position regarding maturities  repricing and prepayments 
in recent years  in addition to utilizing interest rate sensitivity gap analysis  the corporation has increased its emphasis on the utilization of interest rate sensitivity simulation analysis to evaluate and manage interest rate risk 
interest rate sensitivity simulation analysis the corporation also utilizes income simulation modeling in measuring its interest rate risk and managing its interest rate sensitivity 
the finance committee of the corporation believes that simulation modeling enables the corporation to more accurately evaluate and manage the possible effects on net interest income due to the exposure to changing market interest rates  the slope of the yield curve and different loan and security prepayment and deposit decay assumptions under various interest rate scenarios 
as with gap analysis and earnings simulation modeling  assumptions about the timing and variability of cash flows are critical in net portfolio equity valuation analysis 
particularly important are the assumptions driving mortgage prepayments and the assumptions about expected attrition of the core deposit portfolios 
these assumptions are based on the corporation s historical experience and industry standards and are applied consistently across the different rate risk measures 
k the corporation has established the following guidelines for assessing interest rate risk net interest income simulation 
given a basis point parallel and gradual increase or decrease in market interest rates  net interest income may not change by more than for a one year period 
portfolio equity simulation 
portfolio equity is the net present value of the corporation s existing assets and liabilities 
given a basis point immediate and permanent increase or decrease in market interest rates  portfolio equity may not correspondingly decrease or increase by more than of stockholders equity 
these guidelines take into consideration the current interest rate environment  the corporation s financial asset and financial liability product mix and characteristics and liquidity sources among other factors 
given the current rate environment  a drop in short term market interest rates of basis points immediately or over a one year horizon would seem unlikely 
this should be considered in evaluating modeling results outlined in the table below 
the following table presents the simulated impact of a basis point or basis point upward or downward shift of market interest rates on net interest income  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this analysis was done assuming that the interest earning asset and interest bearing liability levels at december  remained constant 
the impact of the market rate movements on net interest income was developed by simulating the effects of rates changing gradually during a one year period from the december  levels for net interest income 
increase decrease bp bp bp bp net interest income increase decrease net interest income increase decrease impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements of the corporation and related notes presented herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap which require the measurement of financial condition and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  substantially all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services since such prices are affected by inflation to a larger degree than interest rates 
in the current interest rate environment  liquidity and the maturity structure of the corporation s assets and liabilities are critical to the maintenance of acceptable performance levels 
capital resources total stockholders equity increased million or to million at december  from million at december  net income of million in represented an increase in earnings of million or compared to returns on average equity and assets were and  respectively  for k the corporation has maintained a strong capital position with a capital to assets ratio of at december  in an effort to sustain this strong capital position  regular cash dividends on common stock decreased to  in from million in stockholders have taken part in the corporation s dividend reinvestment plan introduced during with of registered shareholder accounts active in the plan at december  capital adequacy is intended to enhance the corporation s ability to support growth while protecting the interest of shareholders and depositors and to ensure that capital ratios are in compliance with regulatory minimum requirements 
regulatory agencies have developed certain capital ratio requirements that are used to assist them in monitoring the safety and soundness of financial institutions 
at december   the corporation and the bank were in excess of all regulatory capital requirements 
liquidity the corporation s primary sources of funds generally have been deposits obtained through the offices of the bank  borrowings from the fhlb  and amortization and prepayments of outstanding loans and maturing securities 
during  the corporation used its sources of funds primarily to fund loan commitments 
as of december   the corporation had outstanding loan commitments  including undisbursed loans and amounts available under credit lines  totaling million  and standby letters of credit totaling  the bank is required by the occ to establish policies to monitor and manage liquidity levels to ensure the bank s ability to meet demands for customer withdrawals and the repayment of short term borrowings  and the bank is currently in compliance with all liquidity policy limits 
at december   time deposits amounted to million or of the corporation s total consolidated deposits  including approximately million  which are scheduled to mature within the next year 
management of the corporation believes that the corporation has adequate resources to fund all of its commitments  that all of its commitments will be funded as required by related maturity dates and that  based upon past experience and current pricing policies  it can adjust the rates of time deposits to retain a substantial portion of maturing liabilities 
aside from liquidity available from customer deposits or through sales and maturities of securities  the corporation has alternative sources of funds such as a line of credit and term borrowing capacity from the fhlb and  to a more limited extent  through the sale of loans 
at december   the corporation s borrowing capacity with the fhlb  net of funds borrowed  was million 
the corporation paid quarterly cash dividends over the past two years and determined to reduce the quarterly cash dividend from per common share to per common share effective for the second quarter of the corporation paid dividends of per common share for the four quarter of on february  the corporation declared dividends of per common share payable on march  to shareholders of record on march  the determination of future dividends on the corporation s common stock will depend on conditions existing at that time with consideration given to the corporation s earnings  capital and liquidity needs  among other factors 
management is not aware of any conditions  including any regulatory recommendations or requirements  that would adversely impact its liquidity or its ability to meet funding needs in the ordinary course of business 
k critical accounting policies the corporation s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap and follow general practices within the industry in which it operates 
application of these principles requires management to make estimates or judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates or judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
estimates or judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value  when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write down or valuation reserve to be established or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by third party sources  when available 
when third party information is not available  valuation adjustments are estimated in good faith by management primarily though the use of internal cash flow modeling techniques 
the most significant accounting policies followed by the corporation are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
management views critical accounting policies to be those which are highly dependent on subjective or complex judgments  estimates and assumptions and where changes in those estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on the financial statements 
management has identified the following as critical accounting policies 
allowance for loan losses 
the corporation considers that the determination of the allowance for loan losses involves a higher degree of judgment and complexity than its other significant accounting policies 
the balance in the allowance for loan losses is determined based on management s review and evaluation of the loan portfolio in relation to past loss experience  the size and composition of the portfolio  current economic events and conditions and other pertinent factors  including management s assumptions as to future delinquencies  recoveries and losses 
all of these factors may be susceptible to significant change 
among the many factors affecting the allowance for loan losses  some are quantitative while others require qualitative judgment 
although management believes its process for determining the allowance adequately considers all of the potential factors that could potentially result in credit losses  the process includes subjective elements and may be susceptible to significant change 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from management s estimates  additional provisions for loan losses may be required that would adversely impact the corporation s financial condition or earnings in future periods 
other than temporary impairment 
management evaluates securities for other than temporary impairment at least on a quarterly basis  and more frequently when economic  market or other concerns warrant such evaluation 
consideration is given to the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  whether the market decline was affected by macroeconomic conditions and whether the corporation has the intent to sell the debt security or more likely than not will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery 
k goodwill and intangible assets 
goodwill represents the excess cost over fair value of assets acquired in a business combination 
goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually 
intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values 
the impairment test is a two step process that begins with an initial impairment evaluation 
if the initial evaluation suggests that an impairment of the asset value exists  the second step is to determine the amount of the impairment 
if the tests conclude that goodwill is impaired  the carrying value is adjusted and an impairment charge is recorded 
as of december   the required annual impairment test of goodwill was performed and management concluded that no impairment existed as of that date
