during  we renewed approximately  hlc subscribers  representing a renewal rate for the subscribers up for renewal  and a renewal rate based on the annual contract value up for renewal 
as of december  our cash and investment balances approximated million  and we maintained full availability under our million revolving credit facility 
critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition we recognize revenues from our internet based learning products and courseware subscriptions based on a per person subscription basis  and in some cases on a per license basis 
our fees are based on the size of the facilities or organizations employee user population and the service offerings to which they subscribe 
revenue is recognized ratably over the service period of the underlying contract 
revenues associated with online training are recognized over the term of the subscription period or over the historical usage period  if usage typically differs from the subscription period 
all other service revenues are recognized as the related services are performed or products are delivered 
revenues from survey and research services are recognized when survey results are delivered to customers via either internet based reporting throughout the survey period or by providing final survey results once all services are complete 
a significant portion of revenues for survey and reporting services that are provided through the use of internet based reporting methodologies are recognized using the proportional performance method  reflecting recognition throughout the service period which corresponds with the survey cycle and reporting access by the customer  which typically ranges from one to five months 
if survey results are delivered to the customer after all services have been completed  then the corresponding revenues are recognized in full in the period such results are provided to the customer 
all other revenues are recognized as the related services are performed or products are delivered to the customer 
revenues for these services can be subject to seasonal factors based on customers requirements that can impact the timing  frequency  and volume of survey cycles 
revenues from professional services include content maintenance  consulting  and implementation services 
fees are based on the time and efforts involved  and revenue is recognized upon completion of performance milestones using the proportional performance method 
we offer training services for clients to facilitate integration of our internet based products 
fees for training are based on the time and efforts of the personnel involved 
basic online training is generally included in the initial contract  however  incremental training is fee based and revenues are generally recognized upon completion of training services 

table of contents revenues from content maintenance and development services are recognized using a percentage of completion method based on labor hours  which correspond to the completion of performance milestones and deliverables 
sales of products and services to pharmaceutical and medical device companies can be subject to seasonal factors as a result of meeting and conference dates for such companies 
we expect to continue to generate revenues by marketing our internet based products and our survey and research services through healthcare organizations and to a lesser extent  through pharmaceutical and medical device companies 
we expect that the portion of our revenues related to services provided via our internet based learning products will increase in absolute dollar amounts 
specifically  we will seek to generate revenues from healthcare workers by marketing to their employers or sponsoring organizations 
the fees we charge for courseware resulting from this marketing is typically paid by either the employer or sponsoring organization 
accounting for income taxes the company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities measured at tax rates that will be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
the company has significant net operating loss carryforwards nols which management believes will be available to reduce future tax expense 
these nols are subject to annual limitations under the internal revenue code section  which could result in the expiration of certain portions of the company s nols before they are fully utilized 
management periodically assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets  and to the extent that we believe a recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount we estimate will be recoverable 
at december   management concluded that it was more likely than not that substantially all of the remaining deferred tax assets will be realized in future periods  and released approximately million from the valuation allowance 
the company continues to maintain a valuation allowance of approximately million for the remaining portion of its deferred tax assets  which are related to the portion of our nols associated with deductions for stock option exercises 
product development costs product development includes our costs to develop and maintain our products and applications  including our internet based learning products and our survey reporting application 
once planning is completed and development begins  we capitalize internal costs and payments to third parties associated with the development efforts where the life expectancy is greater than one year and the anticipated cash flows are expected to exceed the cost of the related asset 
during and  we capitalized approximately  and  respectively  related to development of content  primarily by third parties 
such amounts are included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets under the caption prepaid development fees and other assets 
during and  we capitalized approximately million and million  respectively  for the development of various software feature enhancements 
such amounts are included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets under the caption capitalized software feature enhancements 
a significant portion of these capitalized costs was associated with our competency assessment product and additional features for our internet based hlc platform 
we amortize content and software feature enhancements over their expected life  which is generally one to four years 
capitalized content and software feature enhancements are subject to a periodic impairment review in accordance with our impairment review policy 
in connection with product development  our significant estimates involve the assessment of the development period for new products  as well as the expected useful life of costs associated with new products  software feature enhancements and content 
once capitalized  software feature enhancements and content development costs are subject to the policies and estimates described below regarding goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets 
product development costs also include our systems team  which manages our efforts associated with product development and maintenance  database management  quality assurance and security 
this team is responsible for new internal product development  integration of external new products  and continued enhancements and regularly scheduled maintenance to our learning and research platform products 
personnel who are responsible for our overall product portfolio as well as prioritization of new product development are also included in product development costs 
goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets we measure goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level using both income and market based models to determine the fair value of the reporting units 
our models contain significant assumptions and accounting estimates about discount rates  future cash flows and terminal values that could materially affect our operating results or financial position if they were to change significantly in the future and could result in an impairment 
we perform our goodwill impairment test whenever events or changes in facts or circumstances indicate that impairment may exist and also during the fourth quarter each year 
intangible assets and other long lived assets are also reviewed for events or changes in facts and circumstances  both internally and externally  which may indicate an impairment is present 
we measure any impairment using observable market values or discounted future cash flows from the related long lived assets 
the cash flow estimates and discount rates incorporate management s best estimates  using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the date of evaluation 
allowance for doubtful accounts we estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts using both a specific and non specific identification method 
management s evaluation includes reviewing past due accounts on a case by case basis  and determining whether an account should be reserved  based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each potentially uncollectible account 
an allowance is also maintained for accounts not specifically 
table of contents identified that may become uncollectible in the future 
uncollectible accounts are written off in the period management believes it has exhausted every opportunity to collect payment from the customer 
bad debt expense is recorded when events or circumstances indicate an additional allowance is necessary based on our specific and non specific identification approach 
our allowance for doubtful accounts totaled approximately  as of december  accrual for service credits due to the complexity of our hosted applications  variability in customer utilization patterns  changes in technology  and potential software defects  our hosted learning management applications could experience periodic downtime 
in addition  we have specific contractual obligations that can result in penalties to us associated with system performance and other commitments 
we maintain an accrual which is intended to provide for concessions due to customers experiencing inconveniences or operation disruption resulting from downtime or performance of our applications  or our failure to meet certain contractual obligations to customers 
our accrual for service credits totaled approximately  as of december  stock based compensation we recognize compensation expense using a fair value based method for costs related to share based payments including stock options 
measurement of such compensation expense requires significant estimation and assumptions  however  we believe that the black scholes option pricing model we use for calculating the fair value of our stock based compensation plans provides a reasonable measurement methodology using a framework that is widely adopted 
as of december   we had a stock incentive plan which qualified as a stock based compensation plan 
during the years ended december    and  we recorded approximately   and  of stock based compensation expense  respectively 
we typically grant stock options to our management group on an annual basis  or when new members of the management group begin their employment 
we grant stock options to members of our board of directors in conjunction with our annual shareholders meeting  or as new members are added on a pro rata basis based on the time elapsed since our annual shareholders meeting 
we expect to continue this practice for the foreseeable future  however  we may adjust the size of the annual grant 
as of december   total future compensation cost related to non vested awards not yet recognized was  net of estimated forfeitures  with a weighted average expense recognition period of years 
future compensation expense recognition for new option grants will vary depending on the timing and size of new awards granted  changes in the market price or volatility of our common stock  changes in risk free interest rates  or if actual forfeitures vary significantly from our estimates 
nonmonetary exchange of content rights and deferred service credits during  we recorded content rights and deferred service credits of approximately  in connection with a nonmonetary exchange with one of our customers 
in order to account for this transaction  we estimated the fair value of the related assets and service credits  assessed whether the value assigned to the content was recoverable  and amortized the related assets over their estimated useful lives 
our future operating results will be impacted by the customer s utilization of the service credits 
revenues for services provided in exchange for service credits will be recognized in accordance with our revenue recognition policies

our reconciliation of this calculation to measures under us gaap is listed in the table below 
in order to better assess the company s financial results  management believes that adjusted ebitda is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of the company at this stage in its life cycle because adjusted ebitda reflects net income adjusted for non cash and non operating items 
adjusted ebitda is also used by many investors and securities analysts to assess the company s results from current operations 
adjusted ebitda is a non gaap financial measure and should not be considered as a measure of financial performance under us gaap 
because adjusted ebitda is not a measurement determined in accordance with us gaap  it is susceptible to varying calculations 
accordingly  adjusted ebitda  as presented  may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
the company understands that  although adjusted ebitda is frequently used by investors and securities analysts in their evaluation of companies  this measure has limitations as an analytical tool  and you should not consider it in isolation  or as a substitute for an analysis of the company s results as reported under us gaap 
for example  adjusted ebitda does not reflect cash expenditures  or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  it does not reflect non cash components of employee compensation  it does not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  and due to the company s utilization of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards in and  actual cash income tax payments have been significantly less than the tax provision 
table of contents recorded in accordance with us gaap  and income tax payments will continue to be less than the income tax provision until our existing federal and state net operating loss carryforwards have been fully utilized or have expired 
management compensates for the inherent limitations associated with using adjusted ebitda through disclosure of such limitations  presentation of our financial statements in accordance with us gaap  and a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income  the most directly comparable us gaap measure
