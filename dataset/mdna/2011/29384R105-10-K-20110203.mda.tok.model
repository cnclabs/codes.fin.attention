overview entropic communications is a leading fabless semiconductor company that designs  develops and markets systems solutions to enable connected home entertainment 
our technologies significantly change the way high definition television quality video  or hd video  standard definition television quality video  or sd video  and other multimedia content such as movies  music  games and photos are brought into and delivered throughout the home 
we are a pioneer of key technologies that enable connected home networking of digital entertainment over existing coaxial cable 
we are a founding member of multimedia over coax alliance  or moca  a global home networking consortium that sets standards for the distribution of video and other multimedia entertainment over coaxial cable 
our products include integrated circuits and related software associated with home networking solutions based on the moca standard  direct broadcast satellite  or dbs  services  high speed broadband access  and silicon tuners 
our products allow telecommunications carriers  cable operators and dbs service providers  which we collectively refer to as service providers  as well as providers of over the top  or ott  services  to enhance and expand their service offerings and reduce deployment costs in an increasingly competitive environment 
our moca home networking solutions are now being deployed into consumer homes to support multi room digital video recorder  or dvr  service by comcast  cox  directv  time warner cable and verizon  as well as by a number of smaller service providers 
in december  we introduced and commenced commercial shipments of our home networking products 
in the first quarter of  we began commercially shipping our broadband access solutions 
in may  we acquired arabella software ltd  or arabella  a developer of embedded software 
in june  we acquired rf magic  a provider of digital broadcast satellite outdoor unit and silicon tuner solutions 
in  we acquired certain specified assets of vativ technologies  inc  or vativ  a provider of high bandwidth  advanced digital processing solutions for digital television and gigabit ethernet markets 
since inception  we have invested heavily in product development and have only recently achieved profitability on an annual basis  with a net income of million for the year ended december  in  our net revenues increased to million from million in which was primarily due to the increased demand for our home networking products and our dbs products  which is directly related to the increased deployment of our products into consumer homes by satellite and cable operators 
our net revenues decreased from million in to million in  driven primarily by softness in demand for our home networking products and  to a lesser extent  by lower demand for our dbs products 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 

table of contents we generate the majority of our revenues from sales of our products to original design manufacturers  or odms  and original equipment manufacturers  or oems  that provide customer premises equipment to service providers 
we price our products based on market and competitive conditions and reduce the price of our products over time  as market and competitive conditions change  and as manufacturing costs are reduced 
our markets are generally characterized by declining average selling prices over the life of a product and  accordingly  we must reduce costs and successfully introduce new products and enhancements to maintain our gross margins 
we rely on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our net revenues 
sales to these customers are in turn driven by service providers that purchase our customers products which incorporate our products 
a substantial percentage of our net revenues are dependent upon five major service providers comcast  directv  dish network  time warner cable and verizon 
in addition  we are dependent on sales outside of the united states for almost all of our net revenues and expect that to continue in the future 
we use third party foundries and assembly and test contractors to manufacture  assemble and test our products 
this outsourced manufacturing approach allows us to focus our resources on the design  sales and marketing of our products and avoid the cost associated with owning and operating our own manufacturing facility 
a significant portion of our cost of net revenues consists of payments for the purchase of wafers and for manufacturing  assembly and test services 
we expect research and development expenses in future years to continue to increase in total dollars as we develop additional products and expand our business  and to fluctuate over the course of the year based on the timing of our development tools and supply costs  which include outside services  masks costs and software licenses 
we also anticipate that our sales and marketing expenses will increase as we expand our domestic and international sales and marketing organization and activities and build brand awareness 
due to the lengthy sales cycles that we face  we may experience significant delays from the time we incur research and development and sales and marketing expenses until the time  if ever  that we generate sales from the related products 
since our inception  we have funded our operations using a combination of preferred stock issuances  cash collections from customers  bank credit facilities  cash received from the exercise of stock options and proceeds from public offerings of our common stock 
for example  on october   we completed a public offering of  shares of our common stock  which resulted in net proceeds of approximately million 
we intend to continue spending substantial amounts in connection with the growth of our business to pursue our business strategy  develop new products  respond to competition and market opportunities  and possibly acquire complementary businesses or technologies 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the dates of the consolidated financial statements  the disclosure of contingencies as of the dates of the consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
although we believe that our judgments and estimates are reasonable under the circumstances  actual results may differ from those estimates 
if actual results or events differ materially from those contemplated by us in making these estimates  our reported financial condition and results of operations for future periods could be materially affected 

table of contents we believe the following to be our critical accounting policies because they are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and they require critical management judgments and estimates about matters that are uncertain revenue recognition  warranty accrual  inventory valuation  stock based compensation  accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets  and accounting for income taxes 
revenue recognition our net revenues are generated principally by sales of our semiconductor products 
during the years ended december   and  product net revenues represented more than of our total net revenues 
our sales primarily occur through the efforts of our direct sales force 
the remainder of our sales occurs through third party sales representatives and distributors 
during the years ended december   and  more than of our sales occurred through the efforts of our direct sales force 
we recognize product revenues when the following fundamental criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  iii the price to the customer is fixed or determinable  and iv collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
these criteria are usually met at the time of product shipment  however  we do not recognize revenue until all substantive customer acceptance requirements have been met  when applicable 
a portion of our sales is made through distributors  agents or customers acting as agents under agreements allowing for pricing credits and or rights of return 
product net revenues on sales made through these distributors are not recognized until the distributors ship the product to their customers 
revenues derived from billing customers for shipping and handling costs are classified as a component of net revenues 
costs of shipping and handling charged by suppliers are classified as a component of cost of net revenues 
we record reductions to net revenues for estimated product returns and pricing adjustments  such as competitive pricing programs  in the same period that the related revenue is recorded 
the amount of these reductions is based on historical sales returns and other factors known at the time 
if actual returns differ significantly from our estimates  such differences would be recorded in our results of operations for the period in which the actual returns become known 
to date  changes in estimated returns have not been material to net revenues in any related period 
we are party to an inventory hubbing agreement with motorola 
pursuant to this agreement  we deliver products to the designated third party warehouse based upon motorola s projected needs  but do not recognize product revenue unless and until motorola removes our products from the third party warehouse to incorporate into its own products 

table of contents we receive royalties in exchange for an exclusive right to manufacture and sell certain products 
we have determined that we are not able to reliably estimate the royalties earned in the period the sales occur and  as a result  we record net revenues based on cash receipts 
the royalty revenues recorded during the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively  and are included in net revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
we have entered into agreements to license certain hardware and software  also referred to as the nodes  to certain members of moca for a period of three years and to provide upgrades when and if they become available 
the agreements limit the rights to use the nodes to test compliance of the members own products to the moca specification 
for these arrangements  we defer all of the license revenues when the nodes are delivered and recognize the revenues on a straight line basis over the three year term of the agreement 
we provide rebates on our products to certain customers 
at the time of the sale  we accrue of the potential rebate as a reduction to net revenue and do not apply a breakage factor 
the amount of these reductions is based upon the terms included in various rebate agreements 
we reverse the accrual for unclaimed rebate amounts as specific rebate programs contractually end or when we believe unclaimed rebates are no longer subject to payment and will not be paid 
for the years ended december   and  we reduced net revenue by million  million and million  respectively  in connection with our rebate programs 
we occasionally enter into agreements where revenue is derived from multiple deliverables including any mix of products and or services 
these products and or services are generally delivered from approximately three months to two years after the execution date 
revenue recognition for agreements with multiple deliverables is based on the individual units of accounting determined to exist in the agreement 
a delivered item is considered a separate unit of accounting when the delivered item has value to the customer on a stand alone basis 
items are considered to have stand alone value when they are sold separately by any vendor or when the customer could resell the item on a stand alone basis 
for multiple deliverable agreements entered into after december   consideration is allocated at the inception of the agreement to all deliverables based on their relative selling price 
the relative selling price for each deliverable is determined using vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of selling price or third party evidence of selling price if vsoe does not exist 
if neither vsoe nor third party evidence of selling price exists  we use our best estimate of the selling price for the deliverable 
to date  multiple deliverable contracts have not been material to net revenues in any related period and our adoption of the new accounting guidance for determining multiple element arrangements effective january  did not have an impact on our operating results 
for multiple deliverable agreements entered into on or prior to december   consideration was generally allocated to each unit of accounting based upon its relative fair value when objective and reliable evidence of fair value existed for all units of accounting in the agreement 
the fair value of an item was generally the price charged for the product  if the item was regularly sold on a stand alone basis 
in order to establish vsoe of selling price  we must regularly sell the product and or service on a standalone basis with a substantial majority priced within a relatively narrow range 
vsoe of selling price is usually the midpoint of that range 
if there is not a sufficient number of standalone sales and vsoe of selling price cannot be determined  then we consider whether third party evidence can be used to establish the selling price 
if neither vsoe nor third party evidence of selling price exists  effective january  we determine our best estimate of selling price using average selling prices 
table of contents over a rolling month period as well as market conditions 
if the product or service has no history of sales  we rely upon sales prices set by our pricing committee  adjusted for applicable discounts 
we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when we determine there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance 
changes in the allocation of the sales price between delivered and undelivered elements can impact the revenue recognition but do not change the total revenue recognized on any agreement 
warranty accrual we generally provide a warranty on our products for a period of one year  however  it may be longer for certain customers 
accordingly  we establish provisions for estimated product warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized based upon our historical activity and  additionally  for any known product warranty issues 
warranty provisions are recorded as a cost of net revenues 
the determination of such provisions requires us to make estimates of product return rates and expected costs to replace or rework the products under warranty 
when the actual product failure rates  cost of replacements and rework costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty accrual are made 
actual claims are charged against the warranty reserve 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
lower of cost or market adjustments reduce the carrying value of the related inventory and take into consideration reductions in sales prices  excess inventory levels and obsolete inventory 
these adjustments are calculated on a part by part basis and  in general  represent excess inventory value on hand compared to month demand projections 
once established  these adjustments are considered permanent and are not reversed until the related inventory is sold or disposed 
we have entered into a capacity agreement with one of our third party foundry contractors in order to guarantee minimum capacity volumes on our digital outdoor unit and silicon tuner products 
pursuant to the capacity agreement  we have made prepayments which will result in reduced prices paid on future inventory purchases up to a specified volume 
the prepayments are being amortized into the cost of our inventory purchases based on the specified volume commitments under the terms of the capacity agreement 
the prepaid inventory volume commitments are assessed for impairment on a periodic basis by comparing the remaining prepaid balance to our estimate of remaining purchases 
there have been no impairments to date 
stock based compensation we have equity incentive plans under which incentive stock options have been granted to employees and restricted stock units and non qualified stock options have been granted to employees and non employees 
we also have an employee stock purchase plan for all eligible employees 
our stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the estimated fair value of the award  and is recognized as an expense over the employee s requisite service period 
we have no stock based compensation awards with market or performance conditions 
the stock based compensation expense attributable to awards under our employee stock purchase plan  or espp  was determined using the black scholes option pricing model 
we also grant awards to non employees and determine the fair value of such stock based compensation awards granted as either the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of 
table of contents the equity instruments issued  whichever is more reliably measurable 
if the fair value of the equity instruments issued is used  it is measured using the stock price and other measurement assumptions as of the earlier of i the date at which a commitment for performance by the counterparty to earn the equity instruments is reached  or ii the date at which the counterparty s performance is completed 
we recognize excess tax benefits associated with stock based compensation to stockholders equity only when realized 
when assessing whether excess tax benefits relating to stock based compensation have been realized  we follow the with and without approach excluding any indirect effects to be realized until after the utilization of all other tax benefits available to us 
goodwill and intangible assets we record goodwill and other intangible assets based on the fair value of the assets acquired 
in determining the fair value of the assets acquired  we utilize extensive accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
we use the discounted cash flow method to estimate the value of intangible assets acquired 
the estimates used to value and amortize intangible assets are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business and are based on available historical information and industry estimates and averages 
we assess goodwill and certain intangible assets for impairment using fair value measurement techniques on an annual basis  during the fourth quarter of the year or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist 
we perform an interim goodwill impairment test when it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount 
we operate as one reporting unit 
the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as in a business combination 
determining the fair value of the implied goodwill is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge 
estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and market comparisons 
these approaches use significant estimates and assumptions  including the size and timing of deployments by our customers and related projections and timing of future cash flows  discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows  perpetual growth rates  stage of products in development  determination of appropriate market comparables  and determination of whether a premium or discount should be applied to comparables 
accounting for income taxes we estimate income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision 
we estimate the current tax liability and assess temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are reflected in our balance sheets 
we then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized 
a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
when a valuation allowance is established or increased  we record a corresponding tax expense in our statements of operations 
we review the need for a valuation allowance each interim period to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize deferred tax assets before they expire 
the valuation allowance analysis is based on estimates of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the periods over which our deferred tax assets will be realizable 

table of contents we recognize and measure benefits for uncertain tax positions using a two step approach 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon audit  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes 
for tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit  the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that has more than a chance of being realized upon settlement 
significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions 
we evaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
the evaluations are based upon a number of factors  including changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
during the fourth quarter of  we concluded that it was more likely than not that we would be able to realize the benefit of our federal deferred tax assets in the future 
we based this conclusion on historical and projected operating performance  as well as our expectation that our operations will generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to realize the tax benefits associated with the deferred tax assets 
as a result  we reduced the valuation allowance on a portion of our net deferred tax assets by million at december  we will continue to assess the need for a valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset by evaluating both positive and negative evidence that may exist 
any adjustment to the net deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be recorded in the income statement for the period that the adjustment is determined to be required 
segment reporting we are organized as  and operate in  one reportable segment the design  development and sale of silicon integrated circuits 
products within this segment are embedded in electronic devices used to enable the delivery of multiple streams of hd video and other multimedia content for entertainment purposes into and throughout the home 
our chief operating decision maker is our chief executive officer  or ceo 
our ceo reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for the purpose of evaluating financial performance and allocating resources 
there are no segment managers who are held accountable for operations below the consolidated financial statement level 
our assets are primarily located in the united states and not allocated to any specific region 
therefore  geographic information is presented only for total revenue 
recently issued accounting standards in october  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued authoritative guidance for arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the guidance will allow companies to allocate arrangement consideration in multiple deliverable arrangements in a manner that is intended to better reflect the transaction s economics 
the guidance also removes non software components of tangible products and certain software components of tangible products from the scope of existing software revenue guidance 
the new guidance requires expanded qualitative and quantitative disclosures and is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june  early adoption of the guidance is permitted 
we have adopted this guidance effective january  and the application of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in march  the fasb ratified the milestone method of revenue recognition 
under this new standard  an entity can recognize contingent consideration earned from the achievement of a substantive milestone in its entirety in the period in which the milestone is achieved 
a milestone is 
table of contents defined as an event i that can only be achieved based in whole or in part on either the entity s performance or on the occurrence of a specific outcome resulting from the entity s performance  ii for which there is substantive uncertainty at the date the arrangement is entered into that the event will be achieved  and iii that would result in additional payments being due to the entity 
the milestone method of revenue recognition is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june  and may be applied prospectively after the adoption date or retrospectively for all periods presented 
the impact of adoption on our consolidated financial statements will ultimately depend on the terms of any future business transactions

we generate net revenues principally by sales of our semiconductor products 
we also generate service revenues from development contracts 
we principally sell our products directly to either odms or oems 
we price our products based on market and competitive conditions  and periodically reduce the price of our products as market and competitive conditions change and as manufacturing costs are reduced 
our markets are generally characterized by declining average selling prices over the life of a product and  accordingly  we must reduce costs and successfully introduce new products and enhancements to maintain our gross margins 
we currently rely  and expect to continue to rely  on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our net revenues 
for the years ended december   and  four customers accounted for  and of our net revenues  respectively 
in addition  we depend on a limited number of service providers that purchase products from our customers that incorporate our products 
to date  only a limited number of major service providers  such as verizon  directv  time warner cable  cox  comcast and bright house networks llc have publicly announced their intention to use the moca standard for home networking 
we also primarily rely on two major service providers  dish network and directv  to deploy products using our dbs outdoor unit solutions 
during the year ended december   products sold to our customers that were incorporated into products purchased by verizon  dish network and directv accounted for 
table of contents substantially all of our net revenues 
however  during the year ended december   in addition to verizon  dish network and directv  we also generated meaningful revenues from the sale of our products to our customers that were incorporated into products purchased by comcast  time warner cable and cox 
to date  the fios deployment by verizon and the directv multi room dvr and swim dish deployments have been major drivers of our net revenues 
we expect that we will continue to derive significant revenues from verizon and directv  but our reliance on verizon and directv as the major driver of our net revenues is decreasing as other service providers  such as time warner cable  comcast and cox deploy our home networking products 
since inception  we have derived our net revenues primarily from asia  the united states and other north american countries 
net revenues are allocated to the geographic region based on the shipping destination of customer orders 
for sales to odms and oems  their geographic locations may differ from those of the ultimate end customers

of our million in net revenues in  million  million and million were derived from asia  north america and europe  respectively 
of our million in net revenues in  million  million and million were derived from asia  europe and north america  respectively 
accordingly  we are dependent on sales outside of the united states for most of our net revenues and expect that to continue in the future 
cost of net revenues 
we use third party foundries and assembly and test contractors to manufacture  assemble and test our products 
a significant portion of our cost of net revenues consists of payments for the purchase of wafers and for manufacturing  assembly and test services 
to a lesser extent  cost of net revenues includes expenses relating to management of our contractors  the cost of shipping and logistics  royalties  inventory valuation charges taken for excess and obsolete inventory  warranty costs  changes in product cost due to changes in wafer manufacturing  assembly and test yields  allocated facilities expenses  amortization of inventory step up and acquired developed technology 
we currently outsource the manufacturing of our home networking and broadband access products principally to tsmc  and the manufacturing of our digital broadcast satellite outdoor unit and silicon tuner products to towerjazz 
our home networking and broadband access products are primarily assembled and tested by amkor  while our digital broadcast satellite outdoor unit and silicon tuner products are primarily assembled by amkor and tested by giga solution 
in september  we entered into a capacity commitment agreement with towerjazz in order to guarantee minimum capacity volumes on our digital broadcast satellite outdoor unit and silicon tuner products through december  gross margin 
our gross margins have increased each year from to  primarily due to decreased unit costs of our home networking chipsets principally as a result of more favorable manufacturing costs and the increase in the revenues generated from our digital broadcast satellite outdoor products  which carry a higher gross margin as compared to our home networking products 
included in cost of net revenues for the years ended december   and was the amortization of developed technology of million  million and million  respectively  which resulted from our rf magic and vativ acquisitions 
our gross margin has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors  including declines in selling prices of our products  especially as competition increases over time  product mix  the timing of cost reductions for fabricated wafers and assembly and test service costs  inventory valuation charges  purchase accounting related charges  and changes in wafer manufacturing  assembly and test yields 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses primarily include costs related to personnel  third party services that consist primarily of contract labor services  fabrication masks  architecture licenses  engineering design development software and hardware 
table of contents tools  allocated facilities expenses and depreciation of equipment used in research and development 
while a substantial portion of our research and development activities are undertaken in support of our current and anticipated customers  we also invest in research and development to develop our technology 
in the future  we expect some of the services currently performed by contractors to be performed internally 
we expect research and development expenses in future years to continue to increase in total dollars 
we anticipate that our research and development expenses may fluctuate over the course of a year based on the timing of our development tools and supply costs  which include third party services  masks costs and licenses 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses primarily include costs related to personnel  sales commissions  trade shows  marketing programs  depreciation and allocated facilities expenses 
we plan to continue to increase the size of our sales and marketing organization to enable us to expand into existing and new markets 
we also plan to continue to invest in expanding our domestic and international sales and marketing activities and build brand awareness 
due to the lengthy sales cycles that we face  we may experience significant delays from the time we incur research and development and sales expenses until the time  if ever  that we generate sales from these products 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses primarily include costs related to personnel  accounting and tax  legal compliance and allocated support expenses 
we expect that in future years our general and administrative expenses will increase as we incur additional costs associated with supporting our business growth

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk our sales have been historically denominated in us dollars and an increase in the value of us dollar relative to the currencies of the countries in which our customers operate could materially affect the demand of our products by non us customers  leading to a reduction in orders placed by these customers  which would adversely affect our business 
our international sales and marketing operations incur expenses that are denominated in foreign currencies 
these expenses could be materially affected by currency fluctuations  however  we do not consider this currency risk to be material as the related costs do not constitute a significant portion of our total spending 
we outsource our wafer manufacturing  assembly  testing  warehousing and shipping operations  however all expenses related thereto are denominated in us dollars 
if the value of the us dollar decreases relative to the currencies of the countries in which such contractors operate  the prices we are charged for their services may increase  which would adversely affect our business 
currently  we have not implemented any hedging strategies to mitigate risks related to the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk we typically maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings  types and maturities 
we do not use derivative financial instruments 
we place our cash investments in deposits and money market funds with major financial institutions  us government obligations and debt securities of corporations with strong credit ratings in a variety of industries that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
these guidelines also limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer or type of instrument 
all of our fixed income investments are classified as available for sale and therefore reported on the balance sheet at market value 
the fair value of our cash equivalents and investments are subject to change as a result of changes in market interest rates and investment risk related to the issuers credit worthiness 
we do not utilize financial contracts to manage our exposure in our investment portfolio to changes in interest rates 
we place our cash investments in instruments that meet credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
we have established guidelines 
table of contents relative to diversification and maturities that attempt to maintain safety and liquidity 
these guidelines are periodically reviewed and modified to take advantage of interest rate trends 
we generally do not utilize derivatives to hedge against increases in interest rates which decrease market values 
at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and investments  all of which are stated at fair value 
a basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates over a three month period would not be expected to have a material impact on the fair value of the million of cash and cash equivalents held as of december   as these consisted of securities with maturities of less than three months 
a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would  however  decrease or increase  respectively  the fair value of the million of our investments by approximately million
