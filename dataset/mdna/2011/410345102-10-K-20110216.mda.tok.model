overview our company we are a consumer goods company with a portfolio of leading apparel brands  including hanes  champion  playtex  bali  l eggs  just my size  barely there  wonderbra  stedman  outer banks  zorba  rinbros  duofold and gear for sports 
we design  manufacture  source and sell a broad range of basic apparel such as t shirts  bras  panties  men s underwear  kids underwear  casualwear  activewear  socks and hosiery 
according to npd  our brands held either the number one or number two us market position by units sold in most product categories in which we compete  for the month period ended december  our distribution channels include direct to consumer sales at our outlet stores  national chains and department stores and warehouse clubs  mass merchandise outlets and international sales

table of contents our segments our operations are managed and reported in five operating segments  each of which is a reportable segment for financial reporting purposes innerwear  outerwear  hosiery  direct to consumer and international 
these segments are organized principally by product category  geographic location and distribution channel 
each segment has its own management that is responsible for the operations of the segment s businesses but the segments share a common supply chain and media and marketing platforms 
in october  we completed the sale of our yarn operations and  as a result  we no longer have net sales in the other segment  which was primarily comprised of sales of yarn to third parties 
innerwear 
the innerwear segment focuses on core basic apparel  and consists of products such as women s intimate apparel  men s underwear  kids underwear  and socks  marketed under well known brands that are trusted by consumers 
we are an intimate apparel category leader in the united states with our hanes  playtex  bali  barely there  just my size and wonderbra brands

on november   we completed our acquisition of gear for sports  a leading seller of licensed logo apparel in collegiate bookstores and other channels  which significantly strengthens our strategy of creating stronger branded and defensible businesses in our outerwear segment 
the operating results of gear for sports are included in the outerwear segment 
during  net sales from our outerwear segment were billion  representing approximately of total net sales

we are the leading marketer of women s sheer hosiery in the united states 
we compete in the hosiery market by striving to offer superior values and executing integrated marketing activities  as well as focusing on the style of our hosiery products 
we market hosiery products under our l eggs  hanes and just my size brands 
during  net sales from our hosiery segment were million  representing approximately of total net sales 
we expect the trend of declining hosiery sales to continue consistent with the overall decline in the industry and with shifts in consumer preferences 
direct to consumer 
our direct to consumer operations include our value based outlet stores and internet operations which sell products from our portfolio of leading brands 
we sell our branded products directly to consumers through our outlet stores as well as our websites operating under the hanes  one hanes place  just my size and champion names

during  net sales from our international segment were million  representing approximately of total net sales and included sales in latin america  asia  canada  europe and south america 
our largest international markets are canada  japan  mexico  europe and brazil  and we also have sales offices in india and china 

table of contents outlook for after a strong performance in in an uncertain and volatile economic environment  we expect continued double digit growth in with projected net sales of approximately billion to billion compared to billion in the primary drivers of this growth are expected to be price increases  partially offset by demand elasticity  a full year of the gear for sports acquisition contributing approximately five points of growth  and net shelf space gains and increases in consumer spending each contributing another one to two points of growth in net sales 
because of expected systemic cost inflation in as described below  particularly for cotton  energy and labor  we expect to take price increases throughout the year as warranted by cost inflation  including multiple increases already put in place through late summer 
the timing and frequency of price increases will vary by product category  channel of trade  and country  with some increases as frequently as quarterly 
the magnitude of price increases also will vary by product category 
demand elasticity effects  which could be significant for higher double digit price increases implemented later in  should be manageable and will have a muted impact in for the first three quarters of  we believe we know the majority of our costs  with cotton prices locked in through october 
our current earnings expectations assume we will continue to realize efficiency savings from our supply chain optimization of approximately million and eliminate the majority of excess costs to service the strong sales growth of to million  continued investment in trade and media spending consistent with our historical rate of to million  stable interest expense  and a higher full year tax rate that could range from a percentage in the teens to the low s 
as a result of the cost inflation and higher product pricing  we expect higher working capital  in particular higher accounts receivable and inventories  partially offset by higher inventory turns which will negatively impact our cash flow 
we typically use cash for the first half of the year and generate most of our cash flow in the second half of the year 
business and industry trends inflation and changing prices the economic environment in which we are operating continues to be uncertain and volatile  which could have unanticipated adverse effects on our business during and beyond 
we are seeing a sustained increase in various input costs  such as cotton and oil related materials  utilities  freight and wages  which impacted our results in and will continue to do so throughout the estimated impact of cost inflation could be in the range of to million higher in over rising demand for cotton resulting from the economic recovery  weather related supply disruptions  significant declines in us inventory and a sharp rise in the futures market for cotton caused cotton prices to surge upward during and early after taking into consideration the cotton costs currently in our finished goods inventory and cotton prices we have locked in through october  we expect an average for cotton of at least per pound in for purchases of cotton used in goods manufactured by us  which would have a negative impact of ranging from to million when compared to the first and second quarters of should reflect an average cost of cents per pound  the third quarter of should reflect an average cost of cents per pound and the fourth quarter is not locked in at this time 
these estimates do not include the cotton impact on the cost of sourced goods 
although we have sold our yarn operations and nearly of our business  such as bras  sheer hosiery and portions of our activewear categories  is not cotton based  we are still exposed to fluctuations in the cost of cotton 
during  cotton prices hit their highest levels in years 
increases in the cost of cotton can result in higher costs in the price we pay for yarn from our large scale yarn suppliers 
our costs for cotton yarn and cotton based textiles vary based upon the fluctuating cost of cotton  which is affected by  among other factors  weather  consumer demand  speculation on the commodities market  the relative valuations and fluctuations of the currencies of producer versus consumer countries and other factors that are generally unpredictable and beyond our control 
we are able to lock in the cost of cotton reflected in the price we pay for yarn from our primary yarn suppliers in an attempt to protect our business from the volatility of the market price of cotton 
however  our business can be affected by dramatic movements in cotton prices 
although the cost of cotton used in goods manufactured by us has historically represented only of our cost of sales  it has risen to around 
table of contents primarily as a result of cost inflation 
costs incurred for materials and labor are capitalized into inventory and impact our results as the inventory is sold 
inflation can have a long term impact on us because increasing costs of materials and labor may impact our ability to maintain satisfactory margins 
for example  the cost of the materials that are used in our manufacturing process  such as oil related commodities and other raw materials  such as dyes and chemicals  and other costs  such as fuel  energy and utility costs  can fluctuate as a result of inflation and other factors 
similarly  a significant portion of our products are manufactured in other countries and declines in the value of the us dollar may result in higher manufacturing costs 
increases in inflation may not be matched by rises in income  which also could have a negative impact on spending 
if we incur increased costs for materials  including cotton  and labor that we are unable to recoup through price increases or improved efficiencies  or if consumer spending declines  our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected 
given the systemic cost inflation that the apparel industry is currently experiencing  most apparel retailers and manufacturers have announced they will be implementing price increases in in order to maintain satisfactory margins 
higher raw material costs  including cotton  and higher labor costs overseas are the primary reasons that price increases are needed to manage the inflated costs 
other business and industry trends the basic apparel market is highly competitive and evolving rapidly 
competition is generally based upon brand name recognition  price  product quality  selection  service and purchasing convenience 
the majority of our core styles continue from year to year  with variations only in color  fabric or design details 
some products  however  such as intimate apparel  activewear and sheer hosiery  do have more of an emphasis on style and innovation 
our businesses face competition today from other large corporations and foreign manufacturers  as well as smaller companies  department stores  specialty stores and other retailers that market and sell basic apparel products under private labels that compete directly with our brands 
our top ten customers accounted for of our net sales and our top customer  wal mart  accounted for over billion of our sales in our largest customers in were wal mart  target and kohl s  which accounted for  and of total sales  respectively 
the growth in retailers can create pricing pressures as our customers grow larger and seek to have greater concessions in their purchase of our products  while they can be increasingly demanding that we provide them with some of our products on an exclusive basis 
to counteract these effects  it has become increasingly important to leverage our national brands through investment in our largest and strongest brands as our customers strive to maximize their performance especially in today s challenging economic environment 
in addition  during the past several years  various retailers  including some of our largest customers  have experienced significant difficulties  including restructurings  bankruptcies and liquidations  and the ability of retailers to overcome these difficulties may increase due to worldwide economic conditions 
brands are important in our core categories to drive traffic and project required quality and value 
anticipating changes in and managing our operations in response to consumer preferences remains an important element of our business 
in recent years  we have experienced changes in our net sales  revenues and cash flows in accordance with changes in consumer preferences and trends 
for example  we expect the trend of declining hosiery sales to continue consistent with the overall decline in the industry and with shifts in consumer preferences 
the hosiery segment only comprised of our net sales in however  and as a result  the decline in the hosiery segment has not had a significant impact on our net sales  revenues or cash flows 
generally  we manage the hosiery segment for cash  placing an emphasis on reducing our cost structure and managing cash efficiently 
growth platform we have built a powerful three plank growth platform designed to use big brands to increase sales domestically and internationally  use a low cost worldwide supply chain to expand margins  and use strong cash flow to support multiple strategies to create value 
the first plank of our growth platform is the size and power of our brands 
we have made significant investment in our consumer insights capability  innovative product development  and marketing 
we have very large us share positions  with the no 
share in all our innerwear categories and strong positions in outerwear categories  but we have ample opportunities to further build share 
internationally  our commercial markets include mexico  canada  japan  india  brazil and china  where a substantial amount of gross domestic product growth outside the united states will be concentrated over the next decade 

table of contents the second plank of our growth platform is the low cost global supply chain that we have just built 
our low cost  high scale supply chain spans both the western and eastern hemispheres and creates a competitive advantage for us around the globe 
our supply chain has generated significant cost savings  margin expansion and contributions to cash flow and will continue to do so as we further optimize our size  scale and production capability 
to support our growth  we have increased our production capacity such as in our nanjing textile facility  which we expect will ramp up to full capacity by the end of the third plank of our growth platform is our ability to consistently generate strong cash flow 
we have the potential to increase cash flow  and our flexible long term capital structure allows us to use cash in executing multiple strategies for earnings growth  including debt reduction and selective tactical acquisitions 
our key business strategies sell more  spend less and generate cash are our broad strategies to build our brands  reduce our costs and generate cash 
sell more through our sell more strategy  we seek to drive profitable growth by consistently offering consumers brands they love and trust and products with unsurpassed value 
key initiatives we are employing to implement this strategy include build big  strong brands in big core categories with innovative key items 
our ability to react to changing customer needs and industry trends is key to our success 
our design  research and product development teams  in partnership with our marketing teams  drive our efforts to bring innovations to market 
we seek to leverage our insights into consumer demand in the basic apparel industry to develop new products within our existing lines and to modify our existing core products in ways that make them more appealing  addressing changing customer needs and industry trends 
we also support our key brands with targeted  effective advertising and marketing campaigns 
foster strategic partnerships with key retailers via team selling 
we foster relationships with key retailers by applying our extensive category and product knowledge  leveraging our use of multi functional customer management teams and developing new customer specific programs such as c by champion for target and our just my size program at wal mart 
our goal is to strengthen and deepen our existing strategic relationships with retailers and develop new strategic relationships 
use kanban concepts to have the right products available in the right quantities at the right time 
through kanban  a multi initiative effort that determines production quantities  and in doing so  facilitates just in time production and ordering systems  we seek to ensure that products are available to meet customer demands while effectively managing inventory levels 
spend less through our spend less strategy  we seek to become an integrated organization that leverages its size and global reach to reduce costs  improve flexibility and provide a high level of service 
key initiatives we are employing to implement this strategy include optimizing our global supply chain to improve our cost competitiveness and operating flexibility 
we have restructured our supply chain over the past four years to create more efficient production clusters that utilize fewer  larger facilities and to balance our production capability between the western hemisphere and asia 
with our global supply chain infrastructure in place  we are focused long term on optimizing our supply chain to further enhance efficiency  improve working capital and asset turns and reduce costs through several initiatives  such as supplier managed inventory for raw materials and sourced goods ownership arrangements 
we commenced production at our textile production plant in nanjing  china  which is our first company owned textile facility in asia  in the fourth quarter of and we ramped up production in to support our growth  with the expectation of ramping up to full capacity by the end of the nanjing facility  along with our other textile facilities and arrangements with outside contractors  enables us to expand and leverage our production scale as we balance our supply chain across 
table of contents hemispheres to support our production capacity 
we consolidated our distribution network by implementing new warehouse management systems and technology and adding new distribution centers and new third party logistics providers to replace parts of our legacy distribution network  including relocating distribution capacity to our west coast distribution facility in california in order to expand capacity for goods we source from asia 
leverage our global purchasing and manufacturing scale 
historically  we have had a decentralized operating structure with many distinct operating units 
we are in the process of consolidating purchasing  manufacturing and sourcing across all of our product categories in the united states 
we believe that these initiatives will streamline our operations  improve our inventory management  reduce costs and standardize processes 
generate cash through our generate cash strategy  we seek to effectively generate and invest cash at or above our weighted average cost of capital to provide superior returns for both our equity and debt investors 
key initiatives we are employing to implement this strategy include optimizing our capital structure to take advantage of our business model s strong and consistent cash flows 
maintaining appropriate debt leverage and utilizing excess cash to  for example  pay down debt  invest in our own stock and selectively pursue strategic acquisitions are keys to building a stronger business and generating additional value for investors 
in november  we completed a billion senior notes offering and debt refinancing that strengthened and added flexibility to our capital structure by fixing a significant percentage of our debt at favorable interest rates at longer maturities 
continuing to improve turns for accounts receivables  inventory  accounts payable and fixed assets 
our ability to generate cash is enhanced through more efficient management of accounts receivables  inventory  accounts payable and fixed assets through several initiatives  such as supplier managed inventory for raw materials  sourced goods ownership arrangements and other efforts 
global supply chain we have restructured our supply chain over the past four years to create more efficient production clusters that utilize fewer  larger facilities and to balance our production capability between the western hemisphere and asia 
we have closed plant locations  reduced our workforce and relocated some of our manufacturing capacity to lower cost locations in asia  central america and the caribbean basin 
with our global supply chain infrastructure in place  we are focused long term on optimizing our supply chain to further enhance efficiency  improve working capital and asset turns and reduce costs through several initiatives  such as supplier managed inventory for raw materials and sourced goods ownership arrangements

seasonality and other factors our operating results are subject to some variability due to seasonality and other factors 
generally  our diverse range of product offerings helps mitigate the impact of seasonal changes in demand for certain items 
sales are typically higher in the last two quarters july to december of each fiscal year 
socks  hosiery and fleece products generally have higher sales during this period as a result of cooler weather  back to school shopping and holidays 
sales levels in any period are also impacted by customers decisions to increase or decrease their inventory levels in response to anticipated consumer demand 
our customers may cancel orders  change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice to us 
media  advertising and promotion expenses may vary from 
table of contents period to period during a fiscal year depending on the timing of our advertising campaigns for retail selling seasons and product introductions 
although the majority of our products are replenishment in nature and tend to be purchased by consumers on a planned  rather than on an impulse  basis  our sales are impacted by discretionary spending by consumers 
discretionary spending is affected by many factors  including  among others  general business conditions  interest rates  inflation  consumer debt levels  the availability of consumer credit  currency exchange rates  taxation  electricity power rates  gasoline prices  unemployment trends and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending 
many of these factors are outside our control 
consumers purchases of discretionary items  including our products  could decline during periods when disposable income is lower  when prices increase in response to rising costs  or in periods of actual or perceived unfavorable economic conditions 
these consumers may choose to purchase fewer of our products or to purchase lower priced products of our competitors in response to higher prices for our products  or may choose not to purchase our products at prices that reflect our price increases that become effective from time to time 
components of net sales and expenses net sales we generate net sales by selling basic apparel products such as t shirts  bras  panties  men s underwear  kids underwear  socks  hosiery  casualwear and activewear 
our net sales are recognized net of discounts  coupons  rebates  volume based incentives and cooperative advertising costs 
we recognize revenue when i there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  ii the sales price is fixed or determinable  iii title and the risks of ownership have been transferred to the customer and iv collection of the receivable is reasonably assured  which occurs primarily upon shipment 
net sales include an estimate for returns and allowances based upon historical return experience 
we also offer a variety of sales incentives to resellers and consumers that are recorded as reductions to net sales 
royalty income from license agreements with manufacturers of other consumer products that incorporate our brands is also included in net sales 
cost of sales our cost of sales includes the cost of manufacturing finished goods  which consists of labor  raw materials such as cotton and petroleum based products and overhead costs such as depreciation on owned facilities and equipment 
our cost of sales also includes finished goods sourced from third party manufacturers that supply us with products based on our designs as well as charges for slow moving or obsolete inventories 
rebates  discounts and other cash consideration received from a vendor related to inventory purchases are reflected in cost of sales when the related inventory item is sold 
our costs of sales do not include shipping costs  comprised of payments to third party shippers  or handling costs  comprised of warehousing costs in our distribution facilities  and thus our gross margins may not be comparable to those of other entities that include such costs in cost of sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses our selling  general and administrative expenses include selling  advertising  costs of shipping  handling and distribution to our customers  research and development  rent on leased facilities  depreciation on owned facilities and equipment and other general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses also include management payroll  benefits  travel  information systems  accounting  insurance and legal expenses 
restructuring we have from time to time closed facilities and reduced headcount  including in connection with previously announced restructuring and business transformation plans 
we refer to these activities as restructuring actions 
when we decide to close facilities or reduce headcount  we take estimated charges for such restructuring  including charges for exited non cancelable leases and other contractual obligations  as well as severance and benefits 
if the actual charge is different from the original estimate  an adjustment is recognized in the period such change in estimate is identified 

table of contents other expense income our other expense income include charges such as losses on early extinguishment of debt  costs to amend and restate our credit facilities  fees associated with sales of certain trade accounts receivable to financial institutions  and charges related to the termination of certain interest rate hedging arrangements 
interest expense  net our interest expense is net of interest income 
interest income is the return we earned on our cash and cash equivalents 
our cash and cash equivalents are invested in highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less 
income tax expense our effective income tax rate fluctuates from period to period and can be materially impacted by  among other things changes in the mix of our earnings from the various jurisdictions in which we operate  the tax characteristics of our earnings  the timing and amount of earnings of foreign subsidiaries that we repatriate to the united states  which may increase our tax expense and taxes paid  and the timing and results of any reviews of our income tax filing positions in the jurisdictions in which we transact business

the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates in our international segment was primarily due to the strengthening of the us dollar compared to the mexican peso  canadian dollar  euro and brazilian real partially offset by the strengthening of the japanese yen compared to the us dollar during compared to during  we experienced lower net sales  in each case excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates but including the impact of the rd week  in our casualwear business in europe of million  in our male underwear and activewear businesses in japan of million  in our casualwear business in puerto rico of million resulting from moving the distribution capacity to the united states and in our socks and intimate apparel business in canada of million

in october  we completed the sale of our yarn operations as a result of which we ceased making our own yarn and now source all of our yarn requirements from large scale yarn suppliers 
as a result of the sale of our yarn operations we no longer have net sales in our other segment 
general corporate expenses general corporate expenses were million higher in compared to primarily due to higher pension expense of million  million of higher foreign exchange transaction losses and higher other expenses of million related to amending the terms of all outstanding stock options granted under the omnibus incentive plan that had an original term of five or seven years to the tenth anniversary of the original grant date  partially offset by higher gains on sales of assets of million 
in addition  in october  we recognized an million gain related to the sale of our yarn operations to parkdale america 
liquidity and capital resources trends and uncertainties affecting liquidity our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated by operations and availability under our revolving loan facility  accounts receivable securitization facility and international loan facilities 
at january   we had million of borrowing availability under our million revolving loan facility after taking into account outstanding letters of credit  million of borrowing availability under our accounts receivable securitization facility  million in cash and cash equivalents and million of borrowing availability under our international loan facilities 
we currently believe that our existing cash balances and cash generated by operations  together with our available credit capacity  will enable us to comply with the terms of our indebtedness and meet foreseeable liquidity requirements 
the following have impacted or are expected to impact liquidity we have principal and interest obligations under our debt  we expect to continue to invest in efforts to improve operating efficiencies and lower costs  we expect to continue to ramp up and optimize our lower cost manufacturing capacity in asia  central america and the caribbean basin and enhance efficiency  we may selectively pursue strategic acquisitions  we could increase or decrease the portion of the income of our foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the united states  which could significantly impact our effective income tax rate  and 
table of contents our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to million shares of our stock in the open market over the next few years million of which we have repurchased as of january  at a cost of million  although we may choose not to repurchase any stock and instead focus on other uses of cash such as the repayment of our debt 
we expect to be able to manage our working capital levels and capital expenditure amounts to maintain sufficient levels of liquidity 
factors that could help us in these efforts include higher sales volume and the realization of additional cost benefits from previous restructuring and related actions 
we have restructured our supply chain over the past four years to create more efficient production clusters that utilize fewer  larger facilities and to balance production capability between the western hemisphere and asia 
as a result of sales growth in and the expectation of continued sales growth in  we have secured additional capacity with outside contractors to support sales growth 
our working capital increased during  primarily in the form of inventory  to support our higher sales growth 
the inventory increase is the result of both higher input costs and higher unit growth  including unit growth resulting from the gear for sports acquisition 
given cost inflation and higher product pricing  we expect higher working capital in  in particular higher accounts receivable and inventories somewhat offset by increased inventory turns 
with our global supply chain infrastructure in place  we are focused long term on optimizing our supply chain to further enhance efficiency  improve working capital and asset turns and reduce costs through several initiatives  such as supplier managed inventory for raw materials and sourced goods ownership arrangements 
we are operating in an uncertain and volatile economic environment  which could have unanticipated adverse effects on our business 
during  while there was a modest rebound in consumer spending  we also experienced substantial pressure on profitability due to the economic climate  such as higher cotton  energy and labor costs 
rising demand for cotton resulting from the economic recovery  weather related supply disruptions  significant declines in us inventory and a sharp rise in the futures market for cotton have caused cotton prices to surge upward during because of systemic cost inflation  particularly for cotton  energy and labor  we expect to take price increases throughout as warranted by cost inflation  including multiple increases already put in place through late summer 
the timing and frequency of price increases will vary by product category  channel of trade  and country  with some increases as frequently as quarterly 
the magnitude of price increases also will vary by product category 
demand elasticity effects  which could be significant for higher double digit price increases implemented later in the year  should be manageable and will have a muted impact in the hosiery category has been in a state of consistent decline for the past decade  as the trend toward casual dress reduced demand for sheer hosiery 
the hosiery segment comprised only of our net sales in  however  and as a result  the decline in the hosiery segment has not had a significant impact on our net sales or cash flows 
generally  we manage the hosiery segment for cash  placing an emphasis on reducing our cost structure and managing cash efficiently 
cash requirements for our business we rely on our cash flows generated from operations and the borrowing capacity under our revolving loan facility  accounts receivable securitization facility and international loan facilities to meet the cash requirements of our business 
the primary cash requirements of our business are payments to vendors in the normal course of business  capital expenditures  maturities of debt and related interest payments  contributions to our pension plans and repurchases of our stock 
we believe we have sufficient cash and available borrowings for our liquidity needs 
in november  we completed a billion senior notes offering and debt refinancing that strengthened and added flexibility to our capital structure by fixing a significant percentage of our debt at favorable interest rates at longer maturities 
our working capital was higher in compared to  primarily in the form of inventory  to support our higher sales growth 
year end inventory was million higher than year end due to unit growth and after giving effect to the gear for sports acquisition 
in addition  our inventory was higher due to rising input costs such as cotton and oil related materials and the asia supply chain transition and production ramp up 
in we expect working capital to be higher than to support the continued double digit sales growth  price increases and cost inflation 

table of contents capital spending has varied significantly from year to year as we executed our supply chain consolidation and globalization strategy and the integration and consolidation of our technology systems 
we spent million on gross capital expenditures during  which were offset by cash proceeds of million from sales of exited supply chain facilities and sale leaseback transactions 
we expect to continue to invest in our infrastructure during with net capital expenditures approximating million 
during and  we entered into agreements to sell selected trade accounts receivable to financial institutions on a nonrecourse basis 
after the sale  we do not retain any interests in the receivables nor are we involved in the servicing or collection of these receivables 
pension plans our us qualified pension plan is approximately funded as of january  compared to funded as of january  the funded status reflects an increase in the benefit obligation due to a decrease in the discount rate used in the valuation of the liability  partially offset by an increase in the fair value of plan assets as a result of the stock market s performance during because we have elected not to make a voluntary cash contribution in sufficient to achieve a funded status of  beginning april  we are required under the pension protection act to implement restrictions on certain accelerated forms of benefit payments for future retirees 
we performed a thorough review of the impact of making a voluntary cash contribution to the plan in order to maintain a funded level of 
based on our review  and given that these restrictions are expected to impact only a limited number of plan participants  will not impact the total benefits received by plan participants and will not have a material impact on our future cash flows  we determined not to make such a contribution to the plan 
we expect to make required cash contributions of million to million to the us qualified pension plan in based on a preliminary calculation by our actuary 
we expect pension expense in of approximately million compared to million in see note to our financial statements for more information on the plan asset components 
in connection with closing a manufacturing facility in early  we  as required  notified the pension benefit guaranty corporation the pbgc of the closing and requested a liability determination under section e of the employee retirement income security act of  as amended erisa  with respect to the national textiles  llc pension plan 
in september  we entered into an agreement with the pbgc under which we agreed to contribute million to the plan  million of which we contributed in each of september and september in june  the us congress passed legislation that provides for pension funding relief for companies with defined benefit pension plans by allowing those companies to choose between two alternative funding schedules amortizing funding shortfalls over years for any two plan years between and  or paying interest on a funding shortfall for only two plan years of the employer s choosing after which a seven year amortization would apply 
we expect either funding relief option could benefit us with improved cash flow starting in due to expected lower pension contributions  however neither option will improve total cash flow 
we are working with our actuaries to quantify the magnitude of the short term impact on us 
share repurchase program on february   we announced that our board of directors granted authority for the repurchase of up to million shares of our common stock 
share repurchases are made periodically in open market transactions  and are subject to market conditions  legal requirements and other factors 
additionally  management has been granted authority to establish a trading plan under rule b of the exchange act in connection with share repurchases  which will allow us to repurchase shares in the open market during periods in which the stock trading window is otherwise closed for our company and certain of our officers and employees pursuant to our insider trading policy 
since inception of the program  we have purchased million shares of our common stock at a cost of million average price of 
the primary objective of our share repurchase program is to reduce the impact of dilution caused by the exercise of options and vesting of stock unit awards 
while we may repurchase additional stock under the program  we may choose not to repurchase any stock and focus more on other uses of cash in the next twelve months

critical accounting policies and estimates we have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to accurately and fairly report our operating results and financial condition in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
we apply these accounting policies in a consistent manner 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note  titled summary of significant accounting policies  to our financial statements 
the application of critical accounting policies requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures 
these estimates and assumptions are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and may retain outside consultants to assist in our evaluation 
if actual results ultimately differ from previous estimates  the revisions are included in results of operations in the period in which the actual amounts become known 
the critical accounting policies that involve the most significant management judgments and estimates used in preparation of our financial statements  or are the most sensitive to change from outside factors  are described below 
sales recognition and incentives we recognize revenue when i there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  ii the sales price is fixed or determinable  iii title and the risks of ownership have been transferred to the customer and iv collection of the receivable is reasonably assured  which occurs primarily upon shipment 
we record provisions for any uncollectible amounts based upon our historical collection statistics and current customer information 
our management reviews these estimates each quarter and makes adjustments based upon actual experience 
note d  titled summary of significant accounting policies sales recognition and incentives  to our financial statements describes a variety of sales incentives that we offer to resellers and consumers of our products 
measuring the cost of these incentives requires  in many cases  estimating future customer utilization and redemption rates 
we use historical data for similar transactions to estimate the cost of current incentive programs 
our management reviews these estimates each quarter and makes adjustments based upon actual experience and other available information 
we classify the costs associated with cooperative advertising as a reduction of net sales in our consolidated statements of income 

table of contents accounts receivable valuation accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due from customers 
we carry our accounts receivable at their net realizable value 
in determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts  we consider a combination of factors  such as the aging of trade receivables  industry trends  and our customers financial strength  credit standing  and payment and default history 
changes in the aforementioned factors  among others  may lead to adjustments in our allowance for doubtful accounts 
the calculation of the required allowance requires judgment by our management as to the impact of these and other factors on the ultimate realization of our trade receivables 
charges to the allowance for doubtful accounts are reflected in the selling  general and administrative expenses line and charges to the allowance for customer chargebacks and other customer deductions are primarily reflected as a reduction in the net sales line of our consolidated statements of income 
our management reviews these estimates each quarter and makes adjustments based upon actual experience 
because we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers  actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  a large reserve might be required 
the amount of actual historical losses has not varied materially from our estimates for bad debts 
inventory valuation we carry inventory on our balance sheet at the estimated lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the first in  first out  or fifo  method for our inventories 
we carry obsolete  damaged  and excess inventory at the net realizable value  which we determine by assessing historical recovery rates  current market conditions and our future marketing and sales plans 
because our assessment of net realizable value is made at a point in time  there are inherent uncertainties related to our value determination 
market factors and other conditions underlying the net realizable value may change  resulting in further reserve requirements 
a reduction in the carrying amount of an inventory item from cost to market value creates a new cost basis for the item that cannot be reversed at a later period 
while we believe that adequate write downs for inventory obsolescence have been provided in the financial statements  consumer tastes and preferences will continue to change and we could experience additional inventory write downs in the future 
rebates  discounts and other cash consideration received from a vendor related to inventory purchases are reflected as reductions in the cost of the related inventory item  and are therefore reflected in cost of sales when the related inventory item is sold 
income taxes deferred taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we have recorded deferred taxes related to operating losses and capital loss carryforwards 
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income in specific jurisdictions  the amount and timing of which are uncertain  possible changes in tax laws and tax planning strategies 
if in our judgment it appears that we will not be able to generate sufficient taxable income or capital gains to offset losses during the carryforward periods  we have recorded valuation allowances to reduce those deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be ultimately realized 
an adjustment to income tax expense would be required in a future period if we determine that the amount of deferred tax assets to be realized differs from the net recorded amount 
federal income taxes are provided on that portion of our income of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the united states and be taxable  reflecting the decisions made by us with regards to earnings permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions 
decisions we make as to the amount of earnings permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions  due to anticipated cash flow or other business requirements  may impact our federal income tax provision and effective tax rate 
we periodically estimate the probable tax obligations using historical experience in tax jurisdictions and our informed judgment 
there are inherent uncertainties related to the interpretation of tax regulations in the jurisdictions in which we transact business 
the judgments and estimates made at a point in time may change based on the outcome of tax audits  as well as changes to  or further interpretations of  regulations 
income tax expense is adjusted in the period in which these events occur  and these adjustments are included in our consolidated 
table of contents statements of income 
if such changes take place  there is a risk that our effective tax rate may increase or decrease in any period 
a company must recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 
we recognized a change in our estimate of unrecognized tax benefit accruals of million in this change in estimate resulted from the circumstances described above in consolidated results of operations year ended january  compared with year ended january   and was not a result of any change in the application of our accounting policies 
in conjunction with the spin off  we and sara lee entered into a tax sharing agreement  which allocates responsibilities between us and sara lee for taxes and certain other tax matters 
under the tax sharing agreement  sara lee generally is liable for all us federal  state  local and foreign income taxes attributable to us with respect to taxable periods ending on or before september  sara lee also is liable for income taxes attributable to us with respect to taxable periods beginning before september  and ending after september   but only to the extent those taxes are allocable to the portion of the taxable period ending on september  we are generally liable for all other taxes attributable to us 
changes in the amounts payable or receivable by us under the stipulations of this agreement may impact our tax provision in any period 
under the tax sharing agreement  within days after sara lee filed its final consolidated tax return for the period that included september   sara lee was required to deliver to us a computation of the amount of deferred taxes attributable to our united states and canadian operations that would be included on our opening balance sheet as of september  as finally determined which has been done 
we have the right to participate in the computation of the amount of deferred taxes 
under the tax sharing agreement  if substituting the amount of deferred taxes as finally determined for the amount of estimated deferred taxes that were included on that balance sheet at the time of the spin off causes a decrease in the net book value reflected on that balance sheet  then sara lee will be required to pay us the amount of such decrease 
if such substitution causes an increase in the net book value reflected on that balance sheet  then we will be required to pay sara lee the amount of such increase 
for purposes of this computation  our deferred taxes are the amount of deferred tax benefits including deferred tax consequences attributable to deductible temporary differences and carryforwards that would be recognized as assets on the company s balance sheet computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  but without regard to valuation allowances  less the amount of deferred tax liabilities including deferred tax consequences attributable to taxable temporary differences that would be recognized as liabilities on our opening balance sheet computed in accordance with gaap  but without regard to valuation allowances 
neither we nor sara lee will be required to make any other payments to the other with respect to deferred taxes 
based on our computation of the final amount of deferred taxes for our opening balance sheet as of september   the amount that is expected to be collected from sara lee based on our computation of million  which reflects a preliminary cash installment received from sara lee of million  is included as a receivable in other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets as of january  and january  we exchanged information with sara lee in connection with this matter  but sara lee disagreed with our computation 
in accordance with the dispute resolution provisions of the tax sharing agreement  in august  we submitted the dispute to binding arbitration 
the arbitration process is ongoing  and we will continue to prosecute our claim 
we do not believe that the resolution of this dispute will have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
stock compensation we established the omnibus incentive plan to award stock options  stock appreciation rights  restricted stock  restricted stock units  deferred stock units  performance shares and cash to our employees  non employee directors and employees of our subsidiaries to promote the interest of our company and incent performance and retention of employees 
stock based compensation is estimated at the grant date based on the award s fair value and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
estimation of stock based compensation for stock options granted  utilizing the black scholes option pricing model  requires various highly subjective assumptions including volatility and expected option life 
we use a combination of the volatility of our company and the volatility of peer 
table of contents companies for a period of time that is comparable to the expected life of the option to determine volatility assumptions 
we utilize the simplified method outlined in sec accounting rules to estimate expected lives for options granted 
the simplified method is used for valuing stock option grants by eligible public companies that do not have sufficient historical exercise patterns on options granted to employees 
we estimate forfeitures for stock based awards granted that are not expected to vest 
if any of these inputs or assumptions changes significantly  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
defined benefit pension plans for a discussion of our net periodic benefit cost  plan obligations  plan assets  and how we measure the amount of these costs  see note titled defined benefit pension plans to our consolidated financial statements 
our us qualified pension plan is approximately funded as of january  compared to funded as of january  the funded status reflects an increase in the benefit obligation due to a decrease in the discount rate used in the valuation of the liability  partially offset by an increase in the fair value of plan assets as a result of the stock market s performance during because we have elected not to make a voluntary cash contribution in sufficient to achieve a funded status of  beginning april  we are required under the pension protection act to implement restrictions on certain accelerated forms of benefit payments for future retirees 
we performed a thorough review of the impact of making a voluntary cash contribution to the plan in order to maintain a funded level of 
based on our review  and given that these restrictions are expected to impact only a limited number of plan participants  will not impact the total benefits received by plan participants and will not have a material impact on our future cash flows  we determined not to make such a contribution to the plan 
we expect to make required cash contributions of million to million to the us qualified pension plan in based on a preliminary calculation by our actuary 
see note to our financial statements for more information on the plan asset components 
the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans are recognized on our balance sheet and changes in the funded status are reflected in comprehensive income 
we measure the funded status of our plans as of the date of our fiscal year end 
we expect pension expense in of approximately million compared to million in the net periodic cost of the pension plans is determined using projections and actuarial assumptions  the most significant of which are the discount rate and the long term rate of asset return 
the net periodic pension income or expense is recognized in the year incurred 
gains and losses  which occur when actual experience differs from actuarial assumptions  are amortized over the average future expected life of participants 
our policies regarding the establishment of pension assumptions are as follows in determining the discount rate  we utilized the citigroup pension discount curve rounded to the nearest basis points in order to determine a unique interest rate for each plan and match the expected cash flows for each plan 
salary increase assumptions were based on historical experience and anticipated future management actions 
the salary increase assumption only applies to the canadian plans and portions of the hanesbrands nonqualified retirement plans  as benefits under these plans are not frozen 
the benefits under the hanesbrands inc pension plan were frozen as of december  in determining the long term rate of return on plan assets we applied a proportionally weighted blend between assuming the historical long term compound growth rate of the plan portfolio would predict the future returns of similar investments  and the utilization of forward looking assumptions 
retirement rates were based primarily on actual experience while standard actuarial tables were used to estimate mortality 

table of contents the sensitivity of changes in actuarial assumptions on our annual pension expense and on our plans projected benefit obligations  all other factors being equal  is illustrated by the following increase decrease in projected benefit in millions pension expense obligation decrease in discount rate increase in discount rate decrease in expected investment return increase in expected investment return trademarks and other identifiable intangibles trademarks  license agreements  customer and distributor relationships and computer software are our primary identifiable intangible assets 
we amortize identifiable intangibles with finite lives  and we do not amortize identifiable intangibles with indefinite lives 
we base the estimated useful life of an identifiable intangible asset upon a number of factors  including the effects of demand  competition  expected changes in distribution channels and the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain future cash flows 
as of january   the net book value of trademarks and other identifiable intangible assets was million  of which we are amortizing the entire balance 
we anticipate that our amortization expense for will be million 
we evaluate identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization for impairment using a process similar to that used to evaluate asset amortization described below under depreciation and impairment of property  plant and equipment 
we assess identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization for impairment at least annually and more often as triggering events occur 
in order to determine the impairment of identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization  we compare the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying amount 
we recognize an impairment loss for the amount by which an identifiable intangible asset s carrying value exceeds its fair value 
we measure a trademark s fair value using the royalty saved method 
we determine the royalty saved method by evaluating various factors to discount anticipated future cash flows  including operating results  business plans  and present value techniques 
the rates we use to discount cash flows are based on interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time 
because there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them  the assumptions underlying the impairment analysis may change in such a manner that impairment in value may occur in the future 
such impairment will be recognized in the period in which it becomes known 
goodwill as of january   we had million of goodwill 
we do not amortize goodwill  but we assess for impairment at least annually and more often as triggering events occur 
the timing of our annual goodwill impairment testing is the first day of the third fiscal quarter 
the estimated fair values significantly exceeded the carrying values of each of our reporting units as of the first day of the third fiscal quarter  and no impairment of goodwill was identified as a result of the testing conducted in in evaluating the recoverability of goodwill  we estimate the fair value of our reporting units 
we rely on a number of factors to determine the fair value of our reporting units and evaluate various factors to discount anticipated future cash flows  including operating results  business plans  and present value techniques 
as discussed above under trademarks and other identifiable intangibles  there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors  and our judgment in applying them and the assumptions underlying the impairment analysis may change in such a manner that impairment in value may occur in the future 
such impairment will be recognized in the period in which it becomes known 

table of contents we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill using a two step process based on an evaluation of reporting units 
the first step involves a comparison of a reporting unit s fair value to its carrying value 
in the second step  if the reporting unit s carrying value exceeds its fair value  we compare the goodwill s implied fair value and its carrying value 
if the goodwill s carrying value exceeds its implied fair value  we recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to such excess 
depreciation and impairment of property  plant and equipment we state property  plant and equipment at its historical cost  and we compute depreciation using the straight line method over the asset s life 
we estimate an asset s life based on historical experience  manufacturers estimates  engineering or appraisal evaluations  our future business plans and the period over which the asset will economically benefit us  which may be the same as or shorter than its physical life 
our policies require that we periodically review our assets remaining depreciable lives based upon actual experience and expected future utilization 
a change in the depreciable life is treated as a change in accounting estimate and the accelerated depreciation is accounted for in the period of change and future periods 
based upon current levels of depreciation  the average remaining depreciable life of our net property other than land is five years 
we test an asset for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable 
such events include significant adverse changes in business climate  several periods of operating or cash flow losses  forecasted continuing losses or a current expectation that an asset or asset group will be disposed of before the end of its useful life 
we evaluate an asset s recoverability by comparing the asset or asset group s net carrying amount to the future net undiscounted cash flows we expect such asset or asset group will generate 
if we determine that an asset is not recoverable  we recognize an impairment loss in the amount by which the asset s carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value 
when we recognize an impairment loss for an asset held for use  we depreciate the asset s adjusted carrying amount over its remaining useful life 
we do not restore previously recognized impairment losses if circumstances change 
insurance reserves we maintain insurance coverage for property  workers compensation and other casualty programs 
we are responsible for losses up to certain limits and are required to estimate a liability that represents the ultimate exposure for aggregate losses below those limits 
this liability is based on management s estimates of the ultimate costs to be incurred to settle known claims and claims not reported as of the balance sheet date 
the estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors  including historical trends  actuarial assumptions and economic conditions 
if actual trends differ from the estimates  the financial results could be impacted 
actual trends have not differed materially from the estimates 
assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations we account for business acquisitions using the purchase method  which requires us to allocate the cost of an acquired business to the acquired assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date 
we recognize the excess of an acquired business s cost over the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities as goodwill 
we use a variety of information sources to determine the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities 
we generally use third party appraisers to determine the fair value and lives of property and identifiable intangibles  consulting actuaries to determine the fair value of obligations associated with defined benefit pension plans  and legal counsel to assess obligations associated with legal and environmental claims 
recently issued accounting pronouncements fair value disclosures in january  the financial accounting standards board issued new accounting rules related to the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements 
the new accounting rules require new disclosures regarding 
table of contents significant transfers between levels and of the fair value hierarchy and the activity within level of the fair value hierarchy 
the new accounting rules also clarify existing disclosures regarding the level of disaggregation of assets or liabilities and the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value 
the new accounting rules were effective for us in the first quarter of  except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the rollforward of activity in level fair value measurements 
those disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
the adoption of the disclosures effective for our first quarter of did not have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows but resulted in certain additional disclosures reflected in note to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices 
our risk management control system uses analytical techniques including market value  sensitivity analysis and value at risk estimations 
foreign exchange risk we sell the majority of our products in transactions denominated in us dollars  however  we purchase some raw materials  pay a portion of our wages and make other payments in our supply chain in foreign currencies 
our exposure to foreign exchange rates exists primarily with respect to the canadian dollar  european euro  mexican peso and japanese yen against the us dollar 
we use foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge material exposure to adverse changes in foreign exchange rates 
a sensitivity analysis technique has been used to evaluate the effect that changes in the market value of foreign exchange currencies will have on our forward and option contracts 
at january   the potential change in fair value of foreign currency derivative instruments  assuming a adverse change in the underlying currency price  was million 
interest rates our debt under the revolving loan facility  floating rate senior notes and accounts receivable securitization facility bears interest at variable rates 
as a result  we are exposed to changes in market interest rates that could impact the cost of servicing our debt 
we were required under the senior secured credit facility to hedge a portion of our floating rate debt to reduce interest rate risk caused by floating rate debt issuance 
to comply with this requirement  in the first quarter of we entered into a hedging arrangement whereby we capped the libor interest rate component on million of the floating rate debt under the floating rate senior notes at 
in addition  in november  we completed a billion senior notes offering and debt refinancing that strengthened and added flexibility to our capital structure by fixing a significant percentage of our debt at favorable interest rates at longer maturities 
as a result  approximately of our total debt outstanding at january  is now at a fixed or capped rate 
after giving effect to these arrangements  a basis point movement in the annual interest rate charged on the outstanding debt balances as of january  would result in a change in annual interest expense of million 
we may also execute interest rate cash flow hedges in the form of caps and swaps in the future in order to mitigate our exposure to variability in cash flows for the future interest payments on a designated portion of borrowings 
commodities cotton is the primary raw material used in manufacturing many of our products 
while we have sold our yarn operations  we are still exposed to fluctuations in the cost of cotton 
during  cotton prices hit their highest levels in years 
increases in the cost of cotton can result in higher costs in the price we pay for yarn from our large scale yarn suppliers 
our costs for cotton yarn and cotton based textiles vary based upon the fluctuating cost of cotton  which is affected by  among other things  weather  consumer demand  speculation on the commodities market  the relative valuations and fluctuations of the currencies of producer versus consumer countries and other factors that are generally unpredictable and beyond our control 
we are able to lock in the cost of cotton reflected in the price we pay for yarn from our primary yarn suppliers in an attempt to protect our business from the volatility of the market price of cotton 
however  our business can be affected by dramatic movements in cotton prices 
although the cost of cotton used in goods manufactured by us has 
table of contents historically represented only of our cost of sales  it has risen to around primarily as a result of cost inflation 
the cotton prices reflected in our results were cents per pound in and cents per pound in costs incurred for materials and labor are capitalized into inventory and impact our results as the inventory is sold 
for example  we estimate that a change of per pound in cotton prices at current levels of production would affect our annual cost of sales by million related to finished goods manufactured internally in our manufacturing facilities and million related to finished goods sourced from third parties 
the ultimate effect of this change on our earnings cannot be quantified  as the effect of movements in cotton prices on industry selling prices are uncertain  but any dramatic increase in the price of cotton would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
in addition  fluctuations in crude oil or petroleum prices may influence the prices of other raw materials we use to manufacture our products  such as chemicals  dyestuffs  polyester yarn and foam 
we generally purchase raw materials at market prices 
we estimate that a change of per barrel in the price of oil would affect our freight costs by approximately million  at current levels of usage
