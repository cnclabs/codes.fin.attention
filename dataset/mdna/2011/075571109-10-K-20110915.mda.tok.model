the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements  which involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth under risks factors under item a of this report

fiscal financial highlights include the following net sales from continuing operations for fiscal were million  up from million for fiscal comparable store sales for fiscal increased compared to a decrease of in the previous fiscal year 
gross margin from continuing operations for fiscal was compared to for fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses from continuing operations for the fiscal year were million  up from million for fiscal net income from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended july  was million  or per share on a diluted basis  compared to net income of million  or per share on a diluted basis in the prior year 
in fiscal  cash decreased by million  down from an increase of million for fiscal  primarily as a result of our special dividend declared in fiscal and paid out in fiscal and stock repurchases made during the fiscal year 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  many of which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
such differences could be material to the financial statements 
we believe our application of accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required therein  are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are constantly reevaluated  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
we have identified certain critical accounting policies  which are described below 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue at the time the products are received by the customers 
revenue is recognized for store sales at the point at which the customer receives and pays for the merchandise at the register 
for on line sales  we recognize revenue at the time we estimate the customer receives the product 
we estimate and defer revenue and the related product costs for shipments that are in transit to the customer 
customers typically receive goods within one week of shipment 
we reflect amounts related to shipping billed to customers in net sales and the related costs in cost of goods sold 
retail sales are recorded net of sales tax collected from customers at the time of the transaction 
we record a reserve for estimated product returns based on historical return trends 
if actual returns are greater than those projected  we may record additional sales returns in the future 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our sales return reserve 
however  if the actual rate of sales returns increases significantly  our operating results could be adversely affected 
discounts offered to customers consist primarily of point of sale markdowns and are recorded at the time of the related sale as a reduction of revenue 
we include the value of points and rewards earned by our loyalty program members as a liability and a reduction of revenue at the time the points and rewards are earned based on historical conversion and redemption rates 
we recognize the associated revenue when the rewards are redeemed or expire 
gift certificates sold are recorded as a liability and sales revenue is recognized when the gift certificate is redeemed 
similarly  customers may receive a store credit in exchange for returned goods 
we carry store credits as a liability until redeemed 
we recognize unredeemed store credits and gift certificates as other income three and four years  respectively  after issuance  which is when management deems redemptions to be remote 
in addition  we sell gift cards with no expiration dates to customers in our retail store locations  through our online stores  and through third parties 
we recognize sales revenue from gift cards when they are redeemed by the customer 
in addition  we recognize income on unredeemed gift cards when we can determine that the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed is remote and there is no legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift cards to relevant jurisdictions gift card breakage 
we determine gift card breakage income based on historical redemption patterns 
we accumulated sufficient historical data to determine elapsed time for recording breakage income during the second quarter of fiscal  which we estimate is four years 
gift card breakage is included as other income within selling  general and administrative expenses 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our breakage income 
however  if the actual rate of redemption for gift certificates  store credits  and gift cards increases significantly  our operating results could be adversely affected 
we record royalty revenue from product licensees as the greater of the minimum amount guaranteed in the contract or amount sold 
we recognize wholesale licensee revenue from sale of product to international licensee operated bebe stores at the time we estimate the licensee receives shipment 
we exclude these stores from comparable store sales 
stock based compensation we recognize stock based awards to employees as compensation expense  based on the calculated fair value on the date of grant 
we determine the fair value using the black scholes option pricing model 
this model requires subjective assumptions  which are affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
as the stock based compensation expense recognized on the consolidated statements of operations for fiscal  and is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  such amount has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we estimate forfeitures based on our historical experience over the last ten years 
inventories 
we state inventories at the lower of weighted average cost or market 
we determine market based on the estimated net realizable value  which is generally the merchandise selling price 
to ensure that our raw material is properly valued  we age the fabric inventory and record a reserve in accordance with our established policy  which is based on historical experience 
to ensure our finished goods inventory is properly valued  we review the age and turnover of our inventory and record an adjustment if the selling price is estimated to be marked down below cost 
these assumptions can have an impact on current and future operating results and financial position 
we estimate and record shrinkage for the period between the last physical count and balance sheet date based on historic shrinkage trends 
investments 
we hold a variety of interest bearing auction rate securities ars consisting of federally insured student loan backed securities and insured municipal authority bonds 
as of july   our ars portfolio totaled approximately million  net of a temporary impairment charge of million  classified as available for sale securities 
these ars investments are intended to provide liquidity via an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined calendar intervals  allowing investors to either roll over their holdings or gain immediate liquidity by selling such interests at par 
the uncertainties in the credit markets that began in february have affected our holdings in ars investments and auctions for our investments in these securities have failed to settle on their respective settlement dates 
historically the fair value of ars investments had approximated par value due to the frequent resets through the auction process 
while we continue to earn interest on our ars investments at the maximum contractual rate  these investments are not currently trading and therefore do not currently have a readily determinable market value 
accordingly  the estimated fair value of ars no longer approximates par value 
consequently  the investments are not currently liquid  and we will not be able to access these funds until a future auction of these investments is successful  the issuer redeems the securities  or at maturity 
maturity dates for these ars range from to with principal distributions occurring on certain securities prior to maturity 
we also hold short term available for sale securities totaling million at july  that consist of treasury bills and certificates of deposit 
we review our investments for impairment in accordance with guidance issued by the fasb and sec in order to determine the classification of the impairment as temporary or other than temporary 
a temporary impairment charge results in an unrealized loss being recorded in the other comprehensive income component of shareholders equity 
such an unrealized loss does not affect net income for the applicable accounting period 
an other than temporary impairment charge is recorded as a loss in the consolidated statement of operations and reduces net income for the applicable accounting period 
when evaluating the investments for other than temporary impairment  we estimate the expected cash flows of the underlying collateral by reviewing factors such as the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been below cost basis  the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto  and our intent to sell  or whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell  the investment before recovery of the investment s unamortized cost basis 
the valuation of our investment portfolio is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict 
factors that may impact our valuation include changes to credit ratings of the issuers of the securities as well as to the underlying assets supporting those securities  rates of default of the underlying assets  underlying collateral value  discount rates and ongoing strength and quality of market credit and liquidity 
impairment of long lived assets 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances  such as planned or actual store closures or poor performing stores  indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
assets are grouped and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level of which there are identifiable cash flows  which is generally at a store level 
store assets are reviewed using factors including  but not limited to  the company s future operating plans and projected cash flows 
the determination of whether impairment has occurred is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows directly related to that store  compared to the carrying value of the assets 
if the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows of a store does not exceed the carrying value of the assets  full or partial impairment may exist 
for impaired assets  we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the net book value of the asset and its estimated fair value 
fair value is based upon discounted future cash flows of the asset using a discount rate commensurate with the risk 
in addition  at the time a decision is made to close a store  we record an impairment charge  if appropriate  or accelerate depreciation over the revised useful life of the asset 
during fiscal  we recorded a million charge for the impairment of store assets 
we recorded an million impairment charge in fiscal  of which million related to our discontinued operations  and an impairment charge of million during fiscal  of which million related to our discontinued operations 
we believe at this time that the long lived assets carrying values and useful lives continue to be appropriate  however significant changes from our current future forecasts could result in additional impairment charges 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
we are subject to periodic audits by the internal revenue service and other foreign  state and local taxing authorities 
these audits may challenge certain of our tax positions such as the timing and amount of income and deductions and the allocation of taxable income to various tax jurisdictions 
we evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes 
to the extent that our estimates change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made 
our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings  changes in the expected outcome of audits or changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance 
recent accounting pronouncements fair value in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu to amend and clarify existing guidance related to fair value measurements and disclosures 
this guidance adds new requirements for disclosures related to transfers into and out of level and level and requires separate disclosure of purchases  sales  issuances and settlements related to level measurements 
it also clarifies guidance around disaggregation and disclosures of inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
our adoption of the provisions of this standard  on july  has not had a material impact on our consolidated financial position  statements of operations or cash flows 
other comprehensive income in june  the fasb issued asu  which requires that all non owner changes in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
in the two statement approach  the first statement should present total net income and its components followed consecutively by a second statement that should present total other comprehensive income  the components of other comprehensive income and the total of comprehensive income 
for public entities  the amendments in asu are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december   and are to be applied retrospectively  with early adoption permitted 
we are currently evaluating the impact of asu on our financial statement presentation of comprehensive income 
results of operations our fiscal year ends on the first saturday after june fiscal  and each included weeks 
the following table sets forth certain financial data as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated fiscal year ended july  july  july  statement of operating data net sales cost of sales  including production and occupancy gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses operating income interest and other income  net income from continuing operations before income taxes provision for income taxes income from continuing operations  net of tax loss from discontinued operations  net of tax net income loss cost of sales includes the cost of merchandise  occupancy costs and production costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses primarily consist of non occupancy store costs  corporate overhead and advertising costs 
fiscal years ended july  and july  net sales 
net sales from continuing operations increased to million during the fiscal year ended july  from million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
the increase in net sales was primarily attributable to a increase in comparable store sales resulting primarily from increased conversion in stores as well as an increase in wholesale sales of million  or gross margin 
gross margin from continuing operations decreased to million for the fiscal year ended july  from million in fiscal  a decrease of million  or 
as a percentage of net sales  gross margin of was lower than the prior year at primarily due to a decrease in initial markup  caused by change in product mix and higher production costs  partially offset by lower markdown activity 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses from continuing operations  which primarily consist of non occupancy store costs  corporate overhead and advertising costs  increased to million during fiscal from million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
this increase in dollars was primarily a result of million of settlement costs recorded during the year 
prior year adjustments included million related to stock based compensation offset by other credits  including the initial recognition of gift card breakage income 
as a percentage of net sales  these expenses decreased to during fiscal from in fiscal this decrease as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to leveraging of store depreciation expense and other fixed costs 
interest and other income  net 
we generated million of interest and other income  net of other expenses  during fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the decrease in interest and other income resulted from a one time settlement of our ubs auction rate securities in the prior year as well as investments in lower yielding tax exempt investments and money market funds 
provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rate from continuing operations was for fiscal as compared to for fiscal the overall decrease in the effective tax rate was attributable to the release of tax reserves and reduction in foreign income tax 
discontinued operations 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we decided to discontinue operations of the ph division  allowing us to focus our efforts on improving bebe sales and profitability  expanding internationally and continuing to develop our b bebe business 
we closed ph stores in the first fiscal quarter of and during the second fiscal quarter of  closed the remaining ph stores  converting one store to a b bebe 
the results of the ph stores closed to date  net of income tax benefit  which consists of  and stores for the fiscal years ended july   july  and july   respectively  have been presented as a discontinued operation in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented and are as follows fiscal year ended july  july  july  in thousands net sales cost of sales  including production and occupancy gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses loss from discontinued operations  before income tax benefit add tax benefit loss from discontinued operations  net of tax benefit fiscal years ended july  and july  net sales 
net sales from continuing operations decreased to million during the fiscal year ended july  from million in fiscal  a decrease of million  or 
the decrease in net sales was primarily attributable to a decrease in comparable store sales resulting primarily from the lower traffic and conversion in stores  a reduced customer acceptance of the merchandise offering  and an decrease in our on line sales 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in wholesale sales of million  or 
gross margin 
gross margin from continuing operations decreased to million for the fiscal year ended july  from million in fiscal  a decrease of million  or 
as a percentage of net sales  gross margin of was lower than the prior year at primarily due to unfavorable occupancy leverage partially offset by lower markdown activity 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses from continuing operations  which primarily consist of non occupancy store costs  corporate overhead and advertising costs  decreased to million during fiscal from million in fiscal  a decrease of million  or 
this decrease in dollars was a result of lower compensation and advertising expense  and gift card breakage income recorded for the first time beginning in the second quarter of fiscal  offset by a million non cash stock based compensation adjustment primarily related to prior years that resulted from errors caused by flaws in third party software 
we determined that the impact of this error is not material to the previously issued annual consolidated financial statements 
we do not believe that the correction of this error is material to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended july  as a percentage of net sales  these expenses increased to during fiscal from in fiscal this increase as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to deleveraging of store depreciation expense and other fixed costs  fixed asset impairments and the costs associated with the previously mentioned adjustment related to stock based compensation 
interest and other income  net 
we generated million of interest and other income  net of other expenses  during fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the decrease in interest and other income resulted from investments in lower yielding tax exempt investments and money market funds 
provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rate was for fiscal as compared to for fiscal the increase in the overall effective tax rate is attributable to the reduction of tax exempt interest and increase in foreign income tax 
seasonality of business and quarterly results our business varies with general seasonal trends that are characteristic of the retail and apparel industries 
as a result  our typical store generates a higher percentage of its annual net sales and profitability in the second quarter of our fiscal year  which includes the holiday selling season  compared to other quarters of our fiscal year 
if for any reason our sales were below seasonal norms during the second quarter of our fiscal year  our annual operating results would be negatively impacted 
because of the seasonality of our business  results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year 
liquidity and capital resources our working capital requirements vary widely throughout the year and generally peak during the first and second fiscal quarters 
at july   we had approximately million of cash  cash equivalents and investments on hand of which were cash and equivalents  approximately million  net of impairment charges of million  were auction rate securities ars  approximately million were treasury bills and approximately million were certificates of deposit 
we do not anticipate the lack of liquidity in the ars to impact our ability to fund our operations in the foreseeable future and believe we have sufficient cash and equivalents to fund ongoing operations 
in addition  we have a revolving line of credit under which we may borrow or issue letters of credit up to a combined total of million 
as of july   there were no cash borrowings outstanding under the line of credit  and letters of credit outstanding totaled million as well as million of an outstanding stand by letter of credit 
to date  no beneficiary has drawn upon the stand by letter of credit 
as of july   we were in compliance with all covenants 
at july   we had cash and cash equivalents of million held in accounts managed by third party financial institutions consisting of invested cash and cash in our operating accounts 
the invested cash is invested in interest bearing funds managed by third party financial institutions 
these funds invest in direct obligations of the government of the united states 
to date  we have experienced no loss or lack of access to our invested cash or equivalents  however  we can provide no assurances that access to our invested cash and equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets 
we hold our operating and invested cash in accounts that are with third party financial institutions 
the balances in these accounts exceed the federal deposit insurance corporation insurance limits 
while we monitor daily the cash balances in our operating accounts and adjust the cash balances as appropriate  these cash balances could be impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail or could be subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets 
to date  we have experienced no loss or lack of access to invested cash or cash in our operating accounts 
net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal  and was million  million and million  respectively 
there were significant decreased changes in working capital of million from fiscal to fiscal primarily related to a smaller increase in prepaid and other as a result of an income tax refund received in the prior fiscal year  settlement of our income tax payable as well as our ability to maintain the lower inventory levels that were implemented in the prior fiscal year 
the change from fiscal to was a result of decreased changes in net income of million which were offset by changes in working capital of million over the prior fiscal year primarily related to an income tax refund received and a reduction in our inventory levels 
net cash used by investing activities was million versus net cash provided by investing activities of million and net cash used by investing activities of million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in cash used by investing activities in was primarily a result of a decrease in net proceeds of marketable equity securities of million primarily as a result of our ubs settlement at par in the prior fiscal year partially offset by increased purchases of marketable securities of million and the purchase of the bebe trademark in china for million in fiscal the change from fiscal to was primarily a result of an increase in net proceeds of marketable equity securities of million primarily as a result of our ubs settlement at par  and a decrease in the purchase of property  plant and equipment of million partially offset by increased purchases of marketable securities of million 
capital expenditures of million cash  plus a net change in the accrual of million  in fiscal primarily included million related to the opening of new stores  million related to the relocation and expansion of existing stores and million related to investments in management information systems 
capital expenditures of million in fiscal primarily consisted of million related to the opening of new stores  million related to the relocation and expansion of existing stores and million related to investments in management information systems 
we opened  and new stores in fiscal  and  respectively  and we expect to open stores in fiscal in fiscal  we expect capital expenditures of approximately million  of which approximately million will be for new stores and relocation and expansion of existing stores and approximately million will be for investments in information systems and other capital expenditures 
during fiscal  the average bebe and b bebe new store construction costs before tenant allowances were  and the average gross inventory investment per store was  net cash used by financing activities was million in fiscal compared to net cash used by financing activities of million in fiscal the increase in cash used by financing activities of million was primarily a result of the payout of the special per share dividend declared in the fourth quarter of fiscal as well an increase in our stock repurchases of million over the prior fiscal year 
net cash used by financing activities was million in fiscal compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million in fiscal this decrease in cash used by financing activities was primarily a result of a reduction of share repurchase costs of million from fiscal and a million reduction in cash dividends paid from the prior fiscal year 
we hold a variety of interest bearing ars consisting of federally insured student loan backed securities and insured municipal authority bonds 
as of july   our ars portfolio totaled approximately million  net of a temporary impairment charge of million  classified as available for sale securities 
these ars investments are intended to provide liquidity via an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined calendar intervals  allowing investors to either roll over their holdings or gain immediate liquidity by selling such interests at par 
the uncertainties in the credit markets that began in february have affected our holdings in ars investments and auctions for our investments in these securities have failed to settle on their respective settlement dates 
historically the fair value of ars investments had approximated par value due to the frequent resets through the auction process 
while we continue to earn interest on our ars investments at the maximum contractual rate  these investments are not currently trading and therefore do not currently have a readily determinable market value 
accordingly  the estimated fair value of ars no longer approximates par value 
consequently  the investments are not currently liquid  and we will not be able to access these funds until a future auction of these investments is successful  the issuer redeems the securities  or at maturity 
maturity dates for these ars investments range from to with principal distributions occurring on certain securities prior to maturity 
we also hold short term available for sale securities totaling million at july  that consist of treasury bills and certificates of deposit 
in october  our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to million of our common stock 
we may  from time to time  as business conditions warrant  purchase stock in the open market or through private transactions 
purchases may be increased  decreased or discontinued at any time without prior notice 
the plan does not obligate us to repurchase any specific number of shares and may be suspended at any time at management s discretion 
during fiscal  we repurchased  shares at an average price per share of for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
we have repurchased the full authorization of million of shares  but may repurchase additional shares in the future 
we believe that our cash on hand  together with our cash flows from operations  will be sufficient to meet our capital and operating requirements for at least the next twelve months 
our future capital requirements  however  will depend on numerous factors  including without limitation  liquidity of our auction rate securities  the size and number of new and expanded stores and or store concepts  investment costs for management information systems  potential acquisitions and or joint ventures  repurchase of stock and future results of operations 
summary disclosures about contractual obligations and commitments the following tables summarize our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of july  in thousands amount of commitment expiration period total less than year years years after years operating leases trade letters of credit unconditional purchase obligations total contractual obligations and commitments unconditional purchase obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
included in the purchase obligations category above are commitments for inventory purchases  capital expenditures  information technology and professional services 
most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty and with short notice  usually to days 
we excluded amounts reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as accounts payable and accrued liabilities from the table above 
the table above does not include liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits 
as we are unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of such liabilities  the table does not include million of income tax  interest and penalties relating to unrecognized tax benefits that are recorded as noncurrent liabilities within our consolidated balance sheet as of july  inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on the results of operations in the recent past 
however  we cannot assure that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
for example  cotton prices have risen substantially since the beginning of fiscal  should this rise continue in fiscal  there will be pressure on our average unit costs and our gross margins will continue to be impacted 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks  which include changes in us interest rates and  to a lesser extent  foreign exchange rates 
we do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk we currently maintain a portfolio of variable interest rate investments consisting of cash equivalents  short term marketable securities and long term investments consisting of ars 
according to our investment policy  we may invest in taxable and tax exempt instruments 
in addition  the policy establishes limits on credit quality  maturity  issuer and type of instrument 
marketable securities are classified as trading or available for sale 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents 
investments are considered short term available for sale securities if the original maturity is between three months and twelve months  or long term investments if the original maturity is greater than twelve months 
historically the fair value of ars investments had approximated par value due to the frequent resets through the auction process 
while we continue to earn interest on our ars investments at the maximum contractual rate  these investments are not currently trading and therefore do not currently have a readily determinable market value 
accordingly  the estimated fair value of ars no longer approximates par value 
we determined the estimated fair value of our investment in ars as of july  using a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of our investments in ars 
the assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates for interest rates  timing and amount of cash flows and expected holding periods of the ars 
we have modified our investment strategy and increased our investments in more liquid money market investments 
the following table lists our cash equivalents  short term marketable securities and long term marketable securities at july  fair value dollars in thousands cash equivalents weighted average interest rate short term available for sale securities weighted average interest rate long term available for sale securities weighted average interest rate total the interest payable on our bank line of credit is based on variable interest rates and therefore affected by changes in market interest rates 
if interest rates rose significantly  our results from operations and cash flows would not be materially affected since we have no outstanding borrowings 
foreign currency risks we enter into a significant amount of purchase obligations outside of the united states  substantially all of which are negotiated and settled in us dollars 
fluctuations in exchange rates can impact our financial condition and results of operations 
we also operate a subsidiary for which the functional currency is the canadian dollar 
assets and liabilities of canada s operations are translated into us dollars at year end rates  while income and expenses are translated at the weighted average exchange rates for the year 
the related translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of shareholders equity 
intercompany settlements are recorded in other income expense at the weighted average exchange rate for the year 
we do not hedge against foreign currency risks and believe that foreign currency exchange risk is immaterial
