item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the company owns regional aircraft and engines  which are typically leased to customers under triple net operating leases 
the company defines an operating lease as a lease with a term that is less than the useful life of the asset 
a triple net operating lease is an operating lease under which  in addition to monthly rental payments  the lessee is generally responsible for the taxes  insurance and maintenance and repair of the aircraft arising from the use and operation of the aircraft during the term of the lease 
the acquisition of such equipment is generally made using debt financing 
the company s profitability and cash flow are dependent in large part upon its ability to acquire equipment  obtain and maintain favorable lease rates on such equipment  and re lease or sell equipment that comes off lease 
the company is subject to the credit risk of its lessees  both as to collection of rental payments and as to performance by lessees of their obligations to maintain the equipment 
since lease rates for assets in the company s portfolio generally decline as the assets age  the company s ability to maintain revenue and earnings is primarily dependent upon the company s ability to acquire and lease additional assets 
the company s principal cash expenditures are for management fees  maintenance expense  interest payments  professional fees  insurance and principal payments of the subordinated notes pursuant to an amortization schedule 
the most significant non cash expenses include aircraft and engine depreciation and  in some years  impairment provisions  which are affected by significant estimates  and amortization of costs associated with the company s subordinated notes  which is included in interest expense 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or the company adjusts these estimates in future periods  the company s operating results and financial position could be materially affected 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that the most critical accounting policies include the following aircraft capitalization and depreciation  impairment of long lived assets  maintenance reserves and accrued costs  accounting for income taxes  and revenue recognition  accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts 
a 
aircraft capitalization and depreciation the company s interests in aircraft and aircraft engines are recorded at cost  which includes acquisition costs 
since inception  the company has purchased only used aircraft and aircraft engines 
it is the company s policy to hold aircraft for approximately twelve years unless market conditions dictate otherwise 
therefore  depreciation on aircraft is initially computed using the straight line method over the twelve year period to an estimated residual value based on appraisal 
the company estimates the period over which it will hold aircraft engines based upon estimated usage  repair costs and other factors  and depreciates them to their appraised residual value over such period using the straight line method 
the amount of the depreciation expense recognized by the company during any accounting period with respect to a particular asset depends upon the estimated holding period over which such asset is depreciated 
the company periodically reviews plans for lease or sale of its aircraft and aircraft engines and changes  as appropriate  the remaining expected holding period for such assets 
estimated residual values are reviewed and adjusted periodically  based upon updated appraised residual estimates and the expected holding periods 
decreases in the market value of aircraft could affect not only the current value  discussed above  but also the estimated residual value 
a reduction in the estimated residual value of an asset results in an increase in the amount of depreciation expense recognized by the company during the remaining holding period of the asset 
b 
impairment of long lived assets the company reviews assets for impairment when there has been an event or a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying amount of a long lived asset may not be recoverable 
in addition  the company routinely reviews all assets for impairment annually 
recoverability of an asset is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to the future estimated undiscounted cash flows without interest charges that the asset is expected to generate 
estimates are based on currently available market data and independent appraisals and are subject to fluctuation from time to time 
if these estimated cash flows are less than the carrying value of an asset at the time of evaluation  any impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
fair value is determined by reference to independent appraisals and other factors considered relevant by management 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasting of future operating results that are used in the preparation of futures estimated undiscounted cash flows and  if different conditions prevail in the future  material write downs may occur 
no impairment provision was recorded in or c 
maintenance reserves and accrued costs maintenance costs under the company s triple net operating leases are typically the responsibility of the lessees  and the majority of the company s leases require the payment of monthly maintenance reserves 
maintenance reserves and accrued costs in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets include i refundable maintenance payments billed to lessees  which are paid out as related maintenance is performed or at the end of the lease  ii for lessees that pay non refundable maintenance reserves  estimated maintenance costs accrued at the time a reimbursement claim or sufficient information is received regarding maintenance work performed  and iii maintenance for work performed for off lease aircraft  which is not related to the release of reserves received from lessees 
non refundable maintenance reserves are reflected as revenue based on reported usage  if collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company uses the direct expense method  under which maintenance costs are expensed as incurred 
maintenance reserves are set by mutual agreement of the company and its lessee at inception of the lease and are based on the company estimate of the total maintenance cost at some future point resulting from the lessee s usage 
reserve rates are typically subject to an annual adjustment provision that accounts for inflation of maintenance costs 
if a lessee is required to repair a component during the lease or perform a repair at lease end in order to comply with aircraft return conditions  it will be entitled to collect the reserves related to that repair from the company  and any excess costs would then be the responsibility of the lessee 
therefore  if maintenance rates do not accurately reflect the true cost of a repair  the company will not incur any financial impact 
if  however  the company repossesses an aircraft upon a lessee default  the company would incur expense for the entire cost of the maintenance 
if maintenance rates under a defaulted lease inaccurately reflect the costs of the lessee usage  such costs would be in excess of collected reserves 
it is also possible that  in order to remarket a repossessed aircraft  certain inspections and repairs may need to be performed earlier than otherwise required by the manufacturer or regulatory specifications 
in such a case  the collected reserves from the defaulted lessee  which were established assuming a normal interval between repairs  would likely be insufficient to cover the total cost incurred by the company 
in and  several aircraft were returned to the company prior to their respective lease expirations 
the company incurred significant maintenance expense as a result of the returns  and  in some cases  the maintenance reserves retained by the company at the time of the returns were insufficient to cover the required maintenance 
d 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing the company s consolidated financial statements  management is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which the company operates 
this process involves estimating the company s current tax exposure under the most recent tax laws and assessing temporary and permanent differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated balance sheet 
management must also assess the likelihood that the company s deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and  to the extent management believes it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized  the company must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent the company establishes a valuation allowance or changes the allowance in a period  the company reflects the corresponding increase or decrease in the tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations 
as discussed in notes and to the consolidated financial statements  the company measures and discloses the amount of its unrecognized tax positions 
the company had no valuation allowances or material unrecognized tax positions in or significant management judgment is required in estimating the company s future taxable income for purposes of assessing the company s ability to realize any benefit from its deferred taxes 
if actual taxable income is less than these estimates or if the company adjusts its estimates of future taxable income  the company may not realize any benefit from its deferred tax assets and its operating results and financial condition could be materially affected 
e 
revenue recognition  accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts revenue from leasing of aircraft assets is recognized as operating lease revenue on a straight line basis over the terms of the applicable lease agreements 
deferred rent is recorded when the cash rent received is lower than the straight line revenue recognized 
such receivables decrease over the term of the applicable leases 
non refundable maintenance reserves billed to lessees are accrued as maintenance reserves revenue based on aircraft usage 
in instances where collectibility is not reasonably assured  the company recognizes revenue as cash payments are received 
the company estimates and charges to income a provision for bad debts based on its experience in the business and with each specific customer  the level of past due accounts  and its analysis of the lessee s overall financial condition 
if the financial condition of the company s customers deteriorates  it could result in actual losses exceeding the estimated allowances 
during  due to uncertainty about the collectibility of the related receivables  the company recorded  of bad debt expense related to maintenance paid on behalf of a lessee 
in  the company recorded bad debt expense of  and reduced maintenance reserves revenue by  to reserve against amounts due from two lessees with which the company had previously agreed to defer a portion of rent and reserves payments due during the company also recorded bad debt expense of  in in connection with the return of an aircraft 
results of operations the company s net income decreased by  in compared to  due primarily to decreased operating lease revenue and increased maintenance expense  the aggregate effect of which was partially offset by increased maintenance reserves revenue and decreased interest expense 
operating lease revenue decreased by  in compared to  primarily because of a  decrease in revenue related to aircraft that were off lease for all or part of  a  decrease related to assets that were re leased in at lower rates  and a  decrease due to uncertainty about the collectibility of certain receivables 
the effects of these reductions were partially offset by a  increase in revenue related to aircraft engines purchased in the second half of and a  increase related to aircraft that were on lease in  but were off lease in the period 
maintenance reserves revenue increased by  in compared to the period included maintenance reserves revenue of  related to refundable maintenance reserves retained by the company when two aircraft were repossessed in early such funds have been used for maintenance required by the return conditions of the leases 
during  the company recorded a  reduction in maintenance reserves revenue due to uncertainty about the collectibility of the related receivables 
other income increased by  in compared to  primarily because the period included a net gain on insurance proceeds that the company received for one of its dhc aircraft that had sustained significant damage in january  as well as the sale of spare parts and an engine that was replaced on another of the company s dhc aircraft 
the period included interest on a federal tax refund  as well as a gain on expected insurance proceeds for damage to the company s spare saab a aircraft engine 
the company recognized  more in maintenance expense in than in the period included an increase in maintenance performed on aircraft that were returned to the company during the year  which was funded primarily by reserves previously collected by the company 
this increase was partially offset by a year to year decrease in maintenance performed by lessees using non refundable reserves and a decrease in maintenance performed on other off lease aircraft 
during and   and  respectively  of the company s maintenance expense was funded by non refundable maintenance reserves that had been recorded as revenue when earned 
in  two customers  which leased two fokker and three fokker aircraft  experienced severe financial difficulties and returned the five aircraft to the company 
one of the customers was a significant customer based on lease revenue 
the company retained all maintenance reserves  totaling  which were previously recorded as maintenance reserves revenue 
the company has incurred and will continue to incur significant maintenance costs in order to prepare the five aircraft for lease to new customers 
approximately  of such costs was incurred in the two customers referenced above were two of four customers with which the company agreed to defer a portion of the rent and maintenance reserves due during and during  the company wrote off receivables  totaling approximately  owed by both customers at the time the aircraft were returned 
such write offs resulted in reductions to the company s operating lease revenue  maintenance reserves revenue and other income of   and  respectively 
interest expense decreased by  in compared to  primarily as a result of a lower average subordinated notes balance and lower discount amortization  as well as the expiration of the company s interest rate swap in december the effects of these decreases were partially offset by an increase in the applicable libor rate from year to year 
in addition  the interest rate margin and fee amortization related to the company s new credit facility were higher than under the former credit facility 
professional fees and general and administrative expenses increased by  in  compared to  primarily because of legal expense incurred in in connection with the repossession of five aircraft 
insurance expense increased by  in  compared to  because more aircraft were off lease in the company s effective tax rate was approximately in the years ended december  and liquidity and capital resources the company is currently financing its assets primarily through debt borrowings and excess cash flows 
a former credit facility and new credit facility during  under the former credit facility and new credit facility in the aggregate  the company borrowed  and repaid  of the outstanding principal 
as of december   and december   the company was in compliance with all covenants under the new credit facility and former credit facility agreements  respectively 
on april   the former credit facility expired after two short term extensions  and the company entered into the new credit facility 
the company used its initial borrowing under the new credit facility  which has a two year term  to pay off the outstanding balance of  due under the former credit facility at that time 
as with the former credit facility  the new credit facility is secured by all of the assets of the company  including its aircraft and engine portfolio 
the new credit facility is expandable on the addition of new participating lenders or increased participation by existing lenders to  it has a two year term and provides for borrowing up to an amount equal to of the value of the eligible collateral that secures the credit facility 
assets that are off lease in excess of four months or under lease but with payments in arrears by more than days are excluded from the collateral base 
the facility requires payments of interest only which floats at a rate equal to either libor or the prime rate  plus a margin of 
the credit facility agreement requires the company to maintain compliance with certain financial covenants related to i total debt to net worth  ii interest to net income  iii income to debt service  iv minimum tangible net worth  and v net losses 
any failure to maintain compliance with such covenants is deemed a default under the agreement 
as of march   the company had an outstanding balance of  under the new credit facility 
although the total maximum available credit under the new credit facility is  exclusion of certain aircraft  primarily off lease  from the collateral base has decreased the maximum available credit to  at that date 
the company is currently in compliance with all covenants of its new credit facility  and based on its current projections  the company believes it will continue to be in compliance with those covenants  but there can be no assurance of future compliance 
the company interest expense in connection with the new credit facility will generally increase and decrease with prevailing interest rates 
the company s new credit facility has a fixed interest rate margin that is higher than the highest variable margin that was applicable to the company s former credit facility  but the company does not anticipate that the higher margin will have a significant impact on the company s results 
the company has the ability to enter into interest rate swaps to economically hedge against interest rate increases in its floating rate debt under the new credit facility and has done so in the past with respect to debt owed under the former credit facility 
see note to the company s financial statements and paragraph b below 
b derivative instrument in december  the company entered into a two year interest rate swap the swap with a notional amount of million  under which it committed to make or receive a net settlement for the difference in interest receivable computed monthly on the basis of day libor and interest payable monthly on the basis of a fixed rate of per annum 
the company entered into the swap with the objective of economically converting a portion of its floating rate debt into a fixed rate for the term of the swap  thereby reducing the volatility of cash flow associated with its debt obligations 
the swap expired on december  and  therefore  had no value on or after that date 
gains and losses on the swap were recorded as a component of interest expense 
the company recorded a gain on the swap of  for the year ended december  the company also recognized additional interest expense on the net settlement of the swap of  in for gaap purposes  fair value measurements can be made using several valuation techniques  such as the market approach comparable market prices  the income approach present value of future income or cash flow  and the cost approach cost to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement cost 
gaap utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels 
the following is a brief description of those three levels level observable inputs such as quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level inputs  other than quoted prices  that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly 
these include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active 
level unobservable inputs that reflect the reporting entity s own assumptions 
the swap agreement effectively converted million of the company s short term variable rate debt to a fixed rate 
under this agreement  the company paid a fixed rate and received a variable rate of libor 
the fair value of this interest rate derivative was based on quoted prices for similar instruments from a commercial bank and  therefore  the interest rate derivative was considered a level input 
c senior unsecured subordinated debt in april  the company entered into a securities purchase agreement the subordinated notes agreement  whereby the company would issue subordinated notes  with an aggregate principal amount of million to certain note purchasers 
in july  the company and the holders of subordinated notes agreed to amend the subordinated notes agreement to reduce the maximum amount of subordinated notes to be issued from million to million 
the final maturity is december  principal payments which fully amortize the balance of the subordinated notes were due beginning april  through december  in amounts necessary to cause i the balance of the subordinated notes and ii the ratio of total outstanding debt under the credit facility and subordinated notes compared to the discounted portfolio value to not exceed amounts specified in the subordinated notes agreement 
the subordinated notes purchasers hold warrants to purchase up to  shares of the company common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the warrants are exercisable for a four year period after the earliest of i a change of control  or ii the final maturity of the related subordinated notes 
pursuant to an investors rights agreement  the warrants are subject to registration rights that require the company to use commercially reasonable efforts to register the shares issued upon exercise of the warrants on a registration statement filed with the sec 
during and  the company repaid  and  of principal under the subordinated notes  respectively 
the company was in compliance with all covenants under the subordinated notes agreement as of december  and d special purpose financing in march  the company repaid the outstanding principal owed by its subsidiary  aerocentury vi llc  under its special purpose financing which was used to finance one aircraft 
at the same time  the company transferred ownership of the aircraft that served as collateral for the financing from aerocentury vi llc to aerocentury corp 
aerocentury vi llc was dissolved in september e cash flow the company primary sources of cash are operating lease revenue and maintenance reserves billed monthly to lessees based on aircraft usage 
maintenance reserves collected by the company are not required by the leases to be segregated and are included in cash and cash equivalents on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
the company s primary uses of cash are for servicing principal and interest payments due under its debt obligations  maintenance expense  management fees  professional fees  and insurance 
debt repayment obligations increased in april  when the subordinated notes debt repayment schedule began to require repayment of principal in addition to interest 
the amount of interest paid by the company depends on the outstanding balances of its subordinated notes debt  which bears a fixed interest rate  and its credit facilities  which carried or carry a floating interest rate as well as an interest rate margin 
the interest rate margin is higher under the new credit facility than under the former credit facility  and the amount of interest owed under both facilities was and will continue to depend on changes in prevailing interest rates 
the timing and amount of the company s payments for maintenance vary  depending on the timing of lessee performed maintenance which is eligible for reimbursement  the aggregate amount of such claims and the timing and amount of maintenance incurred in connection with preparation of off lease aircraft for re lease to new customers 
the company s maintenance payments constitute a large portion of its cash needs  and the company may from time to time borrow additional funds under the new credit facility to provide funding for such payments 
management believes that the company will have adequate cash flow to meet its ongoing operational needs  including required repayments under the new credit facility and subordinated notes  based upon its estimates of future revenues and expenditures  which include assumptions regarding i revenues for assets to be re leased  ii timely use of proceeds of unused debt capacity toward additional acquisitions of income producing assets  iii required debt payments  iv interest rates  and v the cost and anticipated timing of maintenance to be performed 
although the company believes that the assumptions it has made in forecasting its cash flow are reasonable in light of experience  actual results could deviate from such assumptions 
among the more significant factors outside the company s control that could have an impact on the accuracy of cash flow assumptions are i lessee non performance or non compliance with lease obligations  including obligations under deferral agreements as discussed in outlook  below  which may affect the new credit facility collateral limitations and covenants  subordinated notes covenants  and revenue and expenses  ii an increase in interest rates that negatively affects the company s profitability and causes the company to violate covenants of the new credit facility agreement or the subordinated notes agreement  which may in turn require repayment of some or all of the amounts outstanding under the new credit facility or the subordinated notes  iii inability to locate and acquire a sufficient volume of additional aircraft assets at prices that will produce acceptable net returns  iv lessee performance of maintenance earlier than anticipated  and v inability to locate new lessees for returned equipment within a reasonable remarketing period  or at a rent level consistent with projected rental rates for the asset 
i operating activities the company s cash flow from operations decreased by  from to as discussed below  the change in cash flow was primarily a result of an increase in expenditures for maintenance  decreases in payments received for rent and maintenance reserves  and a tax refund received in the prior year  the effects of which were partially offset by an increase in payments received for security deposits in as discussed in outlook below  it is likely that the company s operating lease revenue will be lower in than in the company incurred significant maintenance expense in to prepare certain aircraft for re lease 
it is likely that the company will continue to incur significant maintenance expense in to prepare some of those aircraft for re lease  but the company currently anticipates that the amount of such maintenance will be lower in than in operating lease revenue  maintenance reserves revenue and security deposits several aircraft that were on lease in were off lease for all or part of as a result  payments received from lessees for rent and maintenance reserves decreased by  and  respectively  in compared to in addition  the company did not receive payment of a portion of the rent and maintenance reserves due in from two customers when five aircraft were returned early 
as a result  the company wrote off the related receivables 
the company currently is receiving no lease revenue for its off lease assets  comprised of four fokker  three fokker  one bombardier dash q and one saab b aircraft  and for a fokker aircraft for which a lease has been signed and for which delivery to the customer is expected to occur in the second quarter of in february  the company signed a term sheet with and subsequently received a deposit from a regional carrier in the country of georgia for a three year lease of one of the four fokker aircraft  with delivery to the customer expected to occur in the second quarter of the company also signed a term sheet and subsequently received a deposit from a regional carrier in africa for a four year lease of the bombardier dash q aircraft 
delivery of the aircraft is expected to occur in april the company received  more for security deposits during than in the increase was primarily due to funds received when the company drew on a letter of credit that served as security for two aircraft leases that were terminated early in as a result of the lessee s bankruptcy 
the security deposit was used to partially fund maintenance required by the return conditions of the leases 
payments for maintenance payments for maintenance increased by  in  compared to  as a result of payments related to off lease aircraft 
the majority of the company s maintenance expenditures during were related to two aircraft that were returned in early  the maintenance for which was partially funded by security deposits  including a letter of credit  received from the previous lessee 
the amount of payments for maintenance in future periods will depend on the amount and timing of maintenance paid as reimbursement to lessees for maintenance reserves claims  which are dependent upon utilization and required maintenance intervals  and maintenance paid for off lease aircraft 
income taxes during  the company paid taxes of  during the company paid taxes of  and received  of federal tax refunds 
ii investing activities during  the company received cash of  from the collection of insurance proceeds for i an aircraft that was damaged and declared a total loss in january and ii an engine that was damaged in late during  the company used cash of  for the purchase of an aircraft  equipment that has been or will be installed on several aircraft and for acquisition costs related to an aircraft engine purchased in december  as well as a deposit for an aircraft that the company expects to purchase in during  the company used cash of  for asset purchases and capital equipment installed on aircraft 
in june and july  the company executed letters of intent related to the company s proposed purchase of two bombardier dash q aircraft for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
the company purchased the first aircraft in december and  in march  signed a term sheet and received a deposit for a four year lease of the aircraft 
the company is currently negotiating for the purchase of the second aircraft 
iii financing activities the company borrowed  and  under the former credit facility and new credit facility during and  respectively 
the company repaid  and  of its total outstanding debt in and  respectively 
such payments were funded by excess cash flow 
outlook a general the ongoing global economic downturn and slow rate of recovery from the recent recession resulted in a significant reduction in airline passenger volume and in reaction to that  a reduction in the number of aircraft needed for operation by carriers in nearly all geographic areas 
this capacity reduction has created a challenging environment for the company in three respects the reduction in the demand for aircraft has increased the possibility that the company s current lessees will choose to return leased aircraft at lease expiration rather than renew the existing leases  notwithstanding that any such lessee may incur significant expenses to satisfy return conditions 
unless they are renewed  leases for two and six of the company s assets will expire in the first and second halves of  respectively 
the lessee for one of the aircraft with a lease expiring in the first half of has indicated that it will extend the lease 
as discussed below  the company s primary focus is extending current leases and remarketing aircraft that have been or are returned 
due to decreased demand for aircraft capacity  it is likely that the company will experience lower on lease utilization rates and that the company will experience longer lead times for remarketing of returned aircraft  as well as lower rental rates for remarketed aircraft  as was the case with several lease extensions and re leases during such factors will likely result in lower operating lease revenue in the global economic situation has also increased the possibility of an unanticipated lessee default  particularly by the company s less established carriers  due to such lessee s business failure 
a lessee s default and the unscheduled return of an aircraft to the company for remarketing could result not only in reduced operating lease revenue but also in unanticipated  unrecoverable expenses arising from the lessee s default on its maintenance and return condition obligations 
the company s operating lease revenue was significantly lower in than in  primarily as a result of aircraft that were returned to the company during the company also incurred significant amounts of maintenance expense in and  as discussed below  expects significant expense when the maintenance work is completed in although the company does not anticipate early returns of aircraft in  the company monitors the performance of all of its customers and continues to note indications of weakened financial conditions and operating results for several of its customers 
finally  the downturn also has created fewer opportunities for acquisitions for the company 
the company s customers are generally carriers needing additional aircraft to expand their route systems or increase frequencies 
in the current environment of reduced demand for air travel and consequently reduced capacity by carriers  there is likely to be a significant decrease in the pool of such customers requiring aircraft 
therefore  it is possible that the company s portfolio growth will continue to be slow  as fewer carriers seek to expand their fleets 
b remarketing efforts six fokker and three fokker aircraft were returned to the company in the company has incurred and will continue to incur significant maintenance costs in order to prepare the aircraft for lease to new customers 
the company estimates that the balance of such costs is approximately  and will likely be incurred in the first half of  resulting in significant maintenance expense in that period 
although the company believes that the reserves received during the term of the leases and retained at the time the aircraft were returned will be sufficient to fund such maintenance  it is possible that the maintenance costs will exceed the amount of the retained reserves 
in february  the company delivered a fokker aircraft to a regional carrier in asia  the lease for which had been signed in december in february  the company signed a three year lease for another of its off lease fokker aircraft with the same customer in asia 
the company also signed a term sheet and received a deposit from a second customer in asia for a three year lease of another fokker aircraft 
the company expects to deliver both aircraft in the second quarter of in march  the company signed a term sheet and received a deposit from a regional carrier in africa for a four year lease of a bombardier dash q aircraft that had been purchased in december delivery of the aircraft is expected to occur in april the company is negotiating the lease of one of its three fokker aircraft that were off lease at december  in march  the company agreed to a month lease extension for a dash aircraft  the lease for which was to expire in march 
the lessee for that aircraft has indicated that it will also extend the lease for a second dash aircraft  which is subject to a lease expiring in may the company is seeking lessees for its remaining off lease assets  comprised of three fokker and two fokker aircraft that were off lease at december  and one saab b aircraft that was returned under the lease terms in march c new credit facility as of march   the amount available to the company under the new credit facility  after exclusion of certain aircraft  was approximately  as discussed below in d deferral agreements  the company has one outstanding deferral agreement for rent and maintenance reserves owed to the company with the lessee of two fokker aircraft 
currently  the lessee is more than days overdue in its obligations to the company  and the two fokker aircraft are excluded from the collateral base under the new credit facility 
if the other aircraft that are currently off lease are not re leased in the time period currently anticipated by the company  and if the lessee does not become current in its obligations to the company  the company would likely have to make a principal payment under the new credit facility  for which the company might not have sufficient immediately available funds 
d deferral agreements during  the company signed deferral agreements with four customers 
pursuant to the terms of the agreements  one deferral was fully paid in and one was fully paid in pursuant to the terms of the agreements 
during  the company signed additional deferral agreements with three of the four customers that had deferral agreements in during  two of the customers returned aircraft to the company prior to lease end  and the company wrote off receivables  totaling approximately  owed by both customers at the time the aircraft were returned 
such write offs resulted in reductions to the company s operating lease revenue  maintenance reserves revenue and other income of   and  respectively 
the company currently has only one deferral balance outstanding  with a customer that leases two fokker aircraft and was a significant customer in based on operating lease revenue 
because two of the company s customers that had deferral agreements are no longer customers of the company  the company does not believe that  based on its evaluation of its current customers and historical experience  that the four deferral agreements that were signed in and represent a trend that will result in additional deferral agreements in factors that may affect future results general economic conditions and lowered demand for travel 
the company s business is dependent upon general economic conditions and the strength of the travel and transportation industry 
the industry is in a period of financial difficulty and contraction due to the protracted downturn in the global economy 
passenger volume has fallen significantly for carriers worldwide  and the loss of revenue has affected many carriers financial condition 
the ongoing credit crisis has made it difficult or impossible for many regional carriers to find the additional debt financing on which they have traditionally relied 
the confluence of these economic factors increases the likelihood of failures among the company s customers 
the spread of another flu epidemic  the threat or execution of a terrorist attack against aviation  a natural event that interrupts air traffic  such as the iceland volcano eruption  political crises or other events that cause a prolonged spike in fuel prices  or other like events could exacerbate an already weakened condition and lead to widespread failures in the air carrier industries 
if lessees experience financial difficulties and are unable to meet lease obligations  this will  in turn  negatively affect the company s financial performance 
during periods of economic contraction  carriers generally reduce capacity in response to lower passenger loads  and as a result  there is a reduced demand for aircraft and a corresponding decrease in market lease rental rates and aircraft values 
this reduced market value for aircraft could affect the company s results if the market value of an asset or assets in the company s portfolio falls below carrying value  and the company determines that a write down of the value on the company s balance sheet is appropriate 
furthermore  if  as older leases expire  they are replaced by lease renewals or re leases at decreased lease rates  the lease revenue from the company s existing portfolio is likely to decline  with the magnitude of the decline dependent on the length of the downturn and the depth of the decline in market rents 
economic downturns can affect certain regions of the world more than others 
as the company s portfolio is not entirely globally diversified  a localized downturn in one of the key regions in which the company leases aircraft could have a significant adverse impact on the company 
currently  the largest proportion of the company s business by revenue comes from the european and caribbean regions  in which seven and two  respectively  of the company s lessees operate assets 
the european and caribbean regions constitute and  respectively  of the company s lease revenue 
several of the company customers have experienced financial difficulties arising from a combination of the weakened air carrier market and their own unique financial circumstances and have requested and been granted deferral of certain overdue and or future rental or reserve payment obligations as disclosed in the section entitled outlook d deferral agreements 
if the current weakened air carrier environment continues  it is possible that the company may enter into additional deferral agreements 
when a customer requests a deferral of lease obligations  the company evaluates the lessee s financial plan  the likelihood that the lessee can remain a viable carrier  and whether the deferral will be repaid according to the agreed schedule 
if the company feels that there is a risk that deferred obligations will not be repaid  the company does not record the deferred rent and reserve payments and instead records an allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the company makes a judgment that the lessee is likely to meet its deferred obligations  the company continues to record the deferred rental and reserve payments as revenue in the periods in which they accrue 
it is possible that a lessee that the company judges to be likely to repay its deferred obligations could experience a worsening financial condition 
in that circumstance  the company may determine that full repayment of the deferred obligations is no longer likely  in which case the company would record a bad debt expense or reduction of income 
this could have a material effect on the company financial results in the period that such bad debt expense or income reduction is recorded 
new credit facility obligations 
the company is obligated to make repayments of principal under the new credit facility in order to maintain certain debt ratios with respect to its assets in the collateral base 
assets that come off lease and remain off lease for a period of time  may reduce the collateral base  since the total amount of borrowing under the credit facility is limited to of the collateral base 
when past due lease payments exist for an asset  this may also affect its eligibility for inclusion in the collateral base  and the credit facility agreement places certain limits on the use of deferral agreements to cure such arrearages for purposes of inclusion of the subject asset in the collateral base 
the company believes it will have sufficient cash funds to make any payment that arises due to any such collateral base limitations 
the company s belief is based on certain assumptions regarding compliance of a major lessee with its lease and deferral agreement obligations  remarketing of off lease aircraft within the time period anticipated by the company  renewal of certain existing leases  interest rates  profitability  lessee defaults or bankruptcies  and certain other matters that the company deems reasonable in light of its experience in the industry see liquidity and capital resources cash flow  above 
there can be no assurance that the company s assumptions will prove to be correct 
if the assumptions are incorrect for example  if the company s off lease aircraft are not re leased in the time period currently anticipated by the company as described in outlook c new credit facility and the company has not obtained an applicable waiver or amendment of applicable covenants from its lenders to mitigate the situation  the company may have to sell a significant portion of its portfolio in order to avoid or cure a default under the new credit facility agreement 
ownership risks 
the company s portfolio is leased under operating leases 
the term of any such lease might be less than the entire anticipated remaining useful life of the leased asset 
the company s ability to recover its purchase investment in an asset subject to an operating lease is dependent upon the company s ability to profitably re lease or sell the asset after the expiration of the initial lease term 
some of the factors that have an impact on the company s ability to re lease or sell the asset include worldwide economic conditions  general aircraft market conditions  regulatory changes that may make an asset s use more expensive or preclude use unless the asset is modified  changes in the supply or cost of aircraft equipment and technological developments that cause the asset to become obsolete 
if the company is unable to remarket its assets on favorable terms when the operating leases for such equipment expire  the company s business  financial condition  cash flow  ability to service debt and results of operations could be adversely affected 
in addition  a successful investment in an asset subject to an operating lease depends in part upon having the asset returned by the lessee in the condition as required under the lease 
each lease typically obligates a customer to return an aircraft to the company in a specified condition  which generally requires the aircraft be returned in equal or better condition than at delivery to the lessee 
if the lessee becomes insolvent during the term of its lease and the company has to repossess the aircraft from the lessee  it is unlikely that the lessee will have the financial ability to meet these return obligations 
thus  upon repossession  the company may be required to expend funds in excess of the maintenance reserves collected from the insolvent lessee to return the aircraft to a remarketable condition 
several of the company s leases do not require payment of monthly maintenance reserves  which serve as the lessee s advance payment for its future repair and maintenance obligations 
if a repossession due to lessee default occurs under such a lease  the company will be left with the expense for the costs of unperformed repair and maintenance under the applicable lease and the company may incur an unanticipated expense in order to re lease the aircraft 
furthermore  the occurrence of unexpected adverse changes that impact the company s estimates of expected cash flows generated from an asset may result in an asset impairment charge against the company s earnings 
the company periodically reviews long term assets for impairment  in particular  when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of an asset is estimated to be not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
the company may be required to recognize asset impairment charges in the future as a result of a prolonged weak economic environment  challenging market conditions in the airline industry or events related to particular lessees  assets or asset types 
concentration of lessees and aircraft type 
for the month ended february   based on monthly revenue  the company s three largest customers were located in antigua  germany and norway and accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of the company s monthly lease revenue 
a lease default by or collection problem with one or a combination of any of these significant customers could have a disproportionate negative impact on the company s financial results and collateral base under the new credit facility  and  therefore  the company s operating results are especially sensitive to any negative developments with respect to these customers in terms of lease compliance or collection 
such concentration of lessee credit risk decreases as the company leases additional assets to new lessees 
as of february   the company owned seven fokker  eight bombardier dash and fourteen fokker aircraft  making these three aircraft types the dominant types in the portfolio and representing  and  respectively  of net book value 
as a result  a change in the desirability and availability of any of these types of aircraft  which would in turn affect valuations of such aircraft  would have a disproportionately significant impact on the company s portfolio value 
such aircraft type concentration will diminish if the company acquires additional assets of other types 
conversely  acquisition of these types of aircraft will increase the company s risks related to its concentration of those aircraft types 
lessee credit risk 
the company carefully evaluates the credit risk of each customer and attempts to obtain a third party guaranty  letters of credit or other credit enhancements  if it deems them necessary in addition to customary security deposits 
there is no assurance  however  that such enhancements will be available  or that  if obtained  will fully protect the company from losses resulting from a lessee default or bankruptcy 
if a lessee that is a certified us airline were in default under a lease and sought protection under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code  section of the bankruptcy code would automatically prevent the company from exercising any remedies against such lessee for a period of days 
after the day period had passed  the lessee would have to agree to perform the lease obligations and cure any defaults  or the company would have the right to repossess the equipment 
this procedure under the bankruptcy code has been subject to significant litigation  however  and it is possible that the company s enforcement rights may be further adversely affected by a declaration of bankruptcy by a defaulting lessee 
most of the company s current and expected growth is expected outside of the united states  and non us lessees are not subject to non us bankruptcy laws  although there may be debtor protection similar to us bankruptcy laws available in some jurisdictions 
in any event  collection and enforcement may be more difficult and complicated in foreign countries 
the company has seen indications of a weakening in both the financial condition and operating results of the majority of its customers 
the company closely monitors the performance of all of its lessees 
if any of the company current or future lessees becomes unable to meet their lease obligations  the company future results could be materially and adversely impacted 
risks related to regional air carriers 
the company s continued focus on its customer base of regional air carriers subjects the company to additional risks 
some of the lessees in the regional air carrier market are companies that are start up  low capital  and or low margin operators 
often  the success of such carriers depends on contractual arrangements with major trunk carriers or franchises from governmental agencies that provide subsidies for operating essential air routes  both of which may be subject to termination or cancellation with short notice periods 
because of this exposure  the company typically is able to obtain generally higher lease rates from these types of lessees 
availability of financing 
the company believes that the availability under the new credit facility will be sufficient to fund projected acquisitions through the end of in the longer term  however  the company s continued growth will depend on its ability to obtain capital  either through debt or equity financings 
the financial markets have experienced significant setbacks that have made access to capital more costly and difficult 
as a result  commercial lending origination has dramatically decreased  and asset based debt financing remains difficult to obtain 
the company will continue to seek additional lenders for participation in the new credit facility to increase the maximum amount available for borrowing under such facility to million and will continue to investigate other sources of debt financing 
there is no assurance that the company will succeed in finding such additional funding  and if such financing is found  it may be on terms less favorable than the company s current debt financings 
risks of debt financing 
the company s use of debt as the primary form of acquisition financing subjects the company to increased risks associated with leveraging 
indebtedness owed under the new credit facility and the subordinated notes carries a higher cost of capital relative to equity financing  resulting in relatively higher expense and reduced free cash flow 
debt financing is secured by the company s assets 
in addition to payment obligations  the new credit facility and subordinated notes also require the company to comply with certain financial covenants  including a requirement of positive earnings and compliance with interest coverage ratios and required net worth 
any default under the new credit facility  if not waived by the lenders  could result in foreclosure upon any or all of the existing assets of the company 
any such default could also result in a cross default under the subordinated notes 
investment in new aircraft types and engines 
the company intends to continue to focus solely on regional aircraft and engines 
although the company has traditionally invested in a limited number of types of turboprop aircraft and engines  the company has also acquired several fokker regional jet aircraft and regional jet aircraft engines  and may continue to seek acquisition opportunities for new types and models of regional jet and turboprop aircraft and engines used in the company targeted customer base of regional air carriers 
acquisition of aircraft types and engines not previously acquired by the company entails greater ownership risk due to the company lack of experience managing those aircraft and engine types 
the company believes  however  that the overall industry experience of jmc s personnel and its technical resources should permit the company to effectively manage such new aircraft types and engines 
further  the broadening of the asset types in the aircraft portfolio may have a benefit of diversifying the company portfolio see factors that may affect future results concentration of lessees and aircraft type  above 
warrant issuance 
as part of the subordinated notes financing  as revised upon the second and final closing in july  the holders of subordinated notes hold warrants to purchase up to  shares of the company s common stock  which represents of the post exercise fully diluted capitalization of the company as of the initial closing of the subordinated notes financing 
the exercise price under the warrants is per share 
if the warrants to purchase shares were exercised at a time when the exercise price is less than the fair market value of the company s common stock  there would be dilution to the existing holders of common stock 
this dilution of the company s common stock could depress its trading price 
leasing risks 
the company s successful negotiation of lease extensions  re leases and sales is critical to achieving its financial objectives and involves a number of risks 
demand for lease or purchase of the assets depends on the economic condition of the airline industry  which is  in turn  sensitive to general economic conditions 
the ability to re lease equipment at acceptable rates may depend on the demand and market values at the time of remarketing 
the company acquires used aircraft equipment 
the market for used aircraft equipment has been cyclical  and generally reflects economic conditions and the strength of the travel and transportation industry 
the demand for and value of many types of used aircraft in the recent past has been depressed by such factors as airline financial difficulties  increased fuel costs  the number of new aircraft on order and the number of aircraft coming off lease 
values may also increase for certain aircraft types that become desirable based on market conditions and changing airline capacity 
if the company were to purchase an aircraft during a period of increasing values  it would in turn need to lease such aircraft at a corresponding higher lease rate to compensate for its higher purchase price 
engine leasing risk 
the company currently has three engines in its portfolio  making up of the company s total aircraft and aircraft engines net book value 
the company may from time to time lease one or more of these engines under industry standard short term engine leases  which place the risk of an engine failure not caused by lessee negligence or foreign object damage upon the lessor 
it is not economically practicable for an engine lessor to insure against that risk 
if an engine failure occurs and is not covered by a manufacturer s warranty or caused by circumstances that under its lease the lessee is required to cover  the company s investment in the engine could be a significant loss 
interest rate risk 
the new credit facility carries a floating interest rate based upon short term interest rate indices 
lease rates typically  but not always  move over time with interest rates  but market demand and numerous other asset specific factors also affect lease rates 
because the company s typical lease rates are fixed at the origination of leases  interest rate changes during the term of a lease have no effect on existing lease rental payments 
therefore  if interest rates rise significantly and there is relatively little lease origination by the company following such rate increases  the company could experience decreased net income as additional interest expense outpaces revenue growth 
further  even if significant lease origination occurs following such rate increases  other contemporaneous aircraft market forces may result in lower or flat rental rates  and the company could also experience decreased net income 
international risks 
the company leases assets primarily in overseas markets 
leases with foreign lessees  however  may present different risks than those with domestic lessees 
foreign laws  regulations and judicial procedures may be more or less protective of lessor rights than those which apply in the united states 
the company could experience collection or repossession problems related to the enforcement of its lease agreements under foreign local laws and remedies in foreign jurisdictions 
the protections potentially offered by section of the bankruptcy code do not apply to non us carriers  and applicable local law may not offer similar protections 
certain countries do not have a central registration or recording system with which to locally establish the company s interest in equipment and related leases 
this could make it more difficult for the company to recover an aircraft in the event of a default by a foreign lessee 
a lease with a foreign lessee is subject to risks related to the economy of the country or region in which such lessee is located  which may be weaker than the us economy 
a foreign economic downturn may impact a foreign lessee s ability to make lease payments  even though the us and other economies remain stable 
in addition  foreign lessees are subject to risks related to currency conversion fluctuations 
although the company s current leases are all payable in us dollars  the company may agree in the future to leases that permit payment in foreign currency  which would subject such lease revenue to monetary risk due to currency fluctuations 
in addition  if the company undertakes certain obligations under a lease to contribute to a repair or improvement and if the work is performed in a foreign jurisdiction and paid for in foreign currency  currency fluctuations causing a weaker dollar between the time such agreement is made and the time payment for the work is made may result in an unanticipated increase in us dollar denominated cost for the company 
foreign lessees that operate internationally may also face restrictions on repatriating foreign revenue to their home country 
this could create a cash flow crisis for an otherwise profitable carrier  affecting its ability to meet its lease obligations 
even with us dollar denominated lease payment provisions  the company could still be affected by a devaluation of the lessee s local currency that would make it more difficult for a lessee to meet its us dollar denominated payments  increasing the risk of default of that lessee  particularly if its revenue is primarily derived in the local currency 
finally  ownership of a leased asset operating in a foreign country and or by a foreign carrier may subject the company to additional tax liabilities that are not present with aircraft operated in the united states 
depending on the jurisdiction  laws governing such tax liabilities may be complex  not well formed or not uniformly enforced 
in such jurisdictions  the company may decide to take an uncertain tax position based on the best advice of the local tax experts it engages  which position may be challenged by the taxing authority 
if the taxing authority later assesses a liability  the company may be required to pay penalties and interest on the assessed amount  which penalties and interest would not give rise to a corresponding foreign tax credit on the company s u 
s 
tax return 
reliance on jmc 
all management of the company is performed by jmc under a management agreement between the company and jmc  which is in the fourteenth year of a year term and provides for an asset based management fee 
jmc is not a fiduciary to the company or its stockholders 
the company s board of directors the board has ultimate control and supervisory responsibility over all aspects of the company and owes fiduciary duties to the company and its stockholders 
the board has no control over the internal operations of jmc  but the board does have the ability and responsibility to manage the company relationship with jmc and the performance of jmc obligations to the company under the management agreement  as it would have for any third party service provider to the company 
while jmc may not owe any fiduciary duties to the company by virtue of the management agreement  all of the officers of jmc are also officers of the company  and in that capacity owe fiduciary duties to the company and its stockholders 
in addition  certain officers of the company hold significant ownership positions in the company and jhc  the parent company of jmc 
the management agreement may be terminated if jmc defaults on its obligations to the company 
however  the agreement provides for liquidated damages in the event of its wrongful termination by the company 
all of the officers of jmc are also officers of the company  and certain directors of the company are also directors of jmc 
in addition  certain persons serving as officers of both the company and jmc hold significant ownership positions in both the company and jhc  the holding company for jmc 
consequently  the directors and officers of jmc may have a conflict of interest in the event of a dispute between the company and jmc 
although the company has taken steps to prevent conflicts of interest arising from such dual roles  such conflicts may still occur 
jmc has acted as the management company for two other aircraft portfolio owners  jetfleet iii  which raised approximately  in bond issuance proceeds  and aerocentury iv  inc aerocentury iv  which raised approximately  in bond issuance proceeds 
in the first quarter of  aerocentury iv defaulted on certain bond obligations 
in june  the indenture trustee for aerocentury iv s bondholders repossessed aerocentury iv s assets and took over management of aerocentury iv s remaining assets 
jetfleet iii defaulted on its bond obligation of  in may the indenture trustee for jetfleet iii bondholders repossessed jetfleet iii s unsold assets in late may management fee structure 
all decisions regarding acquisitions and disposal of aircraft from the company s portfolio are made by jmc 
jmc is paid a management fee based on the net asset value of the company s portfolio 
it also receives a one time asset acquisition fee upon purchase of an aircraft by the company  and a one time sale fee upon disposal of an aircraft 
optimization of the results of the company depends on timing of the acquisition  lease yield on the acquired assets  and re lease or sale of its portfolio assets 
under the current management fee structure  a larger volume of acquisitions generates acquisition fees and also increases the periodic management fee by increasing the size of the aircraft portfolio 
since the company s current business strategy involves continued growth of its portfolio and a buy and hold strategy  a compensation structure that results in greater compensation with an increased portfolio size is not inherently inconsistent with that strategy 
the compensation structure does  nonetheless  create a situation where a decision by jmc for the company to forego an asset transaction deemed to be an unacceptable business risk due to the lessee or the aircraft type is in conflict with jmc own pecuniary interest 
as a result  the compensation structure could act to incent greater risk taking by jmc in asset acquisition decision making 
all acquisition decisions by jmc on behalf of the company  however  currently require new credit facility lender approval of the asset acquired and the lessee in order to be included in the new credit facility collateral base  and the company has established objective target guidelines for yields on acquired assets 
further  any acquisition that involves a new asset type must be approved by the board of the company  including the outside independent directors 
while the company currently believes the foregoing are effective mitigating factors against undue compensation incented risk taking by jmc  there is no assurance that such mechanisms can entirely and effectively eliminate such risk 
government regulation 
there are a number of areas in which government regulation may result in costs to the company 
these include aircraft registration  safety requirements  required equipment modifications and aircraft noise requirements 
although it is contemplated that the burden and cost of complying with such requirements will fall primarily upon lessees of equipment  there can be no assurance that the cost will not fall on the company 
furthermore  future government regulations could cause the value of any non complying equipment owned by the company to decline substantially 
competition 
the aircraft leasing industry is highly competitive 
the company competes with aircraft manufacturers  distributors  airlines and other operators  equipment managers  leasing companies  equipment leasing programs  financial institutions and other parties engaged in leasing  managing or remarketing aircraft  many of which have significantly greater financial resources 
nevertheless  the company believes that it is competitive because of jmc s experience and operational efficiency in identifying and obtaining financing for the transaction types desired by regional air carriers 
this market segment  which is characterized by transaction sizes of less than million and in many cases privately held customers without well established third party credit ratings  is not well served by the company s larger competitors 
jmc has developed a reputation as a global participant in this segment of the market  and the company believes that jmc s reputation benefits the company 
there is  however  no assurance that competition from larger aircraft leasing companies will not increase significantly or that jmc s reputation will continue to be strong in this market segment 
casualties  insurance coverage 
the company  as owner of transportation equipment  may be named in a suit claiming damages for injuries or damage to property caused by its assets 
as a triple net lessor  the company is generally protected against such claims  since the lessee would be responsible for  insure against and indemnify the company for such claims 
although some protection with respect to the company s aircraft assets may be provided by the united states aviation act  it is unclear to what extent such statutory protection would be available to the company with respect to most of the company s aircraft  which are operated in foreign countries where such provisions of the united states aviation act may not apply 
the company s leases generally require a lessee to insure against likely risks of loss or damage to the leased asset  and liability to passengers and third parties pursuant to industry standard insurance policies and requires lessees to provide insurance certificates documenting the policy periods and coverage amounts 
the company tracks receipt of the certificates and calendars their expiration dates 
prior to the expiration of an insurance certificate  if a replacement certificate has not been received  the company reminds the lessee of its obligation to provide current insurance certificates 
despite these requirements and procedures  there may be certain cases where the loss is not entirely covered by the lessee or its insurance 
the possibility of such an event is remote  but any such uninsured loss with respect to the equipment or insured loss for which insurance proceeds are inadequate might result in a loss of invested capital in and any profits anticipated from  such equipment  as well as a potential claim directly against the company 
compliance with future environmental regulations 
compliance with future environmental regulations may harm the company s business 
many aspects of aircraft operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental regulations  and growing concerns about climate change may result in the imposition by the u 
s and foreign governments of additional regulation of carbon emissions  aimed at either requiring adoption of technology to reduce the amount of carbon emissions or putting in place a fee or tax system on carbon emitters 
it is likely that any such regulation will be directed at the company s customers  as operators of aircraft  or at the company  as owners of aircraft 
under the company s triple net arrangements  the company would likely shift responsibility for compliance to its lessees  but there might be some costs of regulation that the company could not shift and would itself have to bear 
although it is not expected that the costs of complying with current environmental regulations will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows  no assurance can be given that the costs of complying with environmental regulations adopted in the future will not have such an effect 
possible volatility of stock price 
the market price of the company s common stock may be subject to fluctuations following developments relating to the company s operating results  changes in general conditions in the economy  the financial markets  the airline industry  changes in accounting principles or tax laws applicable to the company or its lessees  or other developments affecting the company  its customers or its competitors  or arising from other investor sentiment unknown to the company 
because the company has a relatively small capitalization of approximately million shares outstanding  there is a correspondingly limited amount of trading and float of the company s shares 
consequently  the company s stock price is more sensitive to a single large trade or a small number of simultaneous trades along the same trend than a company with larger capitalization and higher trading volume and float
