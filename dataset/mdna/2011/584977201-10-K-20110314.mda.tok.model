assay development  bio analytical and bio equivalence studies are performed in our bio analytical laboratory 
these tests are conducted using methodologies such as immunoassay  gas chromatography  high performance liquid chromatography  gas chromatography mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry 
clients for our clinical testing services include clinical trial sponsors pharmaceutical and biotech companies  clinical research organizations cros  research organizations  and investigators with trial management  patient recruitment enrollment and site management 
the new brighton business center  llc nbbc is a wholly owned limited liability company formed for the sole purpose of acquiring the facilities in st 
paul  minnesota  where our laboratory services administrative offices and laboratory operations are located 
product sales our product sales business segment consists of our wholly owned subsidiary  medtox diagnostics  inc medtox diagnostics  inc 
is engaged in the development  manufacturing  and distribution of a variety of poct diagnostic drug screening devices  such as our profile ii  profile ii a  profile iii  profile iii a  profile ii er  profile iii er  profile iv  profile v  medtoxscan reader  verdict ii  and sure screen products  in addition to other diagnostic tests for the detection of alcohol 
medtox diagnostics  inc also provides contract manufacturing services  such as coagulation market controls 
the operations of the product sales segment are located in burlington  north carolina  where we maintain the offices  research and development laboratories  production operations  and warehouse distribution facilities 
key trends influencing our operating results our management believes that there are several notable trends that are currently influencing  and are expected in the foreseeable future to continue to influence  our operating results 
these include economic uncertainties causing variability in testing volumes in the laboratory services and product sales  drugs of abuse business in  testing volume from our existing workplace drugs of abuse clients was lower than in the prior year  which we primarily attributed to lower new job creation and reduced employment levels and corresponding drops in hiring caused by economic uncertainties 
we feel economic uncertainties may continue to cause variability in our workplace drugs of abuse testing volume in the foreseeable future 
increased poct diagnostic device test competition we have experienced increased competition with respect to our poct diagnostic tests from systems and products developed by others  many of whom compete solely on price 
due to the recent downturn in the economy  we have experienced increased price competition for certain diagnostic testing devices  particularly in the probation  parole and rehabilitation market 
our strategy our strategy is to drive profitable growth by building market share  leveraging our existing infrastructure and technical expertise  and driving innovation 
we maintain a disciplined culture  focused on the successful execution of our strategy and plans 
building market share we have solid niche positions in large markets  relative to our size  that allow us to build market share by offering high quality products and services that are delivered rapidly  priced competitively  and supported by excellent customer service and value added services 
our value added services include data management  collection site management  training  technical support and expertise  as well as review of drug testing policies for clients 
our success in penetrating new accounts has represented a significant component of our growth in market share 
over the past few years  we have expanded our number of sales representatives which has increased our business from new accounts and helps offset risks from uncertain economic conditions that may cause lower activity from existing workplace drugs of abuse clients 
leveraging existing infrastructure and technical expertise we leverage our existing infrastructure and technical expertise to facilitate top line growth and improve operating margins 
in  we expanded our clinical laboratory capabilities to include clinical and anatomic pathology  microbiology  molecular diagnostics  and other specialized testing capabilities 
this expansion leverages existing capabilities and opens up new revenue opportunities by offering full service testing capabilities to the physician office market 
our lean and six sigma initiatives support our effort to leverage existing infrastructure by improving quality and productivity  cutting costs  and increasing throughput 
lean is a highly disciplined process that helps us focus on reducing waste and eliminating unnecessary steps in our business processes 
our six sigma initiatives address quality and variability within processes 
while all key departments in the laboratory services and product sales segments have now been through initial lean processes  as an organization we recognize that lean is an ongoing philosophy  not a project to be finished 
driving innovation we have introduced a number of innovative products and services 
for example  in  we introduced the next generation profile v medtoxscan drugs of abuse test system with added functionality for hospital laboratories and emergency rooms 
in addition  in  we introduced toxassure  a comprehensive program for effective pain management testing 
critical accounting policies we have identified the policies outlined below as critical to understanding our business and results of operations 
the listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  with no need for management judgment in their application 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on the company s business operations is discussed throughout management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements in item note that the preparation of this annual report on form k requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition  accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts our sales are generally billed to three types of payers clients  patients and third parties  such as medicare and medicaid 
we are seeing an increase in the percentage of revenues that are billed to third party payers and patients as a result of growth in our clinical laboratory 
client sales are recorded at our list price  less any negotiated discount 
receivables due from clients represented approximately of our consolidated net accounts receivable balance at december  patients are billed at established patient fee schedules  net of any discounts negotiated with healthcare insurers or physicians on behalf of their patients 
patient billing is increasing as a result of the growth in patient copayments  coinsurance and deductibles and an increase in high deductible health plans 
collection of receivables due from patients is subject to credit risk and ability of the patients to pay 
receivables due from patients represented approximately of our consolidated net accounts receivable balance at december  we bill third party payers at our list price and third party revenue is recorded net of contractual discounts 
these discounts are recorded at the transaction level at the time of sale based on a fee schedule that is maintained for each third party payer 
our third party sales are recorded for each payer using a contracted fee schedule or an estimated fee schedule 
adjustments to the estimated payment amounts are recorded at the time of final collection and settlement of each transaction as an adjustment to net revenues 
these adjustments are not material to our results of operations in any period presented 
we periodically adjust these estimated fee schedules based upon historical payment trends 
receivables due from third parties represented approximately of our consolidated net accounts receivable balance at december  we have a standardized approach to estimate and review the collectability of our receivables based on the period of time they have been outstanding 
our process for determining the appropriate level of the allowance for doubtful accounts involves judgment  and considers such factors as the age of the underlying receivables  specific account reviews  historical collection experience  and other external factors that could affect the collectability of our receivables 
revisions to the allowances for doubtful accounts are recorded as an adjustment to bad debt expense within selling  general and administrative 
accounts are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts when they are deemed to be uncollectible 
our consolidated trade accounts receivable balance at december  was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
goodwill goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually and between annual test dates if events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment 
we perform our annual impairment test for goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year 
the entire amount of goodwill is included within the laboratory services segment 
the impairment test is performed using a two step process 
in the first step  the fair value of the reporting unit is compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit  including goodwill 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit  an indication that goodwill impairment exists and a second step must be completed in order to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment  if any that should be recorded 
in the second step  an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 
the fair value of the reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis 
projected discounted future cash flows requires us to make significant estimates regarding future revenues and expenses  projected capital expenditures  changes in working capital and the appropriate discount rate 
in developing this discounted cash flow analysis  assumptions about future revenues and expenses  capital expenditures and changes in working capital are based on our annual forecast for the reporting unit  historical experience  and anticipated future economic conditions 
discount rate assumptions for the reporting unit take into consideration our assessment of risks inherent in the future cash flows of the reporting unit and our weighted average cost of capital 
to assess the reasonableness of the fair value of the reporting unit  we use a market approach which consists of comparisons to comparable publicly traded companies in our industry 
at december   our goodwill was million 
if we experience significant negative economic trends or disruptions to our business  we may be subject to future impairments 
additionally  changes in assumptions regarding the future performance of our business  an increase in the discount rate used to determine the discounted cash flows  or significant declines in our stock price or the market as a whole could result in additional impairment indicators 
any future impairment of goodwill could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and tax planning strategies  and to the extent management believes that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we increase or decrease the valuation allowance in a period  we must include an expense or benefit within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
our deferred tax assets primarily consist of certain net operating losses nols carried forward 
in the future  revisions to the estimated net realizable value of these deferred tax assets could cause the provision for income taxes to vary significantly from period to period  although our cash payments would remain unaffected until the benefit of the nols is completely utilized or expires unused 
at december   we did not have a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 
we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the application of income tax law is inherently complex 
laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and are often ambiguous 
as such  we are required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures 
interpretations of and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time 
as such  changes in our subjective assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets and statements of income 
at december   we did not have any unrecognized tax benefits 
results of operations in evaluating our financial performance  our management has primarily focused on three objectives maximizing operating income  increasing our cash flows and strengthening our balance sheet 
the first of these objectives is discussed in this section 
the other two are addressed under liquidity and capital resources 
to maximize our operating income  we have sought revenue growth  improved gross margin and reduced selling  general and administrative sg a expense as a percentage of revenues 
as discussed below  during we were able to achieve revenue growth and improved gross margin  but we experienced an increase in sg a expenses as a percentage of revenues compared to the prior year period 
revenues year ended december vs vs in thousands change change change change revenues laboratory services drugs of abuse testing services clinical other laboratory services clinical trial services product sales our laboratory services segment includes revenues from drugs of abuse testing services  clinical other laboratory services and clinical trial services 
our revenues from drugs of abuse testing increased to million in and decreased to million in the increase in was primarily due to revenue growth from new clients  partially offset by a decline in revenue from existing drugs of abuse clients 
the decrease in was primarily a result of a decline in revenues from our existing drug of abuse clients due to challenging economic conditions affecting hiring decisions  partially mitigated by an increase in revenues from new drugs of abuse clients 
pricing for our workplace drugs of abuse testing services tends to be fairly stable overall  however  the average price per testing specimen can vary slightly from quarter to quarter 
test price can vary by client based on the percentage of samples that test positive for drugs of abuse and the average number of samples per shipment 
revenues from our clinical and other laboratory services increased to million and to million in and  respectively 
the improvement in and was primarily due to growth generated by our expanded clinical laboratory capabilities and diversification initiatives undertaken in revenues from clinical trial services increased to million and to million in and  respectively 
the increase in reflects the return to a more normalized level of activity after being negatively impact by our biopharmaceutical clients deferring projects and slowing down in research and development efforts in the fourth quarter of and first quarter of in  clinical trial services revenues were impacted  especially during the fourth quarter  by a slow down of projects and a deferral of work into revenues from clinical trial services can fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on the project nature  size  and the actual timing of clinical trials as shown in the table below revenues from clinical trial services first second third fourth in thousands quarter quarter quarter quarter revenues our product sales segment includes revenues from point of collection on site testing products poct  contract manufacturing services and other diagnostic products 
sales of poct products  which consist of the profile ii  profile ii a  profile ii er  profile iii er  profile iii  profile iii a  profile iv  profile v  verdict ii and sure screen on site test kits and other ancillary products for the detection of abused substances  increased to million in and decreased to million in the increase in was primarily due to strong sales in the workplace drugs of abuse market with our profile ii a and profile iii a products  and increased sales of profile v sold into the hospital market with our medtoxscan reader 
the decrease in was due primarily to a decline in revenues from device sales in the workplace market attributable to tough economic conditions affecting hiring decisions 
overall  pricing for our poct devices in was slightly lower than the prior year 
sales of contract manufacturing services increased to million in and decreased to million in the increase in was due to additional revenue from one of our clients whose contract expired on june  after an analysis of this product category in  we concluded that it had diminishing opportunities for us  and we are phasing out contract manufacturing services 
based on the expected increased sales of higher margin poct products  we do not anticipate a significant impact on our results of operations from exiting this business 
sales of other diagnostic products increased to million due to the sale of the new nexscreen panel diagnostic product 
sales of other diagnostic products were flat at million in compared to cost of revenues and gross margin year ended december vs vs in thousands of revenues of revenues of revenues change change change change cost of revenues cost of services cost of sales cost of services as a percentage of laboratory services revenues cost of sales as a percentage of product sales revenues consolidated gross margin was of revenues in  compared to of revenues in and of revenues in laboratory services gross margin was in  compared to in and in the increase in was primarily due to a change in test mix and an increase in volume 
the decrease in was due to the drop in drugs of abuse testing revenues over a highly fixed cost structure and higher costs associated with our clinical laboratory expansion 
gross margin from product sales was in  compared to in and in the increase in primarily reflects a shift in sales mix of poct devices  with an increase in higher margin profile devices sold into the workplace and hospital markets and a decrease in sales of lower margin sure screen devices into the government market 
the decrease in reflects a shift in sales mix of poct devices  with a decrease in sales of higher margin profile devices in the workplace market and an increase in sales of lower margin sure screen devices in the government market 
operating expenses year ended december vs vs in thousands of revenues of revenues of revenues change change change change operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million  or of revenues in  compared to million  or of revenues in and million  or of revenues in the increase in was primarily due to increased costs associated with the growth in clinical revenue and increased incentive based compensation 
increased expenses associated with the growth in our clinical other laboratory services business include the expansion of our sales force in the second half of last year  higher sales related expenses including sales commissions and travel related expenses  and an increase in bad debt and billing expenses related to increased third party and patient billing 
the increase in was due to an increase in sales and marketing expense and the reclassification of  from other income expense which was determined to be more appropriately classified in sg a expenses 
the increase was also due to an increase in retirement plan obligation which corresponds to an increase in the related marketable equity securities held in trust to fund this obligation 
the increase in retirement plan expense associated with the obligation was offset by a corresponding investment gain being recorded in other income expense 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the slight decrease in compared to was primarily due to decreased spending for on going product development projects in our product sales segment 
other income expense other income and expense consists primarily our investment gains losses  the net expenses associated with our building rental activities and interest expense 
other income was  in compared to  in other expense was million in the increase in was primarily due to the reclassification of  in the first quarter of from other income expense which was determined to be more appropriately classified in sg a expenses  partially offset by a decreased investment gain on our marketable equity securities held in trust for our deferred compensation plans 
our investment gain is offset by a corresponding loss being recorded in sg a expenses to reflect the change in the retirement plan obligation 
the income in compared to expense in was due to the reclassification of  from other income expense which was determined to be more appropriately classified in sg a expenses  as well as an investment gain on our marketable equity securities held in trust 
income taxes in  we recorded million in income tax expense  or an effective rate of  compared to an effective rate of in and in liquidity and capital resources our working capital requirements have been funded primarily by various combinations of profitable operations and cash received from our revolving credit facility 
cash and cash equivalents were million and million at december  and  respectively 
we are focusing on increasing our cash flow  while continuing to fund our capital investment  sales and marketing  and research and development initiatives 
our intent is to maintain a solid liquidity position 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in was attributable to an increase in net earnings  excluding non cash charges such as depreciation  amortization  deferred compensation and provision for losses on accounts receivable 
our increased revenues in have continued to drive increases in working capital 
the decrease in was primarily due to a decrease in net earnings 
net cash used in investing activities  consisting of capital expenditures  was million in compared to million and million in and  respectively 
these expenditures included equipment purchased and costs incurred to upgrade equipment  improve efficiencies and increase service levels to our clients 
in  we also invested in the expansion of our regional clinical laboratory capabilities 
we expect equipment and capital improvement expenditures to be between million and million in  with increased investment in instrumentation and facility improvements 
such expenditures are expected to be funded through cash provided by operating activities 
net cash used in financing activities was million in  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in was due to the payment of a special one time cash dividend of million  partially offset by advances of million from our revolving line of credit 
the decrease in was primarily due to a decrease in the repurchase of shares of our common stock 
in  we paid a special one time cash dividend of per share 
cash for the dividend was funded from cash on hand and borrowings from our revolving credit facility 
we declared the dividend based upon our improving performance  cash balance and anticipated ability to generate cash flow from operations  and therefore believed it was appropriate to return some capital to stockholders through a one time cash dividend 
in and  we repurchased  and  shares  respectively  of our common stock in the open market for a cost of million and million  respectively 
in  we repurchased  shares of our common stock from officers of our company for a cost of million 
the shares repurchased were placed in trust to fund our long term incentive plan and supplemental executive retirement plan 
we are a party to a credit security agreement the wells fargo credit agreement with wells fargo bank  national association the bank which expires on august  the wells fargo credit agreement  as amended  consists of a revolving line of credit line of credit of up to million bearing interest at a fluctuating rate of above the daily three month libor  as defined and calculated by the bank 
subject to certain conditions  the wells fargo credit agreement also provides for the issuance of letters of credit which  if drawn upon  would be deemed advances under the line of credit 
we are required to pay a fee equal to per annum on the average daily unused amount of the line of credit 
we have granted the bank a first priority security interest in all of the company s accounts receivable  other rights to payment  general intangibles  inventory  and equipment to secure all indebtedness of the company to the bank 
extensions of credit under the wells fargo credit agreement are subject to certain conditions 
the wells fargo credit agreement also requires us to comply with certain financial covenants  including maintaining  on a consolidated basis tangible net worth not less than  at each month end  with tangible net worth defined as the aggregate of total stockholders equity plus subordinated debt less any intangible assets 
current ratio not less than to at each month end  with current ratio defined as total current assets divided by total current liabilities 
pre tax profit of not less than  on a rolling four quarter basis  determined as of each fiscal quarter end 
we are relying on expected positive cash flow from operations and our line of credit to fund our future working capital and asset purchases 
at december   we had total borrowing capacity of million on our line of credit  of which million was borrowed  leaving a net availability of million 
in the short term  we believe that the aforementioned resources will be sufficient to fund our planned operations through while there can be no assurance that the available capital will be sufficient to fund our future operations beyond  we believe that future profitable operations  as well as access to additional capital through debt or equity financings  will be the primary means for funding our operations for the long term 
we continue to follow a plan which includes i aggressively monitoring and controlling costs  ii increasing revenues from sales of our existing products and services  iii developing new products and services  as well as iv selectively pursuing synergistic acquisitions to increase our critical mass 
however  there can be no assurance that costs can be controlled  revenues can be increased  financing may be obtained  acquisitions successfully consummated  or that we will be profitable 
disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table aggregates all contractual commitments and commercial obligations that affect the company s financial condition and liquidity position at december  payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years line of credit operating leases total contractual obligations amounts include interest payments based upon contractual or prevailing interest rates 
the table above excludes our obligation for future payments to participants under our supplemental executive retirement plan of approximately million at december  as the specific payment dates and amounts are unknown 
off balance sheet transactions we do not maintain any off balance sheet transactions  arrangements  obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or others that are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
impact of inflation and changing prices the impact of inflation and changing prices in our last three fiscal years has been primarily limited to salary  laboratory and operating supplies and rent increases and has historically not been material to our operations 
in the future  we may not be able to increase the prices of laboratory testing by an amount sufficient to cover the cost of inflation  although we are responding to these concerns by offering the highest quality products and services  delivered rapidly  priced competitively and supported by value added services for customers 
seasonality we believe that the laboratory testing business is subject to seasonal fluctuations in pre employment screening 
these seasonal fluctuations include reduced volume in the year end holiday periods  and other major holidays 
in addition  inclement weather may have a negative impact on volume thereby reducing net revenues and cash flow 
impact of new accounting standards there were no recently issued or newly adopted accounting standards that were applicable to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for or that we expect will become applicable to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in interest rates or currency exchange rates and prices 
our primary market risk exposures are to changes in interest rates 
during   and  we did not have sales denominated in foreign currencies nor did we have any subsidiaries located in foreign countries 
as such  we are not exposed to market risk associated with currency exchange rates and prices 
at december   we had approximately million outstanding on our line of credit with wells fargo bank and at december   we had approximately million outstanding on a term note with wells fargo bank 
the line of credit and term note with wells fargo bank bears interest at a variable rate of below the prime rate 
we have cash flow exposure on our committed and uncommitted line of credit and term note with wells fargo bank due to its variable prime rate pricing 
at december   a percentage point change in the prime rate would increase or decrease interest expense or cash flows by less than million 
we do not enter into derivative or other financial instruments or hedging transactions for trading or speculative purposes
