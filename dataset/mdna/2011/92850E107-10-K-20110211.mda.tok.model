during the us ltl business unit launched a new integrated operating system and completed the physical and operational integrations of all its ltl companies 
on december  these acquired companies were re organized for tax purposes with vitran s existing ltl operation vitran express inc indiana to form vitran express inc pennsylvania 
on january  vitran announced the proposed purchase of the assets of milan express s ltl division 
this acquisition  should it close on the targeted date of february   will add service centers including expanded and new state coverage in alabama  georgia  mississippi  north carolina  south carolina and tennessee 
within the united states  the company operates primarily within the eastern  central  southwestern and western united states and delivers approximately of its freight shipments within one or two days 
in addition  the company offers its services to the other regions in the united states other than alaska and hawaii through its strategic inter regional relationships 
the service is provided over the road  mostly by company drivers  which allows more control in servicing these time sensitive shipments 
vitran s us ltl business represented approximately of total ltl revenues for the year ended december  within canada  the company provides next day service within ontario  quebec and parts of western canada  and generates most of its revenue from the movement of ltl freight within the three to five day east west service lanes 
the majority of its trans canada freight is shipped intermodally  whereby the company s containers are loaded onto rail cars and trans loaded to vitran facilities where vitran s network of owner operators pick up and deliver the freight to various destinations 
an expedited service solution is also offered nationally using over the road driver teams to complete these deliveries in a shorter time frame 
vitran s canadian ltl business represented approximately of total ltl revenues for the year ended december  vitran s transborder service solution inter regional provides over the road service between its canadian ltl and us ltl business units 
this is the company s highest margin and fastest growing service  achieving a four year compounded average growth rate of approximately per annum at december  supply chain operation vitran s sco segment represented approximately of its revenues for the year ended december  the sco involves the management and transportation of goods and the provision of information about such goods as they pass through the supply chain from manufacturer to end user 
the sco s role is to design a supply chain network for a customer  contract with the necessary suppliers including vitran s ltl services  as well as implement the design and management of the logistical system 
vitran s sco offers a range of services in canada and the united states including cross docks  inventory management  flow through distribution facilities  and dedicated distribution facilities that focus primarily on long term customized supply chain solutions 
in addition  sco provides over the road or intermodal freight brokerage services with sales offices in toronto  montreal and los angeles so as to capitalize on international traffic flows in north america 
over the past decade  vitran has grown its sco segment organically and on november  announced the strategic acquisition of las vegas la express inc lvla  a retail supply chain management specialist based in ontario  california 
lvla operated six facilities  adding  square feet of logistics space 
as at december  sco had approximately million square feet of warehouse and distribution space under management 
truckload on november  the company sold the majority of the rolling stock of the former truckload segment for proceeds of million and retained the net working capital of million 
the company recorded a gain of million on the equipment sold and wrote off the remaining million of goodwill attributable to this business 
the operating results and divestiture of the segment have been recorded as a discontinued operation 

table of contents the trucking industry the trucking industry consists of two segments  specifically private fleets and for hire carriers 
the private carrier segment consists of fleets owned and operated by shippers who move their own goods 
the for hire segment is further divided into truckload tl and ltl sub segments  based on the typical shipment size handled by the carrier 
tl refers to carriers transporting shipments greater than  pounds and ltl refers to carriers generally transporting shipments less than  pounds 
vitran is predominantly an ltl carrier 
ltl carriers transport freight for multiple customers to multiple destinations on each trailer 
this service requires a network of local pick up and delivery terminals  hub facilities  and driver fleets 
the ltl business is capital intensive and achieving significant density of operations in a given region can afford a competitive advantage since greater freight volumes are better able to support fixed costs 
vitran believes the regional ltl industry offers a favorable operating model and provides substantial growth opportunities for the following reasons the trend among shippers toward minimal inventories  deferred air freight  and regional distribution has increased the demand for next day and second day delivery service  regional carriers with sufficient scale and freight density to support local terminal networks can offer greater service reliability and minimize the costs associated with intermediate handling  regional carriers are predominantly non union  which offers cost savings  greater flexibility  and a lower likelihood of service disruptions  compared with unionized carriers  and there has been a reduction of capacity as weaker competitors exit the business 
marketing and customers vitran derives its revenue from thousands of customers from a variety of geographic regions and industries in canada and the united states 
the company has no customer that represents more than of vitran s revenues 
at december   the company employed sales associates 
sales associates dialogue with new and retained customers within the geographic market 
new customers are obtained through referrals  cold calls and trade publications 
the sales associates receive a base salary and  depending on the business unit  a variable compensation package that can be linked to revenue generation  business unit profitability and days sales outstanding 
the ltl segment analyzes the price level that is appropriate for each particular shipment of freight 
when necessary  vitran competes to secure revenue by participating in bid solicitations  provided its customer recognizes the company as a core carrier over a contracted period of time 
in sco  vitran customizes each solution to fit the needs of the customer 
the sco pursues opportunities that will not only increase the profitability of that segment but will supplement activity in vitran s ltl segment as well 
employees at december  vitran employed approximately  full and part time employees and contracted with approximately owner operators 
the vast majority of our employees are not represented by unionized collective bargaining agreements 
the advantage of employing predominantly non union labour is more work rules flexibility with respect to work schedules  routes and other similar items 
work rule flexibility is important in our business segments to meet the service level requirements of our customers 
a total of vitran employees are represented by two labor unions  representing of the company s labour force 
the international brotherhood of teamsters and the canadian auto workers association represent dock workers in two of vitran s canadian terminals 
the company has never had a work stoppage 
the collective bargaining agreements between the company and its unionized employees expire on february  and on march   respectively 

table of contents information technology vitran uses technology to reduce costs  improve productivity  and enhance its customer service 
vitran allows its customers to access or exchange information with the company via vitran s website  published web services  electronic data interchange  or over the telephone 
the company uses sophisticated freight handling software to maximize its load average  reduce freight handling  reduce transit times  and improve tracking of shipments through its system 
in the second quarter of  vitran s us ltl business unit completed the process of migrating all of its us ltl operations to a common transportation operating system that further enhanced the company s technology platform and helped deliver superior service to its customers 
vitran s sco segment customizes the technology platform to its client requirements spanning the simplest of connections to highly integrated solutions 
seasonality in the trucking industry for a typical year  the months of september and october usually have the highest business levels  while the months of december  january and february generally have the lowest business levels 
adverse weather conditions generally experienced in the first quarter of the year  such as heavy snow and ice storms  have a negative impact on operating results 
accordingly  revenue and profitability are normally lowest in the first quarter 
regulation regulatory agencies exercise broad powers over the trucking industry  generally governing such activities as authorization to engage in motor carrier operations  safety and financial reporting 
the industry also may become subject to new or more restrictive regulations relating to fuel emissions  ergonomics  or limits on vehicle weight and size 
additional changes in the laws and regulations governing the trucking industry could affect the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or by influencing the demand for and the costs of providing services to customers 
in addition to the us department of transportation dot  vitran is subject to regulations from  but not limited to  the department for homeland security  environmental protection agency  and the food and drug administration 
from time to time  various legislative proposals that might affect the trucking industry are introduced  including proposals to increase federal  state  provincial or local taxes  including taxes on motor fuels 
vitran cannot predict whether  or in what form  any increase in such taxes applicable to the company will be enacted 
increased taxes could adversely affect vitran s profitability 
vitran s employees and owner operators also must comply with the safety and fitness regulations promulgated by the dot and various regulatory authorities in canada  including those relating to drug and alcohol testing and hours of service 
competition vitran competes with many other transportation service providers of varying sizes within canada and the united states 
in the united states  vitran competes mainly in the eastern  central  southwestern and western states 
the transportation industry is highly competitive on the basis of both price and service 
the company competes with regional  inter regional and national ltl carriers  truckload carriers  third party logistics companies and  to a lesser extent  small package carriers  air freight carriers and railroads 
the company competes effectively in its markets by providing high quality and timely service at competitive prices

table of contents item a risk factors risks and uncertainties an investment in our company involves a high degree of risk 
before making an investment in the common shares of the company  you should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information contained in this annual report on form k 
the risks described below are not the only ones facing our company or otherwise associated with an investment in the company 
if we do not successfully address any of the risks described herein or therein  there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition  operating results and business  and the trading price of our common shares may decline 
we can provide no assurance that we will successfully address these risks 
risks relating to our company our industry is highly competitive  and our business will suffer if we are unable to adequately address potential downward pricing pressures and other factors that may adversely affect operations and profitability 
the transportation industry is highly competitive on the basis of both price and service 
we compete with regional  inter regional and national ltl carriers  truckload carriers  third party logistics companies and  to a lesser extent  small package carriers  air freight carriers and railroads 
numerous competitive factors could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability 
these factors include the following we compete with many other transportation service providers of varying sizes  many of which have more equipment  a broader coverage network  a wider range of services and greater capital resources than we do or have other competitive advantages  some of our competitors periodically reduce their prices to gain business  especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy  which may limit our ability to maintain or increase our prices or maintain significant growth in our business  many customers reduce the number of carriers they use by selecting so called core carriers as approved transportation service providers  and in some instances we may not be selected  our customers may negotiate rates or contracts that minimize or eliminate our ability to offset fuel price increases through a fuel surcharge on our customers  many customers periodically accept bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs  and this process may depress prices or result in the loss of some business to competitors  the trend towards consolidation in the surface transportation industry may create other large carriers with greater financial resources than us and other competitive advantages relating to their size  advances in technology require increased investments to remain competitive  and our customers may not be willing to accept higher prices to cover the cost of these investments  and competition from non asset based logistics and freight brokerage companies may adversely affect our customer relationships and prices 
we are subject to financial covenants under our term and revolving credit facilities 
under our current term and revolving credit facilities  we are subject to certain financial covenants that  among other things  require maintenance of certain maximum leverage  minimum ebitda and minimum interest and rent coverage ratios 
these financial covenants could limit the availability of capital to fund future growth 
in addition  our inability to continue to successfully operate our business and achieve our level of financial performance could cause us not to be able to be in continued compliance with these covenants 
our inability to maintain compliance with our financial covenants could result in a default under our credit facilities which could require us to attempt to re negotiate these financial covenants  attempt to obtain new financing or 
table of contents scale back our business operations to achieve compliance 
there is no assurance that we would be able to re negotiate our financial covenants in this event which could reduce the amount of credit available under our credit facilities 
we are subject to general economic factors that are largely out of our control  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations 
our business is subject to a number of general economic factors that may have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations  many of which are largely out of our control 
these include recessionary economic cycles and downturns in customer business cycles  particularly in market segments and industries  such as retail  manufacturing and chemical  where we have a significant concentration of customers 
economic conditions may adversely affect the business levels of our customers  the amount of transportation services they need and their ability to pay for our services 
it is not possible to predict the long term effects of above mentioned factors on the economy or on customer confidence in canada or the united states  or the impact  if any  on our future results of operations 
adverse changes in economic conditions could result in declines to our revenues and a reduction in our current level of profitability 
if the world wide financial crisis worsens  it could adversely impact demand for our services 
the global capital markets have been experiencing significant disruption and volatility over the past two years as evidenced by a lack of liquidity in the debt markets  significant write offs in the financial services sector  the re pricing of credit risk in the broadly syndicated credit market and failure of certain major financial institutions 
continued market disruptions could cause broader economic downturns which may lead to lower demand for our services  increased incidence of customers inability to pay their accounts  or insolvency of our customers  any of which could adversely affect our results of operations  liquidity  cash flows and financial condition 
moreover  such market disruptions may increase our cost of borrowing or affect our ability to access debt and equity capital markets 
market conditions may affect our ability to refinance indebtedness as and when it becomes due 
we are unable to predict the effect the uncertainty in the capital markets may have on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
our ability to repay or refinance our indebtedness will depend upon our future operating performance which will be affected by general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors beyond our control 
our supply chain operation business is dependent upon long term relationships with our customers 
we have entered into long term relationships with our customers whereby we have agreed to provide supply chain solutions to our customers which involve the establishment and operation of warehousing  inventory management and flow through distribution facilities 
the success of these relationships is dependent upon our continued ability to meet the requirements under our customers contracts  as well as the continued financial success and business operations of our customers 
if we are unable to continue to deliver our supply chain solutions to our customers  either as a result of a determination by our customers not to continue to use our services or our customer ceasing to operate its business for any reason  our revenues from our supply chain solutions business may decline and we may not be able to recover our investment in the distribution facilities that we have established to deliver these services to our customers 
increases in our operating expenses could cause our profitability to decline 
our significant cash operating expenses include salaries  wages and employee benefits  purchased transportation  maintenance expenses  rents and leases  purchased labor and owner operators  fuel and fuel related expenses 
increases in our operating expenses will adversely impact on our profitability to the extent that we are not able to pass these increased expenses on to our customers through increased rates for our transportation services 
many of these operating expenses are beyond our control and  in addition  are subject to competitive forces 
further  we operate in a price sensitive industry where customers have many alternatives for their transportation services and  as a result  we may have limited ability to pass on increased operating expenses to our customers 

table of contents unsuccessful execution of our acquisition strategy could cause our business and future growth prospects to suffer 
we may not be able to implement our strategy to acquire other transportation companies  which depends in part on the availability of suitable candidates 
in addition  we may face competition for the acquisition of attractive carriers from other consolidators in the freight transportation industry who may be larger or better financed than we are 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that if we acquire what we consider to be a suitable candidate in accordance with our growth strategy  we will be able to successfully integrate the operations of the acquired company into our operations on an accretive basis 
if we are unable to successfully integrate the operations of the acquired company  we may not be able to achieve the anticipated benefits of such acquisition and the performance of our operations after completion of such acquisition could be adversely affected 
significant ongoing capital requirements could limit growth and affect profitability 
our business is capital intensive 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations to fund our capital requirements  we may have to limit our growth  utilize our existing  or enter into additional  financing arrangements 
while we intend to finance expansion and renovation projects with existing cash  cash flow from operations and available borrowings under our existing credit agreement  we may require additional financing to support our continued growth 
however  due to the existing uncertainty in the capital and credit markets  capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us 
if we are unable in the future to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or borrow the necessary capital to fund our planned capital expenditures  we will be forced to limit our growth and or operate our equipment for longer periods of time  resulting in increased maintenance costs  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
if any of the financial institutions that have extended credit commitments to us are or continue to be adversely affected by current economic conditions and disruption to the capital and credit markets  they may become unable to fund borrowings under their credit commitments or otherwise fulfill their obligations to us  which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and our ability to borrow additional funds  if needed  for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other corporate purposes 
the engines in our newer tractors are subject to new emissions control regulations which could substantially increase operating expenses 
tractor engines that comply with the environmental protection agency epa emission control design requirements that took effect on january  are generally less fuel efficient and have increased maintenance costs compared to engines in tractors manufactured before these requirements became effective 
in addition  compliance with the more stringent epa requirements that were made effective in could results in further declines in fuel efficiency and increases in maintenance costs 
if we are unable to offset resulting increases in fuel expenses or maintenance costs with higher freight rates  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
we are a corporation based outside the united states 
we are a canadian based corporation with substantial operations in the united states 
changes in united states laws or the application thereof  including regulatory  homeland security or taxation  that primarily impact foreign corporations could have a material adverse effect on our prospects  business  financial condition and results of operations 
increased regulation could increase both the time and cost of transportation across the united states canada border with the result that demand for cross border transportation services may decline and our costs of providing these services may increase 
fluctuations in the price and availability of fuel may adversely impact profitability 
fuel is a significant operating expense 
we do not hedge against the risk of fuel price increases 
any increase in fuel taxes or fuel prices or any change in federal  state or provincial regulations that results in such an increase  to the extent that the increase is not offset by freight rate increases or fuel surcharges to customers  or any interruption in the supply of fuel  could have a material adverse effect on our business  operations or financial condition 

table of contents while we have historically been able to adjust our pricing to offset changes to the cost of fuel through changes to base rates and or fuel surcharges  we cannot be certain that we will be able to do so in the future 
in addition  we are subject to risks associated with the availability of fuel  which are subject to political  economic and market factors that are outside of our control 
we would be adversely affected by an inability to obtain fuel in the future 
although historically we have been able to obtain fuel from various sources and in the desired quantities  there can be no assurance that this will continue to be the case in the future 
our industry is subject to numerous laws and regulations in canada and the united states  exposing us to potential claims and compliance costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we are subject to numerous laws and regulations by the us department of transportation dot  environmental protection agency  internal revenue service  canada revenue agency and various other federal  state  provincial and municipal authorities 
such regulatory agencies exercise broad powers over our business  generally governing such activities as authorization to engage in motor carrier operations and safety  and financial reporting 
our employees and owner operators must also comply with the safety and fitness regulations promulgated by the dot  including those relating to drug and alcohol testing and hours of service  driver hours of service limitations  labour organizing activities  stricter cargo security requirements  tax laws and environmental matters  including potential limits on carbon emissions under climate change legislation 
we may become subject to new or more restrictive regulations relating to fuel emissions  ergonomics  or limits on vehicle weight and size 
we are not able to accurately predict how new governmental laws and regulations  or changes to existing laws and regulations  will affect the transportation industry generally  or us in particular 
although government regulation that affects us and our competitors may simply result in higher costs that can be passed to customers  there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
any additional measures that may be required by future laws and regulations or changes to existing laws and regulations may require us to make changes to our operating practices or services provided to our customers and may result in additional costs  all of which could have an adverse effect on us 
changes in governmental regulation may impact future cash flows and profitability 
in canada  carriers must obtain licenses issued by each provincial transport board in order to carry goods extra provincially or to transport goods within any province 
licensing from us regulatory authorities is also required for the transportation of goods between canada and the united states and within the united states 
any change in these regulations could have an impact on the scope of our activities 
there is no assurance that we will be in full compliance at all times with such policies and guidelines 
as a result  we could be required  at some future date  to incur significant costs in order to maintain or improve our compliance record 
results of operations may be affected by seasonal factors and harsh weather conditions 
our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
in the trucking industry for a typical year  the second and third quarters usually have the highest business levels  while the first and fourth quarters generally have the lowest business levels 
the fourth quarter holiday season and adverse weather conditions generally experienced in the first quarter of the year  such as heavy snow and ice storms  have a negative impact on operating results 
if additional employees unionize  our operating costs would increase 
we have a history of positive labour relations that will continue to be important to future success 
two of our terminals in canada  representing of our labour force  are represented by the international brotherhood of teamsters and the canadian auto workers association 
the collective bargaining agreements between us and our unionized employees expire on february   and on march   respectively 
there can be no assurance that the collective bargaining agreements will be renegotiated on terms acceptable or favourable to us 
there can be no assurance that other employees will not unionize in the future 
from time to time there could be efforts to organize our employees at various other terminals  which could increase our operating costs and force us to alter our operating methods 
this could  in turn  have a material adverse effect on our business  operations or financial condition 

table of contents changes to our compensation and benefits could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain employees 
like many other companies  we had implemented certain salary and wage cost initiatives in such initiatives include the suspension of our k matching program and a percent compensation reduction across all employees of the company 
the company has committed to return a quarter of the salary and wage reduction on the first day of each fiscal quarter in however  due to the salary and wage cost initiatives that we took in  we may still find it difficult to attract  retain and motivate employees  and any such difficulty could materially adversely affect our business 
various environmental laws and regulations  and costs of compliance with  liabilities under  or violations of  existing or future environmental laws or regulations could adversely affect our results 
our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations dealing with the handling of hazardous materials  underground fuel storage tanks and discharge and retention of storm water 
we operate in industrial areas where truck terminals and other industrial activities are located and where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination may have occurred 
our operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage  environmental damage and hazardous waste disposal  among others 
if we are involved in a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances or if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations  it could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
if we fail to comply with applicable environmental regulations  we could be subject to substantial fines or penalties and to civil and criminal liability 
in addition  as global warming issues become more prevalent  federal and local governments and our customers are beginning to respond to these issues 
this increased focus on sustainability may result in new regulations and customer requirements that could negatively affect us 
this could cause us to incur additional direct costs or to make changes to our operations in order to comply with any new regulations and customer requirements  as well as increased indirect costs or loss of revenue resulting from  among other things  our customers incurring additional compliance costs that affect our costs and revenues 
we could also lose revenue if our customers divert business from us because we have not complied with their sustainability requirements 
these costs  changes and loss of revenue could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
loss of key personnel could harm our business  operations or financial condition 
the success of our business is dependent upon the active participation of certain management personnel who have extensive experience in the industry 
the loss of the services of one or more of such personnel for any reason may have an adverse effect on our business if we are unable to secure replacement personnel that have sufficient experience in our industry and in the management of a transportation business such as ours 
our inability to successfully replace management personnel could result in a disruption to our business that could adversely impact our profitability and financial condition 
we face litigation risks that could have a material adverse effect on the operation of our business 
from time to time we face litigation regarding various alleged violations of state labor laws 
these proceedings may be time consuming  expensive and disruptive to normal business operations 
the defense of such lawsuits could result in significant expense and the diversion of our management s time and attention from operation of our business 
some or all of the amount we may be required to pay to defend or to satisfy a judgment or settlement of any or all these proceedings may not be covered by insurance and could have a material adverse effect on us 
exchange rate and currency risks may impact our financial results 
as we operate both in the united states and in canada  our financial results are affected by changes in the us dollar exchange rate relative to the currencies of other countries including the canadian dollar 
to reduce the exposure to currency fluctuations  we may enter into limited foreign exchange contracts from time to time  but these hedges do not eliminate the potential that such fluctuations may have an adverse effect on us 
in 
table of contents addition  foreign exchange contracts expose us to the risk of default by the counterparties to such contracts  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our inability to successfully mitigate our exposure to currency fluctuations could result in increased expenses attributable to foreign exchange loss 
insurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our profitability 
our operations are subject to risks normally inherent in the freight transportation industry  including potential liability which could result from  among other circumstances  personal injury or property damage arising from accidents or incidents involving trucks operated by us or our agents 
the availability of  and ability to collect on  insurance coverage is subject to factors beyond our control 
in addition  we may become subject to liability for hazards which we cannot or may not elect to insure because of high premium costs or other reasons  or for occurrences which exceed maximum coverage under our policies 
our future insurance and claims expenses might exceed historical levels  which could reduce our earnings 
increases to our premiums could further increase our insurance and claims expenses as current coverages expire or cause us to raise our self insured retention 
if the number or severity of claims for which we are self insured increases  or we suffer adverse development in claims compared with our reserves  or any claim exceeded the limits of our insurance coverage  this could have a material adverse effect on our business  operations or financial condition 
moreover  any accident or incident involving us  even if we are fully insured or held not to be liable  could negatively affect our reputation among customers and the public  thereby making it more difficult for us to compete effectively  and could significantly affect the cost and availability of insurance in the future 
we rely on purchased transportation  making us vulnerable to increases in costs of these services 
in canada  we use purchased transportation  primarily intermodal rail from cn rail  to provide cost effective service on our east west national ltl service offering 
any reduction in service by the railroad or increase in the cost of such rail services is likely to increase costs for us and reduce the reliability  timeliness and overall attractiveness of rail based services 
this would negatively impact our ability to provide our services  with the result that we may be forced to use more expensive or less efficient alternative modes of transportation to provide our services to our customers 
in the united states  we use purchased transportation primarily to handle lane imbalances and to accommodate surges in business 
we will also  on occasion  augment our linehaul capacity during certain peak periods through the use of purchased transportation 
a reduction in the availability of purchased transportation may require us to incur increased costs to satisfy customer shipping orders and we may be unable to pass along increases in third party shipping prices to our customers 
our business may be adversely affected by anti terrorism measures 
federal  state  provincial and municipal authorities have implemented and are continuing to implement various anti terrorism measures  including checkpoints and travel restrictions on large trucks 
if additional security measures disrupt or impede the timing of our deliveries  we may fail to meet the needs of our customers or may incur increased expenses to do so 
this could result in a reduction in demand for our cross border transportation services and increase the cost of providing these services  each of which could negatively impact our profitability 
there can be no assurance that new anti terrorism measures will not be implemented and that such new measures will not have a material adverse effect on our business  operations or financial condition 
interest rate fluctuations will impact our financial results 
in order to mitigate the exposure to interest rate risk in and for future periods  we entered into floating to fixed interest rate swap contracts with various expiry dates extending to december  management continues to evaluate our need to fix interest rate exposure or unwind current interest rate swap contracts on an ongoing basis 
our inability to successfully mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk could result in us being exposed to increases to interest rates  which interest rate increases would increase our operating costs 

table of contents difficulty in attracting qualified drivers could adversely affect our profitability and ability to grow 
we are dependent on our ability to hire and retain qualified drivers including owner operators 
there is significant competition for qualified drivers within the trucking industry and attracting and retaining drivers has become more challenging 
if we are unable to attract drivers and contract with owner operators  we may experience shortages of qualified drivers that could result in us not meeting customer demands  pressure to upwardly adjust our driver compensation package  underutilization of our truck fleet and or use of higher cost purchased transportation  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  our growth and profitability 
our information technology systems are subject to certain risks that we cannot control 
we depend on our information technology systems in order to deliver reliable transportation services to our customers in an efficient and timely manner 
we have integrated the information technology and operations of our acquired companies and will integrate future acquisitions within our us ltl business unit 
any disruption to our technology infrastructure could result in delays in delivery of transportation services to our clients and increased operating costs as a result of decreased operating efficiencies  each of which could adversely impact our customer service  revenues and profitability 
while we have invested and continue to invest in technology security initiatives and disaster recovery plans  these measures cannot fully protect us from technology disruptions that could have a material adverse effect on us 
our information technology remains susceptible to outages  computer viruses  break ins and similar disruptions that may inhibit our ability to provide services to our customers and the ability of our customers to access our systems 
this may result in the loss of customers or a reduction in demand for our services

overview vitran corporation inc vitran or the company is a leading  predominantly non union  provider of freight surface transportation and related supply chain services throughout canada and in states in the eastern  central  southwestern and western united states 
its business consists of two operating segments less than truckload services ltl and supply chain operation sco 
these services are provided by stand alone business units within their respective regions 
depending on a customer s needs  the units can operate independently or in a complementary manner 
as is more fully described in item business  the ltl segment transports shipments in less than full trailer load quantities through freight service center networks  the sco segment provides supply chain solutions and freight brokerage services 
vitran s operating results are generally expected to depend on the number and weight of shipments transported  the prices received for the services provided  and the mix of services supplied to clients 
vitran must manage its fixed and variable operating cost infrastructure in the face of fluctuating volumes to realize appropriate margins while maintaining the quality service expected by its customers 
the long term mission of the company is to build a north american transportation infrastructure in both canada and the united states offering regional  inter regional  national  and transborder ltl services 
in conjunction with the ltl services  vitran will also focus on sco offerings that are not only profitable as stand alone business opportunities  but also increase the utilization of ltl freight service assets where appropriate 
on november  vitran divested of substantially all of the rolling stock of its truckload business 
the truckload business delivered full trailer loads point to point on a predominantly short haul basis 
this operation was not connected to the ltl or sco segments and was not considered strategic to the continuing operations of vitran 
on january  vitran announced the proposed purchase of the assets of milan express s ltl division 
this acquisition  should it close on the targeted date of february   will add service centers including expanded and new state coverage of alabama  georgia  mississippi  north carolina  south carolina and tennessee 
executive summary the fiscal year marked a financial rebound for vitran as the company operated through the most challenging period in the history of the transportation industry since the great depression in although improvements were achieved in  it was still a demanding year  economic reservations throughout the world resulted in weak improvements in freight demand  particularly in the united states 
however  vitran had a number of important accomplishments returned profitability to the company s income from continuing operations  set record quarterly and annual income from operations in the sco segment  
table of contents the ltl segment generated income from operations by sequential quarter over quarter increases in yield within the us ltl business unit for  quarter over prior year quarter growth in daily shipments every quarter in within the us ltl business unit  increased the us ltl business units length of haul in compared to  the cdn ltl business unit retained its market share and maintained positive income from operations  divested of the non core truckload segment  reduced consolidated debt and leverage ratio  to year lows achieving a bps reduction in syndicated interest rate margins 
these achievements were the result of tireless effort and support from the management  office staff and most importantly  the front line drivers and dock workers at vitran 
results of operations compared to consolidated results the following table summarizes the consolidated statements of income loss for the three years ended december in thousands of dollars vs vs revenue salaries  wages and employee benefits purchased transportation depreciation and amortization maintenance rents and leases purchased labor and owner operators fuel and fuel related expenses other operating expenses impairment of goodwill other income income loss from continuing operations interest expense  net net income loss from continuing operations net income loss from discontinued operations net income loss vs vs earnings loss per share basic continuing operations basic net income loss diluted continuing operations diluted continuing operations operating ratio revenue increased by to million in from million in revenue in the ltl and sco segments increased and respectively 
revenue for the year was impacted by a stronger canadian dollar and an increase in fuel surcharge revenue accounting for approximately million of the consolidated revenue improvement 
excluding the impact of fuel surcharge revenue and a stronger canadian dollar  revenue compared to improved 
detailed explanations for the fluctuations in revenue and income from operations are discussed below and in segmented results 

table of contents salaries  wages and employee benefits increased to million for compared million in this increase can be attributed to an increase in average employee headcount to  employees in compared to  employees for headcount increased in the ltl segment and in the sco segment 
commencing january   vitran committed to return a quarter of the wage reduction received from its employees in at the start of each quarter in therefore  salaries  wages and employee benefits are expected to increase in purchased transportation increased in compared to due to an increase in ltl segment activity as indicated by the increase in shipments and the increase in length of haul within the us ltl business unit 
although  purchased transportation is higher than management desires  the increase was partially offset by a reduction in driver wages as a percentage of revenue 
should the us ltl business unit continue to experience significant shipment growth above the levels  purchased transportation expense will continue to grow 
it is management s intention to replace purchased transportation with company drivers and equipment as lane density  revenue per hundredweight and financial results appear sustainable and warrant the commitment to company drivers and the investment in equipment 
lastly  increased shipment levels in the canadian ltl business unit and rate increases from the railway resulted in an increase in this business unit s purchased transportation costs in depreciation and amortization expense declined for compared to  and is primarily attributable to the sale of rolling stock and buildings during the year 
the company sold facilities in cleveland  ohio  grand rapids  michigan and mattoon  illinois 
these rolling stock and facility sales resulted in gains on dispositions of approximately million in the the company expects to purchase more rolling stock in and therefore expects depreciation expense to increase in coming years 
maintenance expense increased to million for compared to million for however  as a percentage of revenue  maintenance expense declined to for compared to for the decline in maintenance expense as a percentage of revenue can be attributed to the new units of rolling stock added in the fourth quarter of and pieces of new rolling stock added in furthermore  as the company replaces older equipment in  it expects maintenance expense as a percentage of revenue to decline 
rents and leases expense increased for compared to the increase is a result of the aforementioned new units of rolling stock added in the fourth quarter of and pieces of new rolling stock added in  all financed by operating lease commitments 
purchased labor and owner operator expenses increased for compared to  primarily driven by the increase in owner operator expenses in the canadian ltl business unit and the increases in purchased labour within the sco segment consistent with their increase in activity levels 
fuel and fuel related expenses increased for compared to the average price of diesel increased approximately in compared furthermore  the ltl segment s consumption increased due to the increase in activity as indicated by the improvements in shipments and the growth in the length of haul in the us ltl business unit 
the company incurred interest expense of million in compared to interest expense of million in the company s interest rate spread on its syndicated revolving and term debt was on average bps less than in addition the company reduced total balance sheet debt to million at december  compared to million at december  lastly  with the reduction in its aggregate debt outstanding and improved earnings in  the company earned an additional bps reduction on its syndicated interest rate margins commencing in the first quarter of in accordance with financial accounting standard board fasb accounting standard codification fasb asc  included in the tax expense is the recognition of a million valuation allowance for all us deferred tax assets 
the majority of the deferred tax assets were for timing differences related to tax deductible goodwill and net loss carryforwards 
the net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in and will continue to be available to offset future years taxable income 
management believes the company will generate sufficient taxable income to use these losses in the future  but not to the level of certainty required by fasb asc 
table of contents on november  the company sold the majority of the rolling stock of the former truckload segment for proceeds of million and retained the net working capital of million 
the company recorded a gain of million on the equipment sold and wrote off the remaining million of goodwill attributable to this business 
the operating results and divestiture of the segment have been recorded as a discontinued operation 
net loss from continuing operations  including the aforementioned valuation allowance  was million for compared to a net loss from continuing operations of million in this resulted in basic and diluted loss per share from continuing operations of for the current year compared to loss per basic and diluted share from continuing operations of in loss from discontinued operations was million compared to income from discontinued operations of million in therefore the company posted a net loss of million for compared to a net loss of million in this resulted in basic and diluted loss per share of for the current year compared to a loss per basic and diluted share of in fasb asc update no

fasb asc update no 
was adopted january   except for the requirement to separately disclose purchases  sales  issuances and settlements of recurring level fair value measurements which is effective january  segmented results ltl less than truckload the table below provides summary information for the ltl segment for the three years ended december in thousands of dollars vs vs revenue income loss from operations impairment of goodwill operating ratio number of shipments weight s of lbs revenue per shipment revenue per hundredweight revenue in the ltl segment increased by to million in compared to million in the increase in revenue was influenced by fuel surcharge which represented of revenue in compared to in therefore  revenue net of fuel surcharge for increased compared to revenue was impacted by a slight improvement in the north american economic environment and more importantly improved pricing in the ltl segment as indicated by the increase in shipments of and increase in revenue per hundred weight of 
shipments per day in the us ltl business unit increased for compared to this can be attributed to integrated operating footprint in the united states allowing the business to expand its service offering across longer lanes and achieve market share growth 
this was confirmed by a increase in length of haul for in addition from february  when the business unit commenced its pricing initiative  to december  revenue per hundredweight excluding fuel surcharge improved 
the ltl segment made additional enhancements early in april of  re engineering its linehaul and pick up and delivery operations to reduce claims expense  dock handling costs and linehaul expenses  as well as a reduction in wages and salaries for all employees 
these changes along with the 
table of contents consolidation of the us ltl purchasing department resulted in income from operations for and an operating ratio of for the year compared to for management believes that with the new integrated us ltl operating model  the current sales and pricing momentum and additional operating initiatives  the segment is well positioned to contribute income from operations over the long term 
supply chain operation the table below provides summary information for the sco segment for the three years ended december in thousands of dollars vs vs revenue income from operations operating ratio revenue for the sco segment increased by to million compared to million in the sco segment posted record income from operations of million  a increase over the increase in income from operations for can be attributed to a full year of activity from the  square feet of distribution space added in ontario  california and san antonio  texas in in addition the sco segment also added a combined  square feet of distribution space in salt lake city  utah and albuquerque  new mexico in the third quarter of as at december   the sco segment had approximately million square feet under management compared to million square feet under management at december  that contributed to the record results 
it is the company s expectation to increase the square footage under management in and maximize existing capacity to increase revenue and income from operations 
results of operations compared to consolidated results revenue decreased by to million in from million in revenue in the ltl and sco segments decreased  and respectively 
revenue for the year was impacted by a weaker canadian dollar and a decline in fuel surcharge revenue accounted for approximately million of the consolidated revenue decline 
excluding the impact of fuel surcharge revenue and a weaker canadian dollar  revenue compared to only declined 
detailed explanations for the fluctuations in revenue and income from operations are discussed below in and in segmented results 
salaries  wages and employee benefits declined to million for compared million in this decline can be attributed to a decline in average employee headcount of  employees in compared to  employees for the majority of the headcount reductions took place in the fourth quarter of and there was a company wide wage and salary reduction in the second quarter of purchased transportation declined in compared to due to an emphasis on purchased transportation cost reductions in the us ltl business resulting from the new integrated operating region 
furthermore  the general decline in economic activity  as indicated by the decline in total ltl shipments of for the year  contributed to less purchased transportation expense throughout the entire company 
depreciation and amortization expense declined for compared to  and is primarily attributable to the sale of rolling stock during the year and a reduction of purchased rolling stock compared to historical average annual purchases 
the company sold units in and units in the fourth quarter of furthermore  the company sold facilities in louisville and bowling green  kentucky and st 
cloud  minnesota 
these rolling stock and facility sales resulted in gains on dispositions of approximately million in the 
table of contents maintenance expense declined to million for compared to million for the decline in maintenance expense can be attributed to the aforementioned reductions in rolling stock as well as the closure of operating facilities due to the completion of the us ltl operations integration in the fourth quarter of in april of  the us ltl business unit re engineered its linehaul model and closed another in market facilities contributing to further maintenance cost reductions 
lastly  during the third quarter of  the us ltl business unit amalgamated maintenance departments and initiated a consolidated purchasing program that resulted in a decrease in maintenance expense in the fourth quarter and should contribute to additional savings in future periods 
rents and leases expense declined for the compared to  but increased in the fourth quarter of the year 
during the fourth quarter of  the company placed pieces of new rolling stock on operating lease partially offsetting rents and leases cost reductions attributable to the decline in leased facilities in the us ltl business unit 
also operating leases associated with approximately units of rolling stock expired at the end of the second quarter 
purchased labor and owner operator expenses declined for compared to  primarily driven by a reduction in owner operator expenses in the canadian ltl business unit 
shipments and tonnage declined and  respectively compared to  thereby resulting in less owner operator expense 
fuel and fuel related expenses declined for compared to the average price of diesel declined approximately in compared at december  the company assessed its goodwill for impairment 
at that moment in time  the company s market capitalization was significantly lower than the carrying value of its net assets thereby indicating impairment of goodwill 
consequently  vitran recorded a pre tax non cash impairment charge of million at december  there was no goodwill impairment charges recorded in the company incurred net interest expense of million in compared to net interest expense of million in the company s interest rate spread on its syndicated revolving and term debt was on average bps greater than  however  the underlying decline in average libor on the syndicated debt partially offset the increase in the interest rate spread resulting in a million increase in interest expense for compared to more importantly  the company reduced its aggregate debt and improved its earnings in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of resulting in a bps reduction on its syndicated interest rate spreads commencing in the first quarter of income tax recovery for was million compared to million in the tax recovery includes the tax impact of the aforementioned goodwill impairment charge 
the tax recovery can be attributed to a loss before tax 
on a consolidated basis  the company generated taxable losses in the united states  which in were recognized as deferred tax assets 
these taxable losses are the result of tax depreciation and amortization on property and equipment and goodwill in excess of gaap depreciation and amortization attributable to the company s acquired businesses over the last four years 
should the company s earnings before income tax increase in subsequent quarters  the effective tax rate should also increase 
net loss was million for compared to a net loss of million in this resulted in basic and diluted loss per share of for compared to loss per basic and diluted share of in excluding the goodwill impairment charge and one time write off of previously deferred financing costs  adjusted net income would have been million or basic and diluted income per share of for the year 

table of contents segmented results ltl less than truckload revenue in the ltl segment decreased by to million in compared to million in the decrease in revenue was significantly influenced by fuel surcharge which represented of revenue in compared to in therefore  revenue net of fuel surcharge for declined compared to revenue was impacted by the weak economic environment in north america in as indicated by the decline in shipments and tonnage of and respectively compared to shipments per day in the us ltl business unit decreased for compared to due to the severe economic conditions in the united states 
however the us ltl business unit increased its market share  achieving sequential quarter over quarter growth in daily shipments for the first three quarters of and finally quarter over prior year quarter growth in daily shipments for the fourth quarter these market share gains are the result of an integrated operating platform that was launched in the fourth quarter of allowing the us ltl business unit to offer seamless service to its customer across all ltl segment operating regions 
as a result of this integration  the length of haul increased at december  compared to december  the increase in length of haul therefore resulted in an increase in revenue per hundredweight exclusive of fuel surcharge in the comparable years 
however  the continued slowdown in the economic environment further destabilized the north american ltl pricing environment offsetting the improvement in revenue per hundredweight 
in addition to the aforementioned improvement in daily activity levels  the ltl segment made additional enhancements early in the second quarter re engineering its linehaul and pick up and delivery operations to reduce claims expenses  dock handling costs and linehaul expenses 
on april   the company announced a reduction in wages and salaries for all employees 
these initiatives resulted in an improvement in the fourth quarter results as the ltl segment posted an operating ratio of compared to an operating ratio of in the fourth quarter of management believes that with the new integrated us ltl operating model  the current sales momentum and additional operating initiatives  the segment is well positioned to contribute income from operations over the long term 
supply chain operation revenue for the sco segment decreased by to million compared to million in however  the sco segment posted record income from operations of million  a increase over the increase in income from operations for can be attributed to a full year of activity from the  square foot dedicated distribution facility added in june in toronto  canada  plus two new dedicated facilities added in sco added a  square foot dedicated distribution facility in southern california and a  square foot dedicated distribution facility in san antonio  texas 
these three significant additions within the sco segment offset retail industry weakness in and contributed to the record income from operations 
as at december   the sco segment had approximately million square feet under management compared to million square feet under management at december  it is the company s expectation to increase the square footage under management in and maximize existing capacity to increase revenue and income from operations 
notes refer to note in item selected financial data a shipment is a single movement of goods from a point of origin to its final destination as described on a bill of lading document 
weight represents the total pounds shipped by each ltl business unit 
revenue per shipment represents revenue divided by the number of shipments 
revenue per hundredweight is the price obtained for transporting pounds of ltl freight from point to point  calculated by dividing the revenue for an ltl shipment by the hundredweight weight in pounds divided by for a shipment 
adjusted net income is a non gaap measure that allows the company to evaluate its performance by removing non recurring charges to net income 
the reconciliation to net income and earnings per share excluding the goodwill impairment charge and write off of previously deferred financing costs is as follows

the reconciliation to ltl segment income from operations excluding the goodwill impairment charge is as follows year ended december  income from operations goodwill impairment adjusted income from operations liquidity and capital resources cash flow from continuing operations increased to million in compared to million in the increase is attributable to an increase in profitability  as described in the consolidated and segmented results section of the md a  the add back for loss on discontinued operations and an improvement in the change in non cash working capital 
the improvement in non cash working capital was the result of a reduction in prepaids and inventory at december  accounts receivable  the critical influencer for working capital changes at a transportation company  increased at december  compared to december  due to an approximate increase in the fourth quarter revenue compared to the same period in although revenue increased  the company s average days sales outstanding dso fell to days compared to days at december  however the average dso remains above our historical average of approximately days 
management believes the current average dso of approximately days to be a temporary anomaly associated with the lackluster economy 
it is management s objective to return dso to its historical levels of approximately days over the next twelve months if the economic environment returns to normal 
we do not believe there will be a material impact to the financial position or liquidity of the company

table of contents the company has estimated its interest obligation on its fixed and variable rate obligations 
for fixed rate debt where variable to fixed interest rate swaps are in place  the fixed interest rate was used to determine the interest obligation until the interest rate swaps mature 
for other fixed rate debt  the fixed rate was used to determine the interest rate obligation 
for variable rate debt  the variable rate in place at december  was used to determine the total interest obligation 
in addition to the above noted contractual obligations  as at december   the company utilized the revolving credit facility for standby letters of credit of million 
the letters of credit are used as collateral for self insured retention of insurance claims 
export development canada edc  a crown corporation wholly owned by the government of canada  provides guarantees up to million on loc s to the company s syndicated lenders 
in so doing the company s definition of funded debt in the associated credit agreement was amended to exclude loc s guaranteed by the edc 
a significant decrease in demand for our services could limit the company s ability to generate cash flow and affect its profitability 
the company s credit agreement contains certain financial maintenance tests that require the company to achieve stated levels of financial performance  which  if not achieved  could cause an acceleration of the payment schedules 
should the current macro economic environment further destabilize  the company may fail to comply with the aforementioned debt covenants within the next twelve months 
in this event  the company may seek to amend the debt covenants in its existing syndicated credit agreement 
management does not anticipate a significant decline in business levels or financial performance and expects that existing working capital  together with available revolving facilities  will be sufficient to fund operating and capital requirements in as well as service the contractual obligations 
outlook the fiscal year was another challenging year as the company and the economy in the united states began to creep out of the devastating freight recession of and vitran financially rebounded posting net income from continuing operations  significantly reduced debt and improved operating metrics in its segments 
the us ltl business unit significantly improved yield throughout  while gaining market share in an industry that still has overcapacity lingering 
the ltl segment plans to continue to pursue revenue and cost strategies aimed at improving service  building density at reasonable prices  reducing maintenance costs and improving productivity while not forsaking the safety culture of the company 
management s expectation is that the ltl segment s pricing initiatives will outpace its market share gains in the sco segment plans to continue to pursue new business opportunities that will maximize its existing infrastructure or expand the square footage under management 
furthermore  the sco segment plans to continue to introduce its existing and potential client base to the services of the ltl segment to further align the company s customers with the company s product offerings 
should the company close the proposed purchase of the assets of milan express s ltl division  management believes that the associated freight density would be immediately accretive to earnings  and that the new southern states of alabama  georgia  mississippi  north carolina and south carolina would provide new cross selling opportunities to increase revenue 
management believes that more so than ever  the company  on a consolidated basis  is positioned to benefit from continued improvement in the economic environment should it materialize  however  should the economy worsen  it will be necessary for management to continually adjust its strategies and tactics to minimize the impact on the company  its employees and its shareholders 
critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition the company s ltl and freight brokerage operations recognize revenue upon the delivery of the related freight and direct shipment costs as incurred 
for the ltl segment transportation services not completed at the end of a reporting period  revenue is recognized based on relative transit time in each period with expenses recognized as incurred 
revenue for the sco segment is recognized as the management services 
table of contents are provided 
critical revenue related policies and estimates for the company s ltl business unit relate to revenue adjustments and allowance for doubtful accounts 
critical revenue related policies and estimates for the company s sco segment include allowance for doubtful accounts 
at december   the allowance for doubtful accounts was million or approximately of total trade receivables 
the company believes that its revenue recognition policies are appropriate and that its revenue related estimates and judgments provide a reasonable approximation of actual revenue earned 
estimated revenue adjustments generally  the pricing assessed by companies in the ltl business is subject to subsequent adjustments due to several factors  including weight and freight classification verifications  shipper bill of lading errors  pricing discounts and other miscellaneous revenue adjustments 
revenue adjustments are evaluated and updated based on revenue levels  current trends and historical experience 
these revenue adjustments are recorded as a reduction in revenue from operations and accrued for in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company records an allowance for doubtful accounts related to accounts receivable that may potentially be impaired 
the company s allowance is estimated by a percentage of its aged receivables reflecting the current business environment  customer and industry concentrations  and historical experience and an additional allowance for specifically identified accounts that are significantly impaired 
a change to these factors could impact the estimated allowance 
the provision for bad debts is recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses 
claims and insurance accruals claims and insurance accruals reflect the estimated ultimate total cost of claims  including amounts for claims incurred but not reported and future claims development  for cargo loss and damage  bodily injury and property damage  workers compensation  long term disability and group health 
in establishing these accrued expenses  management evaluates and monitors each claim individually and claim frequency 
factors such as historical experience  known trends and third party estimates help determine the appropriate reserves for the estimated liability 
changes in severity of previously reported claims  significant changes in the medical costs and legislative changes affecting the administration of the plans could significantly impact the determination of appropriate reserves in future periods 
in canada  the company has a  deductible and in the united states  self insurance retention sir per incident for auto liability  casualty and cargo claims 
in the united states  the company has a  sir per incident for workers compensation and  sir per incident for employee medical 
in addition to estimates within the self insured retention  management makes judgments concerning the coverage limits 
if any claim was to exceed the coverage limits  the company would have to accrue for the excess amount 
the estimate would include evaluation whether a claim may exceed such limits and  if so  by how much 
a claim or group of claims of this nature could have a material adverse effect on the company s results from operations 
currently management is not aware of any claims exceeding the coverage limit 
goodwill and intangible assets the company performs its goodwill impairment test annually and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have occurred 
impairment is tested at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit s carrying amount to its implied fair value 
the methodology used to measure fair value is a discounted cash flow method which is an income approach  and a market approach which estimates fair value using market multiples of appropriate financial measures compared to a set of comparable public companies in the transportation and logistics industry 
the fair value methods require certain assumptions for growth in earnings before interest  taxes and depreciation  future tax rates  capital re investment  fair value of the assets and liabilities  and discount rate 
actual impairment of goodwill could differ from these assumptions based on market conditions and other factors 
in the event goodwill is determined to be impaired  a charge to earnings would be required 
as at september   vitran completed its annual goodwill impairment test and concluded that there was no impairment 

table of contents one of the indicators of impairment is a sustained decline in the company s share price whereby the market capitalization of the company is less than its book value for an extended period of time 
at december   before recording goodwill impairment charges  the carrying value of vitran s net assets was million compared to the market capitalization of all of the company s outstanding shares which was million 
the market valuation of the company declined during the fourth quarter as vitran s share price on the nasdaq stock market decreased from at september  to at december  these factors and the depressed macroeconomic environment indicated a triggering event had occurred requiring the company  at a reporting unit level  to test for the impairment of goodwill at december  using the income and market approach for estimating the fair value of each reporting unit  management concluded that the goodwill in its ltl segment was impaired and there was no impairment of goodwill in its other reporting units 
therefore  vitran recorded a pre tax non cash goodwill impairment charge of million at december  property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
management establishes appropriate useful lives for all property and equipment based upon  among other considerations  historical experience  change in equipment manufacturing specifications  the used equipment market and prevailing industry practice 
management continually monitors events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amounts of property and equipment may not be recoverable 
when indicators of potential impairment are present  the recoverability of the assets would be assessed from the estimated undiscounted future operating cash flows expected from the use of the assets 
actual recoverability of assets could differ based on different assumptions  estimates or other factors 
in the event that recoverability was impaired  the fair value of the asset would be recorded and an impairment loss would be recognized 
management believes its estimates of useful lives and salvage values have been reasonable as demonstrated by the insignificant amounts of gains and losses on revenue equipment dispositions 
share based compensation under the company s stock option plan  options to purchase common shares of the company may be granted to key employees  officers and directors of the company and its affiliates by the board of directors or by the company s compensation committee 
the company accounts for stock options in accordance with fasb asc with compensation expense amortized over the vesting period based on the black scholes merton fair value on the grant date 
the assumptions used to value stock options are dividend yield  expected volatility  risk free interest rate  expected life and anticipated forfeiture 
the company does not pay any dividends on its common shares  therefore the dividend yield is zero 
we use the historical method to calculate volatility with the historical period being equal to the expected life of each option 
this calculation is then used to approximate the potential for the share price to increase over the expected life of the option 
the risk free interest rate is based on the government of canada issued bond rate in effect at the time of the grant 
expected life represents the length of time the option is estimated to be outstanding before being exercised or forfeited 
historical information is used to determine the forfeiture rate 
income taxes the company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under the asset and liability method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the deferred tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
significant judgment is required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part 
if it were ever estimated that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets will not be realized  a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of deferred tax assets that is estimated not to be realized 
a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of million was established at december  accordingly  if the facts or financial results were to change  thereby impacting the likelihood of realizing the deferred tax assets  judgment would have to be applied to estimate the amount of valuation allowance required in any given period 

table of contents fasb asc requires that uncertain tax positions are evaluated in a two step process  whereby the company determines whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position and for those tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold  the company would recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority 
management judgment is also required regarding a variety of other factors  including the appropriateness of tax strategies  expected future tax consequences  and to the extent tax strategies are challenged by taxing authorities 
we utilize certain income tax planning strategies to reduce our overall cost of income taxes 
it is possible that certain strategies might be disallowed  resulting in an increased liability for income taxes 
significant management judgments are involved in assessing the likelihood of sustaining the strategies and an ultimate result worse than our expectations could adversely affect our results of operations 
in  the company completed audits with the internal revenue service and canada customs and revenue agency without material consequences

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes 
the company s exposure to changes in interest rates is limited to borrowings under the term bank facilities and revolving credit facilities that have variable interest rates tied to the libor rate 
as a majority of the company s debt is tied to variable interest rates  we estimate that the fair value of the long term debt approximates the carrying value

to value the interest rate swaps  a discounted cash flow model is utilized 
primary inputs into the model that will cause the fair value to fluctuate period to period include the fixed interest rates  the future interest rates  credit risk and the remaining time to maturity of the interest rate swaps 
management s intention is to hold the interest rate swaps to maturity 
the company is exposed to foreign currency risk as fluctuations in the united states dollar against the canadian dollar can impact the financial results of the company 
the company s canadian operations realize foreign currency exchange gains and losses on the united states dollar denominated revenue generated against canadian dollar denominated expenses
