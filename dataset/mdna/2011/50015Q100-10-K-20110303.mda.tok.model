item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial information in item above and our historical consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this form k 
overview and key developments we are an independent energy company focused on the exploration  exploitation  acquisition and production of natural gas and crude oil in the united states 
our oil and natural gas reserves and operations are primarily concentrated in the williston basin of north dakota and montana and in the green river basin of wyoming and colorado 
kodiak historic focus has been to internally identify prospects  acquire lands encompassing those prospects and evaluate those prospects using subsurface geology and geophysical data and exploratory drilling 
we have developed an oil and natural gas asset base of proved reserves  as well as a portfolio of development and exploratory drilling opportunities on high potential conventional and non conventional oil and natural gas prospects that we have the opportunity to explore  drill and develop 
we will continue to evaluate and invest in acquisitions and internally generated prospects to increase the value of the company 
smokey polar acquisition on november   we closed the acquisition of oil and gas properties located in the areas known as the smokey and polar prospects 
the acquisition  comprised of producing properties and undeveloped leasehold  together with various other related permits  contracts  equipment  data and other assets  is located in mckenzie  williams and divide counties of north dakota 
we funded the cash purchase price of million with cash on hand and borrowings under an expanded revolving credit facility and a new second lien term loan 
as a result of this acquisition  we acquired  gross mineral acres  net in mckenzie county and  gross  net mineral acres in northern williams county and southern divide county 
the mckenzie county acreage includes four producing wellbores and associated equipment  three of which are operated by us 
in mckenzie county  we acquired an approximate working interest and a net revenue interest in the acquired leasehold and subsequently purchased the remaining working interest from unrelated parties 
in the williams and divide lands  we acquired a working interest and net revenue interest in the acquired leasehold 
because of our high working interest on this leasehold  we expect to operate the majority of the drilling units that will be comprised of this acreage 
drilling and completions as of december   we had total gross net wells on production  of which net wells are kodiak operated and net wells are in the williston basin of north dakota and montana primarily in the bakken 
during  we participated in drilling gross wells  and we have completed gross net as producers 
this compares to gross net wells drilled and gross net wells completed in six gross wells were waiting on completion at year end and have either been scheduled for completion during early or are part of multi well pads that are expected to be completed after all the wells have been drilled on each shared pad 
eleven of the wells completed in are kodiak operated  four of which were completed with lateral lengths greater than  feet 
in  the focus of our drilling and completion activity in the bakken was to continue to improve on the performance and resulting financial returns of our wells primarily by modifying our completion process 
as compared to  we used larger volumes of proppants  tighter spacing and more fracture 
table of contents stimulation frac stages and improved gel designs 
we believe that these efforts have improved our wells performance as suggested by the increased production over their early life 
the graph below compares bakken wells that were completed in to bakken wells that were completed in under comparable conditions with the exception of the changes in technique discussed above 
although the population is a limited number of wells wells in and in  and although the comparison relates only to the initial production of the wells  we believe the comparison suggests the potential impact that our improved techniques may have had on well performance 
in the three longer laterals drilled and completed in we averaged boepd for the first days of production for a cumulative average total boe of  this compares to two longer laterals completed in the third quarter of that averaged boepd for the first days of production or a cumulative average total of  boe 
likewise we have experienced the same improvement with our shorter laterals 
we completed five shorter laterals in and early which averaged boepd for the first days of production for an average cumulative production of  boe 
we completed three wells with similar length of laterals in and achieved average production rates of boepd and cumulative production of  boe in the first days of production 
completion techniques have been and will continue to be evaluated with the expectation of further enhancing our completion methods as more data becomes available 
production comparison representative long and short lateral wells graphic long laterals completed in have not reached days in production history 
as we continue to develop the bakken  we will predominantly drill long horizontal laterals up to  feet on  acre drilling blocks and utilize multi well pads 
we believe that we achieve stronger internal rates of return on our wells with long laterals as compared to those with short laterals 
multi well pads allow us to efficiently drill  complete and operate our wells and reduce costs with fewer rig mobilizations  while also minimizing the impact on the surface locations 
all of the gross operated wells budgeted for are expected to have longer horizontal laterals 

table of contents another key focus of our oil and gas operations was to further evaluate the density of drilling and the potential of the three forks formation 
during  we completed wells on our dunn county acreage in the middle bakken formation with laterals approximately  feet apart from each other 
testing indicated very little communication during the fracture stimulation and no change in production rates was evident 
this work supports our belief that these lands can be developed with four wells per drilling unit 
late in  we partially completed our first well in the three forks formation on our dunn county leasehold 
while only six of the anticipated stages are completed due to a leak in the frac string that was subsequently repaired  early results were indicative of the high potential of the formation and very little communication with the middle bakken reservoir  suggesting separate reservoirs 
we plan to complete the remaining stages of the well in early although we have not tested the density of wells in the three forks formation  the general belief based upon industry activity is that the three forks formation could support three to four wells within a drilling unit 
we are testing these same spacing patterns in mckenzie county and expect to have additional information later in the year 
one key part of our exploration and development program has been the use of pad drilling 
starting in  we are now drilling up to four wells from each pad and we believe that  in future years  the number of wells off of each pad could grow 
the significance of pad drilling is primarily directed to mobilization and demobilization of our drilling rigs 
as the industry is facing a shortage of services  the use of pad drilling has become even more important as it lowers the number of moves required between wells  eliminating the need for trucks to move the equipment which are in tight demand 
furthermore  we believe we will see some efficiencies in our completion work as we can eliminate mobilization and demobilization time for our pressure pumping company allowing it more efficient use of its time 
in  we plan to drill all wells from two well to four well pads 
our williston basin leasehold is largely contiguous and by virtue of our high working interest and operatorship  we are generally able to control the development pace and location of surface facilities 
this strategy  combined with pad drilling and long laterals  will maximize the efficiency of our drilling program and minimize the infrastructure required to connect our wells to sales pipelines 
as a result  we plan our locations to minimize the number of wells required to hold our acreage by establishing production within the primary terms of our leases 
oil and gas reserves as of december   we had estimated proved reserves of million barrels mmbbls of oil and billion cubic feet bcf of natural gas with a present value discounted at of million  before income tax effect  or million after the effect of income taxes 
our reserves are comprised of crude oil and natural gas on an energy equivalent basis 
this is an increase of over our crude oil reserves and over our natural gas reserves 
all of our reserves are located within the continental united states with in the williston basin in north dakota and montana 
netherland sewell associates  inc netherland  our independent petroleum engineering consulting firm  prepared our estimated reserves as of december   and reserve estimates are inherently imprecise and remain subject to revisions based on production history  results of additional exploration and development drilling  results of secondary and tertiary recovery applications  prevailing oil and natural gas prices  and other factors 
you should read the notes following the table below and the information following the notes to our 
table of contents audited financial statements for the years ended december  and included in this form k in conjunction with the following reserve estimates as of december  proved developed oil reserves thousands of barrels  or mbbls proved undeveloped oil reserves mbbls total proved oil reserves mbbls proved developed gas reserves million cubic feet  or mmcf proved undeveloped gas reserves mmcf total proved gas reserves mmcf total proved gas equivalents million cubic feet equivalent  or mmcfe total proved oil equivalents thousands of barrels equivalent  or mboe present value of estimated future net revenues after income taxes  discounted at we converted oil to mcf of gas equivalent at a ratio of one barrel to six mcf 
we calculated the present value of estimated future net revenues as of december  and using the month arithmetic average first of month price january through december for the respective years 
the average resulting price used as of december  was per mcf for natural gas and per barrel of oil 
the average resulting price used as of december  was per mcf for natural gas and per barrel of oil

the completed wells include five wells targeting the middle bakken formation with longer laterals over  feet and four middle bakken wells with shorter laterals 
when we began drilling operations in the williston basin in and  most of our wells were drilled with lateral lengths less than  feet 
as we continued into  we changed our drilling to include almost entirely longer laterals 
as we look to  we expect to be drilling all longer laterals 
also included are five wells drilled by third parties in which we have small non operated interests and one well completed in sheridan county  montana that produces from the red river formation 
largely as a result of our extensive drilling program  we increased the number of proved undeveloped pud locations from at year end to at year end these pud locations are in offsetting drilling units to our producing wells or the producing wells of other operators 
although we believe our drilling and completion activity in late demonstrates the 
table of contents viability of multiple locations per drilling unit in the middle bakken formation particularly on our dunn county leasehold where we have completed tighter density drilling  we have limited our pud reserves to one location per drilling unit pending additional production history from wells in this area 
the increased number of pud locations is also a reflection of our increasing rig count 
during  we operated one drilling rig 
in early  we brought in a second operated rig and then late in our joint venture partner brought in its first rig resulting in three drilling rigs which are drilling lands where we have significant working interests 
in  we have scheduled a third operated rig to commence drilling activity in the first quarter 
we have not included material reserves for the three forks formation as we have only recently completed a well in this formation 
however  as we project our drilling program and beyond  we are anticipating drilling one middle bakken well and one three forks well from each of our drilling pads 
our total pud reserves as of december  were mmboe  which represents of our total proved reserves as compared to at december  we had no proved undeveloped reserves at december  thus  all undeveloped reserves as of december  were primarily a result of our exploratory drilling activity 
at year end  pud reserves were attributed to gross locations 
of these gross locations  gross wells were drilled  completed and placed on production in as result of incurred expenditures of million 
these eight wells were attributed mmboe at year end and at year end  the same eight wells were estimated to have mmboe of remaining oil and gas reserves 
two of the pud locations were further expanded with two wells drilled from each pud location 
in one of these two locations  the additional well was drilled into the three forks formation 
of the seven remaining pud locations  as of january   two locations have been drilled but not completed  four locations remain undrilled but are in various stages of preparation and permit acquisition and remain classified as pud locations at year end the pud reserves on these four wells are estimated to be mmboe at year end as compared to mmboe at year end controls over reserve report preparation  technical qualifications and technologies used our year end reserve report is prepared by netherland based upon a review of property interests being appraised  production from such properties  current costs of operation and development  current prices for production  agreements relating to current and future operations and sale of production  geoscience and engineering data  and other information we provide to them

a variety of methodologies are used to determine our proved reserve estimates

some combination of these methods is used to determine reserve estimates in substantially all of our fields 
for more information regarding our oil and gas reserves  see the discussion under the heading supplemental oil and gas reserve information unaudited  following the footnotes to our financial statements in item 
table of contents oil and gas sales in  our crude oil sales averaged  barrels per day and gas sales averaged mcf per day 
this was an increase of for oil sales and a decrease of for gas sales over the volumes sold in during  our revenues from oil and gas sales increased by million or to million 
these increases are primarily due to bringing net wells on to production in in addition to commodity prices increases 
of our total increase in oil and gas sales revenue  was due to increased sales volumes and was due to commodity price increases 
total oil and gas production expenses increased to million in from million in of the million increase in  million was due to increased production taxes and million was due to higher operating costs  primarily related to the additional well count 
our revenues are directly affected by oil and natural gas commodity prices  which can fluctuate dramatically 
the commodity prices are beyond our control and are difficult to predict 
we have seen significant volatility in oil and natural gas prices in recent years 
since early  oil prices have steadily increased while natural gas prices have not increased in a similar manner 
we believe that spot market prices reflect worldwide concerns about the global economy  producers ability to ensure sufficient supply to meet increasing demand amid a host of uncertainties caused by political instability  a fluctuating us dollar  and crude oil refining and natural gas infrastructure constraints 
prices that we have historically received have varied widely depending on commodity and location of sales points 
in  we experienced improving crude oil prices in the williston basin whereas  in wyoming  we have not seen an increase in natural gas prices 
overall  the average crude oil price we received during was per barrel versus per barrel in  while our average gas price received during was per mcf compared to per mcf in outlook our board of directors approved a million capital expenditure budget for  all of which is allocated to oil and gas activities to continue to develop the bakken play in the williston basin of north dakota and montana 
as part of the total capital expenditure budget  we have allocated million to the drilling of gross net wells and completion of gross net wells on our dunn county acreage  including million for gross net non operated wells operated by our partner exxonmobil corporation 
for our mckenzie county acreage  we have allocated million for drilling nine gross net operated wells and completing gross net operated wells 
because of our predominantly contiguous leasehold  kodiak working interest averages approximately in the operated drilling program  thereby providing flexibility within the budget in identifying suitable well locations and in the timing and size of capital investment 
the capital expenditure budget is subject to revision due to market conditions  oilfield services and equipment availability  commodity prices and drilling results 
although we continue to explore opportunities to expand our acreage position  we have not allocated any of our capital budget to acquisitions 
rather  our current budget is allocated entirely to drilling and completing wells and to infrastructure costs related to connecting our wells to gathering systems 
potential leasehold acquisitions would therefore require us to adjust our budget 
kodiak expects to fund the budget from cash on hand  cash flow from operations and potential borrowings under a reserve based revolving line of credit 
we anticipate operating a three rig drilling program in the williston basin  on our acreage in dunn and mckenzie counties 
we believe our permitting procedures on the lands in dunn county will provide us with ample permits as we move through the year and we are now starting to permit our program 
permitting in other parts of north dakota is less cumbersome and time consuming and we anticipate having adequate permits for our drilling program 

table of contents our and permitting and drilling programs are designed to move all of our current acreage into held by production hbp status within the primary term of our existing leases  and we do not anticipate significant expiration issues with our leases 
during the first quarter of  we have continued to experience difficult weather conditions in the williston basin 
these conditions have caused delays in completion procedures and have also caused interruptions to our production  as oil tankers have been restricted in physically accessing our locations 
we anticipate that we can return our production to more normal levels going into the second quarter of  as not only should the weather conditions improve  but we have connected four of our wells in dunn county into pipelines and are in the final stages of connecting an additional four wells 
with that accomplished  we are able to move oil  gas and water through the pipelines which eliminates our trucking issues 
we are currently scheduled to complete two of our wells in mckenzie county in march the completion of these wells was scheduled earlier in the quarter but has been delayed due to the inclement weather 
as these wells will have few days  if any  of production in the first quarter we would expect our first quarter production to be comparable to the fourth quarter of we expect to resume our forecasted production schedule in the second quarter of as further discussed below  if our existing and potential sources of liquidity are not sufficient to undertake our currently planned expenditures  we may alter this drilling program and capital budget or pursue other sources of capital 
there can be no assurance that any such transactions can be completed or that such transactions would satisfy our operating capital requirements 
if we are not successful in obtaining sufficient funding or completing an alternative transaction on a timely basis on terms acceptable to us  we would be required to curtail this capital budget which would cause us to be unable to implement our original exploration and drilling program 
liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for each of the three years ended december   and in thousands for the years ended december  capital resources and liquidity cash and cash equivalents at end of the period net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents our primary cash requirements are for the exploration  development and acquisition of oil and gas properties 
historically  including in the last three years  we have financed our operations  property acquisitions and other capital investments from the proceeds of offerings of our equity securities  borrowings under lending arrangements with financial institutions and  more recently to a limited extent  cash generated from operations 
during  we did not generate sufficient cash flows from operations to fund our capital expenditure budget 
consequently  we undertook the following financing arrangements we conducted two equity financings of our common stock in resulting in net cash provided by financing activities of approximately million 
in the first of these financings  we issued  shares of common stock in august through a public offering for gross proceeds 
table of contents of approximately million 
in december  we issued  shares of common stock through a public offering for gross proceeds of approximately million 
in may  we established a million revolving line of credit with wells fargo bank  na the borrowing base  reflecting the maximum amount that may be outstanding under the credit facility  was initially million and subsequently increased to million in november this facility  which is currently undrawn  expires under its terms in may  unless the term is extended 
for further details on the revolving line of credit see note credit agreement under item in this report 
in november  we established a million second lien facility with wells fargo energy capital  inc  which is fully drawn as of december  and expires under its terms in november this facility has provision for early payment after one year from inception  or november such early payment would require varying premiums to be paid over the principal amount 
although we anticipate holding the outstanding borrowing to expiration  we may pre pay after the one year period depending on our then existing liquidity position 
changes to our liquidity that may motivate us to pre pay this debt include increased operating cash flows and the ability to replace this debt with cash obtained through equity offerings or other long term debt 
for further details on the second lien facility see note credit agreement under item in this report 
we are subject to restrictive covenants under each of our revolving line of credit and second lien facility 
the ability to maintain these facilities and borrow additional funds is dependent on a number of variables  including our proved reserves  and assumptions regarding the price at which oil and natural gas can be sold 
as of december   we had working capital of million  no outstanding borrowings under our revolving line of credit  a balance on our second lien loan of million  and other significant obligations in respect of both our office lease and our three drilling rig contracts see the discussion under the heading contractual obligations below 
our working capital as of december  included million of cash and million of prepaid tubular goods to be used in our drilling program 
we believe our cash flows from operations  our existing working capital and increases in our borrowing base  if necessary and available  will be sufficient to meet our planned capital expenditure budget 
if our existing and potential sources of liquidity were not to be sufficient to undertake our currently planned expenditures or any revisions thereto  we may alter our drilling program  pursue joint ventures with third parties  sell interest in one or more of our properties or sell securities of the company 
there can be no assurance that any such transactions can be completed or that such transactions would satisfy our operating capital requirements 
if we are not successful in obtaining sufficient funding or completing an alternative transaction on a timely basis on terms acceptable to us  we would be required to curtail our planned expenditures or restructure our operations  and we would be unable to implement our original exploration and drilling program 
as we operate the majority of our acreage  specifically our williston acreage  we have the ability to adjust our drilling schedule to reflect the changing commodity price or oil field service environment 
should we reduce our ownership and relinquish the right to operate certain properties  we would become subject to obligations imposed by others  without the ability to control our drilling schedule 
our increase in cash provided by operations from to is directly related to the successful drilling and completion operations accomplished during and our production and resulting revenue has increased as each well has been turned to production 
in addition to the increase in the number of wells on production  the initial per well production has increased for our recently added wells 

table of contents excluding the smokey polar acquisition in the fourth quarter of  our principal investing activities during the three years ended december  related primarily to the addition of oil and gas leases and oil and gas drilling activities 
we recorded million in development and exploration costs in as compared to million in and million in operating results production and sales volumes  average sales prices  and production costs the bakken is the only field as such term is used within the meaning of applicable regulations of the sec that contains more than of our total proved reserves 
at december   this field contained of our total proved reserves  nearly all of which are located in dunn and mckenzie counties 
the following table discloses our oil and gas production and sales volumes from the bakken field  from our other fields combined and in total  for the periods indicated for the years ended december  december  december  sales volume bakken gas mcf oil bbls sales volume other gas mcf oil bbls sales volume total gas mcf oil bbls sales volumes boe production from acquisition august november  gas mcf oil bbls natural gas flared mcf total production bakken gas mcf oil bbls total production other gas mcf oil bbls total production volume gas mcf oil bbls production volumes boe includes production on acquired properties for periods prior to the closing date of the transaction but subsequent to the effective date

all such volumes are related to the bakken field

all flared gas is related to the bakken field 
beginning in late  we began connecting previously flared gas into 
table of contents gas pipelines for delivery to markets 
a majority of our natural gas is expected to be connected by the end of sales prices received  and production costs per sold boe for the years ended december   and are summarized in the following table for the years ended december  december  december  sales price gas mcf oil bbls commodity price risk management activities sales boe realized loss unrealized loss production costs sales boe lease operating expenses production and property taxes gathering  transportation  marketing year ended december  compared to year ended december  oil sales revenues 
oil sales revenues increased by million to million for the year ended december  as compared to oil sales of million for the year ended december  our oil sales volume increased to thousand barrels mbbls in as compared to mbbls in the increased revenue from oil sales in is attributed to a million positive impact due to increased volumes 
additionally  the average price we realized on the sale of our oil increased from per barrel for the year ended december   to for the year ended december  resulting in a positive impact of million in revenue 
natural gas sales revenues 
natural gas sales volumes decreased by  mcf to  mcf for the year ended december  the average price we realized on the sale of our natural gas was per mcf in compared to per mcf in the increase in natural gas prices realized resulted in a  increase in natural gas revenue while the decline in natural gas volumes resulted in a decline in natural gas revenue by  for total increase of our gas sales revenue of approximately  the decline in our natural gas sales volumes is largely a result of our focus on the development of our bakken properties as opposed to our wyoming assets that historically have contributed a majority of our natural gas production 
although our bakken wells do produce associated gas  to date most of this gas has been flared 
late in  we began connecting our wells to third party pipelines that will gather and transport the gas to processing plants and sales pipelines 
we expect that a majority of our remaining wells will be connected to gas pipelines during which will allow us to capture the related sales revenue 
loss on commodity price risk management activities 
for the twelve months ended december  we incurred a total loss on our risk management activities of million 
this loss is a result of our hedging program used to mitigate our exposure to commodity price fluctuations that may inhibit our ability to fund our capital expenditure budget or other obligations 
this loss was comprised of approximately  of realized losses for transactions that were settled in the fourth quarter of and million of unrealized losses for the mark to market of forward transactions 
the unrealized loss is a non cash adjustment for the value of our risk management transactions at december  these transactions will continue to change in value and we will likely add to our 
table of contents hedging program 
therefore we expect our net income to reflect the volatility of commodity price forward markets 
our cash flows will only be affected upon settlement of the transactions at the current market prices at that time 
oil and gas production expense 
our oil and gas production expense increased by million to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in the increase is primarily due to a million increase in production taxes and a million increase in lease operating expenses loe 
the production tax increase is attributable to increased revenue as it is calculated as a fixed percentage of sales revenue 
loe increased year over year due to a higher number of wells that we operate or participate in 
on a per unit basis  loe increased from per barrel sold in to in this increase is related to higher operating costs primarily in our williston basin activities 
the largest cost driver in our williston basin operations is the disposal of water used in the well completion operations 
we expense the water handling costs once oil production is established 
to date  this water has been transported by truck to third party disposal facilities 
late in  we began connecting our wells to third party pipelines that will transport water directly to disposal facilities 
we expect that a majority of our remaining wells will be connected to water pipelines during  which will substantially reduce our water related costs 
depletion  depreciation  amortization and abandonment liability accretion dda expense 
our depletion  depreciation  amortization and abandonment liability accretion expense increased by million to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in this increase is due to increased volumes sold in as sales increased by approximately  boe 
on a per unit basis  dda increased from approximately per barrel sold in to per barrel sold in this increase is primarily due to increased well costs as compared to reserves as estimated in our annual reserve report 
in  we have predominantly completed our wells using a greater number of fracture stimulation stages and increased volumes of proppant 
these factors have increased the well completion costs but we believe that the higher upfront costs will generate overall higher returns through greater production volumes and total oil and gas reserves 
currently  because of the early stages of development of our bakken play  our reserves include the increased well costs but not the improved reserves 
we believe that as our improved results are reflected in our future estimated reserves  the dda rate per unit will decrease over time 
general and administrative g a expense 
general and administrative expense increased by million to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in this increase is due to the growth in personnel and related costs as we have expanded our operational activities 
total employees have increased to at year end from at year end also contributing to the increase are costs associated with the smokey polar acquisition in the fourth quarter under accounting standard codification  asc  our acquisition related costs of approximately  were expensed to g a expense 
our g a expense includes the non cash expense for stock based compensation for stock options and share grants under our stock incentive plan 
for the twelve months ended december   this expense was million as compared to million in approximately  of the year over year increase was due to the use of shares of common stock in lieu of cash for a portion of the executive bonus award 
net loss 
our net loss was approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to a net loss of million for although our revenue  net of production expenses  was higher compared to  our net loss was negatively impacted by increased dda  g a and  most significantly  the loss on risk management activities discussed above

oil sales revenues increased by million to a record million for the year ended december  as compared to oil sales of million for the year ended december  our oil sales volume increased in as compared to the increased revenue in is attributed to a million positive impact due to increased volumes 
however  the average price we realized on the sale of our oil decreased from per barrel for the year ended december   to for the year ended december  therefore  a negative impact of million is attributed to the decline in oil price in as compared to natural gas sales revenues 
natural gas sales revenues decreased by  to  for the year ended december   from million for the same period of the average price we realized on the sale of our natural gas was per mcf in compared to per mcf in this decline in natural gas prices realized resulted in a  decline in natural gas revenue in as compared to natural gas sales volumes were  mcf for the year ended december   compared to  mcf for the same period in this increase in natural gas volumes partially offset the decline in natural gas revenue by  interest and other income 
interest and other income decreased by  to  in from  for the same period in due to both a decrease in average investible cash throughout the year and lower interest rate paid for funds held with our banks 
oil and gas production expense 
our oil and gas production expense decreased by million to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in the decrease is primarily due to workover expense of million recorded in which was partially offset by additional production expense attributable to each new well coming on to production during depletion  depreciation  amortization and abandonment liability accretion dda expense 
our depletion  depreciation  amortization and abandonment liability accretion expense decreased by million to million for the fiscal year ended december   from million for the same period in although increased production volumes impact dda by increasing cost on a units of production basis  due to impairment charges taken in  the full cost pool was lower resulting in a lower dda rate charged for asset impairment 
there were no asset impairment charges during during the last half of  crude oil and natural gas prices dropped from their highs set in the summer of and the company full cost pool exceeded the ceiling by approximately million after taking into account decrease in prices following the period ends 
subsequent to the end of the third and fourth quarters of  there was no recovery in price and therefore impairment expenses of million and million were recorded in the third and fourth quarters of  respectively 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense increased by  to million for the fiscal year ended december   from million for the same period in excluding the non cash stock based compensation expense in each period our general and administrative expenses increased by  or during as compared to the same period in we recorded lower stock based compensation expense of approximately million for the year ended december  compared to million recorded for the same period in  related to options and restricted stock issued to officers  directors and employees 
the reduction in the stock based compensation expense is due in part to the reversal recorded of non vested performance based stock options that expired as of march  stock based compensation expense related to the expired performance based stock options was approximately  additionally  on december  certain officers and directors voluntarily cancelled stock options issued in the 
table of contents unamortized expense related to these cancelled options of approximately  was recognized in stock based compensation expense as of december  net loss 
our net loss improved or decreased by million to a net loss of million for the year ended december   from a net loss of million for as more fully described above  the asset impairment of million in was the primary cause of the decrease in net loss from in addition  our increased oil production and resulting oil revenue contributed to the improvement or decrease in net loss 
financial instruments and other instruments as of december   we had cash  accounts payable and accrued liabilities which are carried at approximate fair value because of the short maturity date of those instruments 
additionally  at december   we had derivative instruments see note to financial statements  and long term debt discussed below recorded at fair value

if the company does not meet such commitments  the acreage positions or wells may be lost 
we have not included asset retirement obligations as discussed in note of the accompanying audited financial statements  as we cannot determine with accuracy the timing of such payments 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  or gaap  requires our management to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the following is a summary of the significant accounting policies and related estimates that affect our financial disclosures 
derivative instruments during  the company has entered in to swaps and no premium collars to reduce the effect of price changes on a portion of our future oil production 
we reflect the fair market value of our derivative instruments on our balance sheet 
our estimates of fair value are determined by obtaining independent market quotes  as well as utilizing a black scholes option valuation model that is based upon underlying forward price curve data  risk free interest rates  credit adjusted discount rates and estimated volatility factors 
changes in commodity prices will result in substantially similar changes in the fair value of our commodity derivative agreements  and in substantially similar changes in the fair value of our commodity collars to the extent the changes are outside the floor or cap of our collars 
we do not apply hedge accounting to any of our derivative contracts  therefore we recognize mark to market gains and losses in earnings currently 
business combinations in november  the asc guidance for business combinations was updated to provide new guidance for recognizing and measuring the assets and goodwill acquired and liabilities assumed in an acquisition 
the updated guidance also broadened the definition of a business combination and requires an entity to recognize transaction costs separately from the acquisition 
the company adopted the updated guidance effective january  and applied it to the acquisition of its bakken properties acquisition completed on november  see note 
oil and natural gas reserves we follow the full cost method of accounting 
all of our oil and gas properties are located within the united states  and therefore all costs related to the acquisition and development of oil and gas properties are capitalized into a single cost center referred to as a full cost pool 
depletion of exploration and development costs and depreciation of production equipment is computed using the units of production method based upon estimated proved oil and gas reserves 
under the full cost method of accounting  capitalized oil and gas property costs less accumulated depletion and net of deferred income taxes may not exceed an amount equal to the present value  discounted at  of estimated future net revenues from proved oil and gas reserves less the future cash outflows associated with the asset retirement obligations that have been accrued on the balance sheet plus the cost  or estimated fair value if lower  of unproved properties 
should capitalized costs exceed this ceiling  impairment would be recognized 
under the sec rules  we prepared our oil and gas reserve estimates as of december  and  using the average  first day of the month price during the month period ending december  in prior years  we used the year end or quarter ended price 
prior to december   subsequent commodity price increases could be utilized to calculate the ceiling value 
estimating accumulations of gas and oil is complex and is not exact because of the numerous uncertainties inherent in the process 
the process relies on interpretations of available geological  geophysical  engineering and production data 
the extent  quality and reliability of this technical data can vary 
the process also requires certain economic assumptions  some of which are mandated by the sec  such as gas and oil prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and 
table of contents availability of funds 
the accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of the quality and quantity of available data  the interpretation of that data  the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions  and the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate 
we believe estimated reserve quantities and the related estimates of future net cash flows are the most important estimates made by an exploration and production company such as ours because they affect the perceived value of our company  are used in comparative financial analysis ratios  and are used as the basis for the most significant accounting estimates in our financial statements  including the quarterly calculation of depletion  depreciation and impairment of our proved oil and natural gas properties 
proved oil and natural gas reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas  and natural gas liquids that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future periods from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
we determine anticipated future cash inflows and future production and development costs by applying benchmark prices and costs  including transportation  quality and basis differentials  in effect at the end of each quarter to the estimated quantities of oil and natural gas remaining to be produced as of the end of that quarter 
we reduce expected cash flows to present value using a discount rate that depends upon the purpose for which the reserve estimates will be used 
for example  the standardized measure calculation required by asc topic  extractive activities oil and gas  requires us to apply a discount rate 
although reserve estimates are inherently imprecise  and estimates of new discoveries and undeveloped locations are more imprecise than those of established proved producing oil and natural gas properties  we make considerable effort to estimate our reserves  including through the use of independent reserves engineering consultants 
we expect that quarterly reserve estimates will change in the future as additional information becomes available or as oil and natural gas prices and operating and capital costs change 
we evaluate and estimate our oil and natural gas reserves as of december of each year and quarterly throughout the year 
for purposes of depletion  depreciation  and impairment  we adjust reserve quantities at all quarterly periods for the estimated impact of acquisitions and dispositions 
changes in depletion  depreciation or impairment calculations caused by changes in reserve quantities or net cash flows are recorded in the period in which the reserves or net cash flow estimate changes 
impairment of long lived assets we record our property and equipment at cost 
the cost of our unproved properties is withheld from the depletion base as described above  until such a time as the properties are either developed or abandoned 
we review these properties quarterly for possible impairment 
we provide an impairment allowance on unproved property when we determine that the property will not be developed or the carrying value will not be realized 
we evaluate the reliability of our proved properties and other long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the recording of impairment may be appropriate 
our impairment test compares the expected undiscounted future net revenue from a property  using escalated pricing  with the related net capitalized costs of the property at the end of the applicable period 
when the net capitalized costs exceed the undiscounted future net revenue of a property  the cost of the property is added to the full cost pool 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policy is significant because revenue is a key component of our results of operations and of the forward looking statements contained in our analysis of liquidity and capital resources 
we derive our revenue primarily from the sale of produced natural gas and crude oil 
we report revenue as the gross amounts we receive before taking into account production taxes and transportation costs  which are reported as separate expenses 
we record revenue in the month our production is delivered to the purchaser  but payment is generally received to days after the date of production 
at the end of each month  we make estimates of the amount of production that we delivered to the purchaser and the price we will receive 
we use our knowledge of our properties  their 
table of contents historical performance  the anticipated effect of weather conditions during the month of production  nymex and local spot market prices and other factors as the basis for these estimates 
we record the variances between our estimates and the actual amounts we receive in the month payment is received 
asset retirement obligations we are required to recognize an estimated liability for future costs associated with the abandonment of our oil and gas properties including without limitation the costs of reclamation of our drilling sites  storage and transmission facilities and access roads 
we base our estimate of the liability on the industry experience of our management and on our current understanding of federal and state regulatory requirements 
our present value calculations require us to estimate the economic lives of our properties  assume what future inflation rates apply to external estimates and determine the credit adjusted risk free rate to use 
our estimated asset retirement obligations are reflected in our depreciation  depletion and amortization calculations over the remaining life of our oil and gas properties 
oil and natural gas properties full cost method of accounting we use the full cost method of accounting whereby all costs related to the acquisition and development of oil and natural gas properties are capitalized into a single cost center referred to as a full cost pool 
these costs include land acquisition costs  geological and geophysical expenses  carrying charges on non producing properties  costs of drilling and overhead charges directly related to acquisition and exploration activities 
capitalized costs  together with the costs of production equipment  are depleted and amortized on the unit of production method based on the estimated gross proved reserves as determined by independent petroleum engineers 
for this purpose  we convert our petroleum products and reserves to a common unit of measure 
costs of acquiring and evaluating unproved properties are initially excluded from depletion calculations 
these unevaluated properties are assessed quarterly to ascertain whether impairment has occurred 
when proved reserves are assigned or the property is considered to be impaired  the cost of the property or the amount of the impairment is added to the full cost pool and becomes subject to depletion calculations 
proceeds from the sale of oil and natural gas properties are applied against capitalized costs  with no gain or loss recognized  unless the sale would alter the rate of depletion by more than 
royalties paid  net of any tax credits received  are netted against oil and natural gas sales 
in applying the full cost method  we perform a ceiling test on properties that restricts the capitalized costs  less accumulated depletion  from exceeding an amount equal to the estimated undiscounted value of future net revenues from proved oil and natural gas reserves  as determined by independent petroleum engineers 
the estimated future revenues are based on sales prices achievable under existing contracts and posted average reference prices in effect at the end of the applicable period  and current costs  and after deducting estimated future general and administrative expenses  production related expenses  financing costs  future site restoration costs and income taxes 
under the full cost method of accounting  capitalized oil and natural gas property costs  less accumulated depletion and net of deferred income taxes  may not exceed an amount equal to the present value  discounted at  of estimated future net revenues from proved oil and natural gas reserves  plus the cost  or estimated fair value if lower  of unproved properties 
should capitalized costs exceed this ceiling  we would recognize an impairment 

table of contents stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation under the provisions of asc topic this guidance requires us to record expense associated with the fair value of stock based compensation 
we currently use the black scholes option valuation model to calculate stock based compensation 
foreign currency fluctuations monetary items denominated in a foreign currency  other than us dollars  are converted into us dollars at exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date 
foreign currency denomination revenue and expense items are translated at exchange rates prevailing at the transaction date 
gains or losses arising from the translations are included in operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk our primary market risk is market changes in oil and natural gas prices 
the market prices for oil and natural gas have been highly volatile and are likely to continue to be highly volatile in the future  which will impact our prospective revenues from the sale of products or properties 
during  we began managing this commodity price risk exposure through the use of derivative financial instruments entered into with third party counterparties 
currently  we utilize swaps and no premium collars to reduce the effect of price changes on a portion of our future oil production 
we do not enter into derivative instruments for trading purposes 
we use costless collars to establish floor and ceiling prices on our anticipated future oil production 
we neither receive nor pay net premiums when we enter into these arrangements 
these contracts are settled monthly 
when the settlement price the market price for oil or natural gas on the settlement date for a period is above the ceiling price  we pay our counterparty 
when the settlement price for a period is below the floor price  our counterparty is required to pay us 
all hedges are accounted for using mark to market accounting 
we use swaps to fix the sales price for our anticipated future oil production 
upon settlement  we receive a fixed price for the hedged commodity and pay our counterparty a floating market price  as defined in each instrument 
these instruments are settled monthly 
when the floating price exceeds the fixed price for a contract month  we pay our counterparty 
when the fixed price exceeds the floating price  our counterparty is required to make a payment to us 
the use of derivatives involves the risk that the counterparties to such instruments will be unable to meet the financial terms of such contracts 
the company wholly owned subsidiary  kodiak oil gas usa inc  is currently a party to derivative contracts with one counterparty  and the company is a guarantor of kodiak oil gas usa inc the company has netting arrangements with the counterparty that provide for the offset of payables against receivables from separate derivative arrangements with the counterparty in the event of contract termination 
although the instruments are valued using indices published by established exchanges  the instruments are traded directly with the counterparties 
the derivative contracts may be terminated by a non defaulting party in the event of default by one of the parties to the agreement 
the objective of the company use of derivative financial instruments is to achieve more predictable cash flows in an environment of volatile oil and gas prices and to manage its exposure to commodity price risk 
while the use of these derivative instruments limits the downside risk of adverse price movements  these instruments may also limit the company ability to benefit from favorable price movements 
the company may  from time to time  add incremental derivatives to hedge additional production  restructure existing derivative contracts or enter into new transactions to modify the terms of current contracts in order to realize the current value of the company existing positions
