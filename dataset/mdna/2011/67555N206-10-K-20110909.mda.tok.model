results of operations on june  we announced the signing of a definitive agreement with newport  under which newport would acquire our new focus business in exchange for newport s high power laser diodes business 
the transaction closed on july  we have classified the financial results of the new focus business as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
the following presentations relate to continuing operations only  unless otherwise indicated 

table of contents fiscal years ended july  and july  the following table sets forth our consolidated results of operations for the fiscal years ended july  and july   and the year over year increase decrease in our results  expressed both in dollar amounts thousands and as a percentage of revenues  except where indicated year ended increase july  july  change decrease thousands thousands thousands revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative amortization of intangible assets restructuring  acquisition and related costs legal settlements   n m impairment of goodwill   n m gain loss on sale of property and equipment n m total operating expenses operating income loss    n m other income expense interest income interest expense gain loss on foreign currency translation    n m other income expense total other income expense    n m income loss from continuing operations before income taxes    n m income tax provision income loss from continuing operations    n m income from discontinued operations  net of tax net income loss    n m not meaningful revenues revenues for the year ended july  increased by million  or percent  compared to the year ended july  the increase was primarily from increased product sales attributable to improved market conditions as our sector experienced a rebound from the economic downturn  as compared to the market conditions of calendar year  and from our acquisitions of mintera in july and xtellus in december during the second half of fiscal year  short term decreases in demand  including a slowdown of gb s deployments in china  and reduced sales as a result of inventory adjustments with many of our customers offset the improved market conditions we have otherwise seen since fiscal year 
table of contents for the year ended july   huawei accounted for million  or percent  and alcatel lucent accounted for million  or percent  of our revenues 
for the year ended july   huawei accounted for million  or percent  of our revenues and alcatel lucent accounted for million  or percent  of our revenues 
cost of revenues our cost of revenues consists of the costs associated with manufacturing our products  and includes the purchase of raw materials  labor costs and related overhead  including stock based compensation charges and the costs charged by our contract manufacturers for the products they manufacture for us 
charges for excess and obsolete inventory are also included in cost of revenues 
costs and expenses related to our manufacturing resources incurred in connection with the development of new products are included in research and development expense 
our cost of revenues for the year ended july  increased by million  or percent  compared to the year ended july  the increase was primarily related to costs associated with our percent increase in revenues during fiscal year and from increased costs associated with revenues from our acquisitions of mintera and xtellus 
we also had a million increase in depreciation expense  offset in part by lower costs from having one less week of expenses in fiscal year compared to fiscal year our cost of revenues were also unfavorably impacted by approximately million as a result of the swiss franc strengthening relative to the us dollar and million as a result of the us pound sterling strengthening relative to the us dollar 
gross profit gross profit is calculated as revenues less cost of revenues 
gross margin rate is gross profit reflected as a percentage of revenues 
our gross margin rate decreased to percent for the year ended july   compared to percent for the year ended july  our gross profit was unfavorably impacted by approximately million as a result of the swiss franc strengthening relative to the us dollar and million as a result of the uk pound sterling strengthening relative to the us dollar 
in addition  we had a million increase in depreciation expense  offset in part by lower costs from having one less week of expenses in fiscal year compared to fiscal year research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs of employees engaged in research and design activities  including stock based compensation charges related to those employees  costs of design tools and computer hardware  costs related to prototyping and facilities costs for certain research and development focused sites 
research and development expenses increased by million  or percent  for the year ended july   compared to the year ended july  our research and development expenses increased as we invested to match the rate of our anticipated revenue growth for fiscal year this includes increased spending on personnel and on materials associated with our product development efforts 
the increase was also attributable to research and development associated with increased personnel and product development efforts related to our acquisitions of mintera in july and xtellus in december these increases were offset in part by having an additional week of expenses during the year ended july  compared to the year ended july  beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we began to decrease the rate of our investment in research and development in response to changing short term revenue growth expectations  and expect this trend to continue in our fiscal quarter ended october  we do expect research and development expenses to be higher in amount for the full fiscal year  as compared to the full fiscal year personnel related costs increased to million for the year ended july   compared with million for the year ended july  other costs  including engineering materials  the costs of design tools and facilities related costs increased to million for the year ended july   compared with million for the year ended july  research and development expenses were unfavorably impacted by approximately million as a result of the uk pound sterling strengthening relative to the us dollar and million as a result of the swiss franc strengthening relative to the us dollar 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenses  including stock based compensation charges related to employees engaged in sales  general and administrative functions  legal and professional fees  facilities expenses excluding manufacturing and research and development focused sites  insurance expenses and certain information technology costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or percent  for the year ended july   compared to the year ended july  the increase was primarily due to the increase in costs incurred in connection with recent acquisitions  offset in part by the additional week of expenses during the year ended july  personnel related costs increased to million for the year ended july   compared with million for the year ended july  other costs  including legal and professional fees  facilities expenses and other miscellaneous expenses  increased to million for the year ended july   compared with million for the year ended july  selling  general and administrative expenses were unfavorably impacted by approximately million as a result of the uk pound sterling strengthening relative to the uk dollar and million as a result of the swiss franc strengthening relative to the us dollar 
amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets increased to million for the year ended july  from million for the year ended july  this million increase was primarily attributable to our acquisitions of mintera in july and xtellus in december specifically  the amortizable base of our intangible assets increased by million from our mintera acquisition and by million from our xtellus acquisition 
we expect the amortization of intangible assets to increase from million to million for fiscal year  million for fiscal years through and million for fiscal year based on the current level of our intangible assets 
restructuring  acquisition and related costs we incurred million in employee separation costs during the year ended july  in connection with previously announced restructuring plans  offset by reductions to our restructuring reserve of million from revised estimates for employee separation costs  lease cancellation and commitments and other charges 
we do not expect to incur significant additional restructuring costs in connection with previously announced restructuring plans 
we also incurred million during the year ended july  in external consulting charges associated with our next phase of optimization of past acquisitions as we focus on the associated infrastructure and processes required to support sustainable growth 
in addition  we recorded million in acquisition related professional fees during this same period 
legal settlements legal settlements expense of million during the year ended july  includes amounts recorded in connection with a confidential settlement agreement with qinetiq limited and for other legal settlements and related legal costs 
impairment of goodwill during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we completed our annual first step analysis for potential impairment of our goodwill  which included examining the impact of current general economic conditions on our future prospects and the current level of our market capitalization 
based on this analysis  including the effect of recent declines in our stock price and market capitalization  we concluded that goodwill related to our wss reporting unit was impaired 
our wss reporting unit s goodwill was originally recorded in connection with our acquisition of xtellus 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we also completed our second step analysis of goodwill impairment  determining that the million of goodwill related to our wss reporting unit was fully impaired 
based upon this evaluation  we recorded million for the goodwill impairment loss in our consolidated statement of operations for fiscal year 
table of contents gain on sale of property and equipment for the year ended july   we recorded a net gain of million  primarily related to the sale of certain fixed assets in villebon  france in connection with the closing of that facility 
other income expense other income expense for the year ended july  decreased by million compared to the year ended july  this decrease was primarily due to an million increase in foreign exchange loss from the non cash re measurement of short term receivables and payables among certain of our wholly owned international subsidiaries for fluctuations in the us dollar relative to our other local functional currencies during the corresponding periods 
this decrease was also due to a million in gain from our purchase of newport s high power laser diodes business being recorded during the year ended july  and from a million increase in interest expense during the year ended july  related to liabilities recognized in the acquisitions of xtellus and mintera 
income tax provision for the fiscal year ended july   our income tax provision of million primarily related to certain of our foreign operations  which operate on a cost plus basis for services primarily associated with manufacturing and research and development 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we determined that it is more likely than not that we will utilize net operating losses in one of our foreign jurisdictions due to current earnings and projections of future profitability 
accordingly  we released million of our valuation allowance against million of previously unrecognized deferred tax assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal year this amount represented the entire remaining deferred tax asset related to the accumulated net operating losses of the foreign jurisdiction 
due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of the tax attributes in other jurisdictions  we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our remaining foreign and domestic deferred tax assets as of july  income from discontinued operations no amounts related to revenues  cost of revenues  gross profit or operating expenses were recognized during fiscal years and due to the sale of our new focus business on july  during fiscal year  we recorded income of million from discontinued operations from the sale of our new focus business

gross profit our gross margin rate increased to percent for the year ended july   compared to percent for the year ended june  the increase in gross margin rate was primarily due to operating leverage from higher revenue volumes  synergies from the merger with avanex  including related cost reductions and the internal sourcing of oclaro components into avanex products  as well as the impact of other cost reduction efforts during fiscal year and earlier

we expect that our cash flows from operations  together with our current cash balances and amounts expected to be available under our credit agreement  which are based on a percentage of eligible accounts receivable as defined in the credit agreement  will provide us with sufficient financial resources in order to operate as a going concern through at least fiscal year in the future  in order to strengthen our financial position  in the event of unforeseen circumstances  or in the event we need to fund our growth in future financial periods  we may need to raise additional funds by any one or a combination of the following i issuing equity securities  ii incurring indebtedness secured by our assets  iii issuing debt and or convertible debt securities  or iv selling product lines and or portions of our business 
there can be no guarantee that we will be able to raise additional funds on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
from time to time  we have engaged in discussions with third parties concerning potential acquisitions of product lines  technologies and businesses  such as our merger with avanex  our acquisitions of xtellus and mintera  and our exchange of assets agreement with newport 
we continue to consider potential acquisition candidates 
any such transactions could result in us issuing significant number of new equity or debt securities including promissory notes  the incurrence or assumption of debt  and the utilization of our cash and cash equivalents 
we may also be required to raise additional funds to complete any such acquisition  through either the issuance of equity securities and or borrowings 
if we raise additional funds or acquire businesses or technologies through the issuance of equity securities  our existing stockholders may experience significant dilution 
risk management foreign currency risk as our business is multinational in scope  we are increasingly subject to fluctuations based upon changes in the exchange rates between the currencies in which we collect revenues and pay expenses 
in the future  we expect that a majority of our revenues will be denominated in us dollars  while a significant portion of our expenses will continue to be denominated in uk pounds sterling and the swiss franc 
fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us dollar  the us pound sterling and the swiss franc and  to a lesser extent  other currencies in which we collect revenues and pay expenses could affect our operating results 
this includes the chinese yuan  the korean won  the israeli shekel and the euro in which we pay expenses in connection with operating our facilities in shenzhen and shanghai  china  daejeon  south korea  jerusalem  israel and san donato  italy 
to the extent the exchange rate between the us dollar and these currencies were to fluctuate more significantly than experienced to date  our exposure would increase 
we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts in an effort to mitigate a portion of our exposure to such fluctuations between the us dollar and the us pound sterling  and we may be required to convert currencies to meet our obligations 
under certain circumstances  foreign currency forward exchange contracts can have an adverse effect on our financial condition 
as of july   we held five foreign currency forward exchange contracts with a notional value of million which include put and call options which expire  or expired  at various dates from july to november as of july   we recorded an unrealized gain of million to accumulated other comprehensive income in connection with marking these contracts to fair value 

table of contents contractual obligations our contractual obligations at july   by nature of the obligation and amount due over identified periods of time  are set out in the table below operating sublease purchase long term leases income obligations obligations thousands fiscal year thereafter the purchase obligations consist of our total outstanding purchase order commitments at july  any capital purchases to which we are committed are included in these outstanding purchase order commitments 
operating leases are future annual commitments under non cancelable operating leases  including rents payable for land and buildings 
off balance sheet arrangements we indemnify our directors and certain employees as permitted by law  and have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and executive officers 
we have not recorded a liability associated with these indemnification arrangements as we historically have not incurred any material costs associated with such indemnification obligations 
costs associated with such indemnification obligations may be mitigated by insurance coverage that we maintain  however  such insurance may not cover any  or may cover only a portion of  the amounts we may be required to pay 
in addition  we may not be able to maintain such insurance coverage in the future 
we also have indemnification clauses in various contracts that we enter into in the normal course of business  such as indemnifications in favor of customers in respect of liabilities they may incur as a result of purchasing our products should such products infringe the intellectual property rights of a third party 
we have not historically paid out any material amounts related to these indemnifications  therefore  no accrual has been made for these indemnifications 
other than as set forth above  we are not currently party to any material off balance sheet arrangements 
recent accounting pronouncements see note  business and summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for information regarding the effect of new accounting pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or us gaap 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and other financial information 
actual results may differ significantly from those based on our estimates and judgments or could have been materially different if we had used different assumptions  estimates or conditions 
in addition  our financial condition and results of operations could vary due to a change in the application of a particular accounting standard 

table of contents we regard an accounting estimate or assumption underlying our financial statements as a critical accounting estimate where the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change  and the impact of such estimates and assumptions on our financial condition or operating performance is material 
our significant accounting policies are described in note  business and summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
not all of these significant accounting policies  however  require that we make estimates and assumptions that we believe are critical accounting estimates 
we have discussed our accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and we believe that the policies described below involve critical accounting estimates 
revenue recognition and sales returns revenue represents the amounts  excluding sales taxes  derived from the sale of goods and services to third party customers during a given period 
specifically  we recognize product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been shipped  title has transferred  collectability is reasonably assured  fees are fixed or determinable and there are no uncertainties with respect to customer acceptance 
for certain sales  we are required to determine  in particular  whether the delivery has occurred  whether items will be returned and whether we will be paid under normal commercial terms 
for certain products sold to customers  we specify delivery terms in the agreement under which the sale was made and assess each shipment against those terms  and only recognize revenue when we are certain that the delivery terms have been met 
we record a provision for estimated sales returns in the same period as the related revenues are recorded  which is netted against revenue 
these estimates for sales returns are based on historical sales return rates  other known factors and our return policy 
before accepting a new customer  we review publicly available information and credit rating databases to provide ourselves with reasonable assurance that the new customer will pay all outstanding amounts in accordance with our standard terms 
for existing customers  we monitor historic payment patterns and we perform ongoing credit evaluations to assess whether we can expect payment in accordance with the terms set forth in the agreement under which the sale was made 
we recognize revenues from financially distressed customers when collectability becomes reasonably assured  assuming all other above criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
in fiscal year we issued billings of million for products that were shipped to nortel  but for which payment was not received prior to nortel s bankruptcy filing on january  as a result  the corresponding revenue was deferred  and therefore was not recognized as revenues or accounts receivable in the consolidated financial statements at the time of such billings  as we determined that such amounts were not reasonably assured of collectability in accordance with our revenue recognition policy 
as of july   we had remaining contractual receivables from nortel totaling million which are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
to the extent that collectability becomes reasonably assured for these deferred billings in future periods  our future results of operations will benefit from the recognition of these amounts 
inventory valuation in general  our inventories are valued at the lower of cost to acquire or manufacture our products or market value  less write offs of inventory we believe could prove to be unsalable 
manufacturing costs include the cost of the components purchased to produce our products and related labor and overhead 
we review our inventory on a quarterly basis to determine if it is saleable 
products may be unsalable because they are technically obsolete due to substitute products  specification changes or excess inventory relative to customer forecasts 
we currently reduce the cost basis for inventory using methods that take these factors into account 
if we find that the cost of inventory is greater than the current market price  we will write the inventory down to the estimated selling price  less the estimated cost to complete and sell the product 
business combinations through june   we accounted for our acquisitions using the purchase accounting method in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 business combinations 
under this method  we allocated the purchase price of acquired companies to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  based on their estimated relative fair values at the acquisition date  with any excess allocated to goodwill defined as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
our judgments as to fair value of the assets  therefore  affected the amount of goodwill that we recorded 
these judgments included estimating the useful lives over which the fair values are or were amortized to expense 

table of contents for tangible assets acquired in any acquisition  such as plant and equipment  we estimate useful lives by considering comparable lives of similar assets  past history  the intended use of the assets and their condition 
in estimating the useful life of acquired intangible assets with definite lives  we consider the industry environment and specific factors relating to each product relative to our business strategy and the likelihood of technological obsolescence 
acquired intangible assets primarily include core and current technology  patents  supply agreements  capitalized licenses and customer contracts 
we amortize our acquired intangible assets with definite lives over periods generally ranging from to years and  in the case of one specific customer contract  years 
our acquisitions consummated after june   including the acquisition of the high power laser diodes business from newport on july  and our acquisitions of xtellus on december  and mintera on july   were accounted for pursuant to accounting standards codification asc topic  business combinations 
under asc topic  there are significant differences as compared to sfas no 
in determining the purchase price of an acquired entity  including under asc topic  the purchase price is equivalent to the fair value of consideration transferred on the date of the business combination 
previously  the value of equity based consideration transferred was determined based on the fair value at the time of announcement of the business combination 
tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date are recorded at the acquisition date fair value 
such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to the identifiable intangible assets 
goodwill is recognized for any excess of purchase price over the net fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
a bargain purchase gain results if the fair value of the purchase price is less than the net fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
we recorded a million bargain purchase gain related to our acquisition of newport s high power laser diodes business during fiscal year management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable and that of a market participant 
for instance  the estimated fair value of our common stock issued in connection with our acquisition of xtellus was determined using the closing price of per share as of the acquisition date  december   adjusted by a discount rate to reflect the lack of marketability due to the shares being unregistered and subject to restrictions on transfer under rule of the securities act 
in addition  the estimated fair value of the value protection guarantee issued in connection with the xtellus acquisition was determined by using management estimates of future operating results and a monte carlo simulation model to determine the likelihood of achieving certain market conditions 
for our mintera acquisition  we agreed to pay additional revenue based consideration whereby former security holders of mintera are entitled to receive up to million  determined based on a set of sliding scale formulas  to the extent revenue from mintera products is more than million in the months following the acquisition and or more than million in the months following the acquisition 
the estimated fair value of these obligations were determined using management estimates of the total amounts expected to be paid based on estimated operating results  discounted to their present value using our incremental borrowing cost 
our preliminary estimates of fair value are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement 
as a result  during the measurement period for a business combination  which may be up to one year  we may record adjustments to the values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
after the conclusion of the measurement period or our final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed  whichever comes first  subsequent adjustments affecting earnings are recorded within our consolidated statements of operations 
as a result of adopting the revised accounting standards provided for by asc topic as of the beginning of our fiscal year  certain of our policies differ when accounting for acquisitions consummated after june   including the direct transaction costs associated with a business combination are expensed as incurred previously  direct transaction costs were included as part of the purchase price  
table of contents the costs to exit or restructure certain activities of an acquired company are accounted for separately from the business combination previously  restructuring and exit costs directly resulting from the business combination were included as a part of the assumed obligations in deriving the purchase price allocation  and the fair value of in process research and development is recorded as an indefinite lived intangible asset until the underlying project is completed  at which time the intangible asset is amortized over its estimated useful life  or abandoned  at which time the intangible asset is expensed previously  in process research and development was expensed as of the acquisition date 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is tested annually for impairment  in our case during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  or more often if an event or circumstance suggests impairment has occurred 
in addition  we review identifiable intangibles  excluding goodwill  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
circumstances which could trigger an impairment test include  but are not limited to  significant decreases in the market price of the asset  significant adverse changes to the business climate or legal factors  current period cash flow or operating losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset and a current expectation that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed of significantly below carrying value before the end of its estimated useful life 
the first step of testing goodwill for impairment is based on a reporting unit s fair value  which is generally determined through market prices 
in certain cases  due to the absence of market prices for a particular element of our business  we have elected to base our testing on discounted future expected cash flows 
although the discount rates and other input variables may differ  the model we use in this process is the same model we use to evaluate the fair value of acquisition candidates and the fairness of offers to purchase businesses that we are considering for divestiture 
the forecasted cash flows we use are derived from the annual long range planning process that we perform and present to our board of directors 
in this process  each reporting unit is required to develop reasonable sales  earnings and cash flow forecasts for the next three to seven years based on current and forecasted economic conditions 
for purposes of testing for impairment  the cash flow forecasts are adjusted as needed to reflect information that becomes available concerning changes in business levels and general economic trends 
the discount rates used for determining discounted future cash flows are generally based on our weighted average cost of capital and are then adjusted for plan risk the risk that a business will fail to achieve its forecasted results and country risk the risk that economic or political instability in the countries in which we operate will cause a business unit s projections to be inaccurate 
finally  a growth factor beyond the three to seven year period for which cash flows are planned is selected based on expectations of future economic conditions 
virtually all of the assumptions used in our models are susceptible to change due to global and regional economic conditions as well as competitive factors in the industry in which we operate 
unanticipated changes in discount rates from one year to the next can also have a significant effect on the results of the calculations 
while we believe the estimates and assumptions we use are reasonable  various economic factors could cause the results of our goodwill testing to vary significantly 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we completed our annual first step analysis for potential impairment of our goodwill  which included examining the impact of current general economic conditions on our future prospects and the current level of our market capitalization 
based on this analysis  we concluded that goodwill related to our wss reporting unit was impaired 
our wss reporting unit s goodwill was originally recorded in connection with our acquisition of xtellus 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we also completed our second step analysis of goodwill impairment  determining that the million of goodwill related to our wss reporting unit was fully impaired 
based upon this evaluation  we recorded million for the goodwill impairment loss in our consolidated statement of operations for fiscal year in conjunction with our second step goodwill impairment analysis  we also evaluated the fair value of the intangible assets of this reporting unit and concluded that such assets were not impaired 
during the fiscal year ended june   we observed indicators of potential impairment of our goodwill  including the impact of the then current general economic downturn  our future prospects and the continued decline of our market capitalization  which caused us to conduct a goodwill impairment analysis 
specifically  indicators emerged within our new focus reporting unit  which includes the technology acquired in the march acquisition of oclaro photonics  inc and one other reporting unit that included the technology acquired in the march acquisition of avalon photonics ag the avalon reporting unit 
these indicators led us to conclude that an impairment test was required to be performed for goodwill related to these reporting units 

table of contents during the fiscal year ended june   we determined  in our first step goodwill impairment analysis  that the goodwill related to our new focus and avalon reporting units were in fact impaired 
we completed our full evaluation of the second step impairment analysis  which indicated that the goodwill was fully impaired 
we recorded million for impairment losses in our statement of operations for the year ended june  in conjunction with our full evaluation of the second step goodwill impairment analysis  we also evaluated the fair value of the intangible assets of these two reporting units 
based on this testing  we determined that the intangibles of our new focus reporting unit and our avalon reporting units were impaired 
we recorded million for the impairment loss related to these intangibles  net of million associated with the discontinued operations of the new focus business  in our statements of operations for the year ended june  these impairments will not result in any current or future cash expenditures 
accounting for stock based compensation we recognize in our statement of operations all stock based compensation  including grants of employee stock options and restricted stock  based on their fair values on the grant dates 
estimating the grant date fair value of employee stock options requires us to make judgments in the determination of inputs into the black scholes merton valuation model which we use to arrive at an estimate of the fair value for such awards 
these inputs are based upon highly subjective assumptions as to the volatility of the underlying stock  risk free interest rates and the expected life of the options 
judgment is also required in estimating the number of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited during any given period 
as required under the accounting rules  we review our valuation assumptions at each grant date  and  as a result  our valuation assumptions used to value employee stock options granted in future periods may change 
if actual results or future changes in estimates differ significantly from our current estimates  stock based compensation expense and our consolidated results of operations could be materially impacted 
during the years ended july   july  and june   we recognized million  million and million of stock based compensation expense  respectively  in our results from continuing operations 
see note  stock based compensation  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for further information 
income taxes we account for income taxes using an asset and liability based approach 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates 
valuation allowances are provided against deferred income tax assets which are not likely to be realized 
in fiscal year  we determined that it is more likely than not that we will utilize net operating losses in one of our foreign jurisdictions due to current earnings and projections of future profitability 
accordingly  we released million of our valuation allowance against million of previously unrecognized deferred tax assets during fiscal year this amount represented the entire remaining deferred tax asset related to the accumulated net operating losses of the foreign jurisdiction 
due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of the tax attributes in other jurisdictions  we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our remaining foreign and domestic deferred tax assets as of july  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates we finance our operations through a mixture of issuances of equity securities  finance leases  working capital and by drawing on our credit agreement 
our only exposure to interest rate fluctuations is on our cash deposits and for amounts borrowed under our credit agreement 
at july  there was no amount outstanding under our credit agreement 
as of july   we had million in three outstanding standby letters of credit with vendors secured under our credit agreement 
we monitor our interest rate risk on cash balances primarily through cash flow forecasting 
cash that is surplus to immediate requirements is invested in short term deposits with banks accessible with one day s notice and invested in overnight money market accounts 
we believe our current interest rate risk is immaterial 

table of contents foreign currency as our business has grown and become multinational in scope  we have become increasingly subject to fluctuations based upon changes in the exchange rates between the currencies in which we collect revenues and pay expenses 
despite our change in domicile from the united kingdom to the united states in  and our movement of certain functions  including assembly and test operations  from the united kingdom to china  in the future we expect that a majority of our revenues will continue to be denominated in us dollars  while a significant portion of our expenses will continue to be denominated in uk pounds sterling and the swiss franc 
fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us dollar  the uk pound sterling and the swiss franc and  to a lesser extent  other currencies in which we collect revenues and pay expenses  could affect our operating results 
this includes the chinese yuan  the korean won  the israeli shekel and the euro in which we pay expenses in connection with operating our facilities in shenzhen and shanghai  china  daejeon  south korea  jerusalem  israel and san donato  italy 
to the extent the exchange rate between the us dollar and these currencies were to fluctuate more significantly than experienced to date  our exposure would increase 
as of july   our uk subsidiary had million  net  in uk dollar denominated operating intercompany payables and million in us dollar denominated accounts receivable related to sales to external customers 
it is estimated that a percent fluctuation in the us dollar relative to the us pound sterling would lead to a profit of million us dollar strengthening  or loss of million us dollar weakening on the translation of these receivables  which would be recorded as gain loss on foreign exchange in our consolidated statement of operations 
hedging program we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts in an effort to mitigate a portion of our exposure to such fluctuations between the us dollar and the us pound sterling 
we do not currently hedge our exposure to the chinese yuan  korean won  israeli shekel  swiss franc or the euro  but we may in the future if conditions warrant 
we also do not currently hedge our exposure related to our us dollar denominated intercompany payables and receivables 
we may be required to convert currencies to meet our obligations 
under certain circumstances  foreign currency forward exchange contracts can have an adverse effect on our financial condition 
as of july   we held five foreign currency forward exchange contracts with a notional value of million which include put and call options which expire  or expired  at various dates from july to november and we have recorded an unrealized gain of million to accumulated other comprehensive income in connection with marking these contracts to fair value 
it is estimated that a percent fluctuation in the dollar between july  and the maturity dates of the put and call instruments underlying these contracts would lead to a profit of million us dollar weakening or break even us dollar strengthening on our outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts  should they be held to maturity
