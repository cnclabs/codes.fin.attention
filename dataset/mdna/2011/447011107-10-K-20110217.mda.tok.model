polyurethane chemicals are used to produce rigid and flexible foams  as well as coatings  adhesives  sealants and elastomers 
we focus on the higher margin  higher growth markets for mdi and mdi based polyurethane systems 
growth in our polyurethanes segment has been driven primarily by the continued substitution of mdi based products for other materials across a broad range of applications 
we operate five primary polyurethanes manufacturing facilities in the us  europe and china 
we also operate polyurethanes formulation facilities  which are located in close proximity to our customers worldwide 
our customers produce polyurethane products through the combination of an isocyanate  such as mdi or tdi  with polyols  which are derived largely from po and eo 
while the range of tdi based products is relatively limited  we are able to produce over  distinct mdi based polyurethane products by modifying the mdi molecule through varying the proportion and type of polyol used and by introducing other chemical additives to our mdi formulations 
as a result  polyurethane products  especially those derived from mdi  are continuing to replace traditional products in a wide range of end use markets  including insulation in construction and appliances  cushioning for automotive and furniture  adhesives  wood binders  footwear and other specialized engineering applications 
we are a leading north american producer of po 
we and some of our customers process po into derivative products  such as polyols for polyurethane products  pg and various other chemical products 
end uses for these derivative products include applications in the home furnishings  construction  appliance  packaging  automotive and transportation  food  paints and coatings and

item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a discussion of material changes concerning sales of mtbe 
in  we were the first global supplier of polyurethane chemicals to open a technical service center in china 
we have since expanded this facility to include an integrated polyurethanes formulation facility 
in january  we entered into two related joint ventures to build mdi production and finishing facilities near shanghai  china 
production at our mdi finishing plant near shanghai  china operated by hps  a consolidated joint venture  was commissioned on june  production at the mnb  aniline and crude mdi plants operated by slic  an unconsolidated joint venture  commenced on september  these world scale facilities strengthen our ability to service our customers in the critical chinese market and will support the significant demand growth that we believe this region will continue to experience 
products and markets mdi is used primarily in rigid foam applications and in a wide variety of customized  higher value flexible foam and coatings  adhesives  sealants and elastomers 
polyols  including polyether and polyester polyols  are used in conjunction with mdi and tdi in rigid foam  flexible foam and other non foam applications 
po is one of the principal raw materials for producing polyether polyols 
the following chart illustrates the range of product types and end uses for polyurethane chemicals 
graphic polyurethane chemicals are sold to customers who combine the chemicals to produce polyurethane products 
depending on their needs  customers will use either commodity polyurethane chemicals produced for mass sales or polyurethane systems tailored for their specific requirements 
by varying the blend  additives and specifications of the polyurethane chemicals  manufacturers are able to develop and produce a breadth and variety of polyurethane products 

table of contents mdi 
mdi has a substantially larger market size and a higher growth rate than tdi 
this is primarily because mdi can be used to make polyurethanes with a broader range of properties and can therefore be used in a wider range of applications than tdi 
we believe that future growth of mdi is expected to be driven by the continued substitution of mdi based polyurethane for fiberglass and other materials currently used in rigid insulation foam for construction 
we expect that other markets  such as binders for reconstituted wood board products  specialty cushioning applications and coatings will further contribute to the continued growth of mdi 
with the recent rapid growth of the developing asian economies  the asian markets have now become the largest market for mdi 
in addition to the company  there are three other major global producers of mdi bayer  basf and dow 
while there are also some regional producers in asia and europe  we believe it is unlikely that any new global producers of mdi will emerge in the foreseeable future due to the substantial requirements for entry  such as the limited availability of licenses for mdi technology and the significant capital commitment and integration that is required to develop both the necessary technology and the infrastructure to manufacture and market mdi 
tpu 
tpu is a high quality  fully formulated thermal plastic derived from the reaction of mdi or an aliphatic isocyanate with polyols to produce unique qualities such as durability  flexibility  strength  abrasion resistance  shock absorbency and chemical resistance 
we can tailor the performance characteristics of tpu to meet the specific requirements of our customers 
tpu is used in injection molding and small components for the automotive and footwear industries 
it is also extruded into films  wires and cables for use in a wide variety of applications in the coatings  adhesives  sealants and elastomers markets 
polyols 
polyols are combined with mdi  tdi and other isocyanates to create a broad spectrum of polyurethane products 
demand for specialty polyols has been growing at approximately the same rate at which mdi consumption has grown 
aniline 
aniline is an intermediate chemical used primarily to manufacture mdi 
generally  aniline is either consumed internally by the producers of the aniline or is sold to third parties under long term supply contracts 
we believe that the lack of a significant spot market for aniline means that in order to remain competitive  mdi manufacturers must either be integrated with an aniline manufacturing facility or have a long term  cost competitive aniline supply contract 

table of contents po 
po is an intermediate chemical used mainly to produce a wide range of polyols and pg 
demand for po depends largely on overall economic demand  especially that of consumer durables 
the following chart illustrates the primary end markets and applications for po 
graphic mtbe 
mtbe is an oxygenate that is blended with gasoline to reduce harmful vehicle emissions and to enhance the octane rating of gasoline 
the use of mtbe can be controversial  and it has been effectively eliminated in the us market

item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
sales and marketing we manage a global work force which sells our polyurethane chemicals to over  customers in more than countries 
our sales and technical resources are organized to support major regional markets  as well as key end use markets which require a more global approach 
these key end use markets include the appliance  automotive  footwear  furniture and coatings  construction products  adhesives  sealants and elastomers industries 
we provide a wide variety of polyurethane solutions as components ie  the isocyanate or the polyol or in the form of systems in which we provide the total isocyanate and polyol formulation to our customers in ready to use form 
our ability to deliver a range of polyurethane solutions and technical support tailored to meet our customer needs is critical to our long term success 
we have strategically located our polyurethane formulation facilities  commonly referred to in the chemicals industry as systems houses  close to our customers  enabling us to focus on customer support and technical service 
we believe this customer support and technical service system contributes to customer retention and also provides opportunities for identifying further product and service needs of customers 
we manufacture polyols primarily to support our mdi customers requirements 
we believe that the extensive market knowledge and industry experience of our sales teams and technical experts  in combination with our strong emphasis on customer relationships  have facilitated 
table of contents our ability to establish and maintain long term customer supply positions 
due to the specialized nature of our markets  our sales force must possess technical knowledge of our products and their applications 
our strategy is to continue to increase sales to existing customers and to attract new customers by providing innovative solutions  quality products  reliable supply  competitive prices and superior customer service 
manufacturing and operations our mdi production facilities are located in geismar  louisiana  rozenburg  netherlands  and through our joint ventures in caojing  china 
these facilities receive aniline  which is a primary material used in the production of mdi  from our facilities located in geismar  louisiana  wilton  uk  and caojing  china 
we believe that this relative scale and product integration of our large facilities provide a significant competitive advantage over other producers 
in addition to reducing transportation costs for our raw materials  integration helps reduce our exposure to cyclical prices 
the following table sets forth the annual production capacity of polyurethane chemicals at each of our polyurethanes facilities mdi polyols tpu aniline nitrobenzene po pg mtbe millions of pounds millions of gallons geismar  louisiana osnabr ck  germany port neches  texas ringwood  illinois caojing  china rozenburg  netherlands wilton  uk total represents our share of capacity from slic  an unconsolidated chinese joint venture 
represents our approximately share of capacity under our consolidated rubicon llc manufacturing joint venture with chemtura corporation 
at both our geismar and rozenburg facilities we utilize sophisticated proprietary technology to produce our mdi 
this technology  which is also used in our chinese joint venture  contributes to our position as a low cost mdi producer 
in addition to mdi  we use a proprietary manufacturing process to manufacture po 
we own or license all technology and know how developed and utilized at our po facility 
our process combines isobutane and oxygen in proprietary oxidation peroxidation reactors  thereby forming tbhp and tba  which are further processed into po and mtbe  respectively 
because our po production process is less expensive relative to other technologies and allows all of our po co products to be processed into saleable or useable materials  we believe that our po production technology possesses several distinct advantages over its alternatives

we are entitled to approximately of the nitrobenzene and aniline production capacity of rubicon llc  and chemtura corporation is entitled to of the dpa production 
in addition to operating the joint venture aniline  nitrobenzene and dpa facilities  rubicon llc also operates our wholly owned mdi and polyol facilities at geismar and is responsible for providing other auxiliary services to the entire geismar complex 
as a result of this joint venture  we are able to achieve greater scale and lower costs for our products than we would otherwise have been able to obtain 
rubicon llc is consolidated in our financial statements 
chinese mdi joint ventures 
in january  we entered into two related joint venture agreements to build mdi production facilities near shanghai  china 
slic  our manufacturing joint venture with basf ag and three chinese chemical companies  built three plants that manufacture mnb  aniline and crude mdi 
we effectively own of slic and account for our investment under the equity method 
hps  our splitting joint venture with shanghai chlor alkali chemical company  ltd  has constructed a plant to manufacture pure mdi  polymeric mdi and mdi variants 
we own of hps and it is a consolidated affiliate 
these projects have been funded by a combination of equity invested by the joint venture partners and borrowed funds 
slic and hps commenced operations during the total production capacity of the slic facilities is million pounds per year of mdi and the production capacity of the hps facility is million pounds per year of mdi finished products 
russian mdi  coatings and systems joint venture 
in  we purchased a interest in international polyurethane investments bv this company wholly owned subsidiary  nmg is a leading polyurethanes producer headquartered in obninsk  russia 
we account for this investment under the equity method 
this joint venture  now huntsman nmg zao  manufactures and markets a range of polyurethane systems in adhesives  coatings  elastomers and insulation using our mdi products 
raw materials the primary raw materials for mdi based polyurethane chemicals are benzene and po 
benzene is a widely available commodity that is the primary feedstock for the production of mdi and aniline 
historically  benzene has been the largest component of our raw material costs 
we purchase benzene from third parties to manufacture nitrobenzene and aniline  almost all of which we then use to produce mdi 
a major cost in the production of polyols is attributable to the costs of po 
the integration of our po business with our polyurethane chemicals business gives us access to a competitively priced  strategic source of po and the opportunity to develop polyols that enhance our range of mdi products 
the primary raw materials used in our po production process are butane isobutane  propylene  methanol and oxygen  which accounted for   and  respectively  of total raw material costs in we purchase our raw materials primarily under long term contracts 
while most of these feedstocks are commodity materials generally available to us from a wide variety of suppliers at competitive prices in the spot market  all the propylene used in the production of our po is produced internally and delivered through a pipeline connected to our po facility 
competition our major competitors in the polyurethane chemicals market include basf  bayer  dow  yantai wanhua and lyondellbasell 
while these competitors and others produce various types and quantities of polyurethane chemicals  we focus on mdi and mdi based polyurethane systems 
our polyurethane 
table of contents chemicals business competes in two basic ways where price is the dominant element of competition  our polyurethane chemicals business differentiates itself by its high level of customer support  including cooperation on technical and safety matters  and elsewhere  we compete on the basis of product performance and our ability to react quickly to changing customer needs and by providing customers with innovative solutions to their needs 
some of our competitors in the polyurethanes segment are among the world largest chemical companies and major integrated petroleum companies 
these competitors may have their own raw material resources 
some of these companies may be able to produce products more economically than we can 
in addition  some of our competitors in this market have greater financial resources  which may enable them to invest significant capital into their businesses  including expenditures for research and development 
if any of our current or future competitors in this market develop proprietary technology that enables them to produce products at a significantly lower cost  our technology could be rendered uneconomical or obsolete 
performance products general our performance products segment is organized around three market areas performance specialties  performance intermediates and maleic anhydride and licensing  and serves a wide variety of consumer and industrial end markets 
in performance specialties  we are a leading global producer of amines  carbonates and certain specialty surfactants 
growth in demand in our performance specialties market tends to be driven by the end performance characteristics that our products deliver to our customers

amines 
amines broadly refers to the family of intermediate chemicals that are produced by reacting ammonia with various ethylene and propylene derivatives 
generally  amines are valued for their properties as a reactive  emulsifying  dispersant  detergent  solvent or corrosion inhibiting agent 
growth in demand for amines is highly correlated with gdp growth due to its strong links to general industrial and consumer products markets 
however  certain segments of the amines market  such as polyetheramines  have grown at rates well in excess of gdp growth due to new product development  technical innovation  and substitution and replacement of competing products 
for example  polyetheramines are used by customers who demand increasingly sophisticated performance characteristics as an additive in the manufacture of highly customized epoxy formulations  enabling customers to penetrate new markets and substitute for traditional curing materials 
as amines are generally sold based upon the performance characteristics that they provide to customer specific end use application  pricing does not generally fluctuate directly with movements in underlying raw materials 
morpholine dga agent 
morpholine and dga agent are produced as co products by reacting ammonia with deg 
morpholine is used in a number of niche industrial applications including rubber curing as an accelerator and flocculants for water treatment 
dga agent is primarily used in gas treating  electronics  herbicides and metalworking end use applications 
carbonates 
ethylene and propylene carbonates are manufactured by reacting eo and po with carbon dioxide 
carbonates are used as solvents and as reactive diluents in polymer and coating applications 
they are also increasingly being used as a photo resist solvent in the manufacture of printed circuit boards  solar panels  lcd screens and the production of lithium batteries 
also  propylene carbonates have recently received approval by the us environmental protection agency the epa for use as a solvent in certain agricultural applications 
we expect these solvents to replace traditional aromatic solvents that are increasingly subject to legislative restrictions and prohibitions 

table of contents performance intermediates 
the following table sets forth the end markets for our performance intermediates products product group end markets surfactants alkoxylates household detergents  industrial cleaners  anti fog chemicals for glass  asphalt emulsions  shampoos  polymerization additives  de emulsifiers for petroleum production sulfonates sulfates powdered detergents  liquid detergents  shampoos  body washes  dishwashing liquids  industrial cleaners  emulsion polymerization  concrete superplasticizers  gypsum wallboard esters and derivatives shampoo  body wash  textile and leather treatment nitrogen derivatives bleach thickeners  baby shampoo  fabric conditioners  other personal care products formulated blends household detergents  textile and leather treatment  personal care products  pharmaceutical intermediates eo po block co polymers automatic dishwasher detergents ethanolamines wood preservatives  herbicides  construction  gas treatment  metalworking lab consumer detergents  industrial and institutional detergents  synthetic lubricants eg polyester fibers and pet bottle resins  antifreeze surfactants 
surfactants or surface active agents are substances that combine a water soluble component with a water insoluble component in the same molecule 
while surfactants are most commonly used for their detergency in cleaning applications  they are also valued for their emulsification  foaming  dispersing  penetrating and wetting properties in a variety of industries 
demand growth for surfactants is relatively stable and exhibits little cyclicality 
the main consumer product applications for surfactants can demand new formulations with improved performance characteristics  which affords considerable opportunity for innovative surfactants manufacturers like us to provide surfactants and blends with differentiated specifications and properties 
for basic surfactants  pricing tends to have a strong relationship to underlying raw material prices and usually lags raw material price movements 
ethanolamines 
ethanolamines are a range of chemicals produced by the reaction of eo with ammonia 
they are used as intermediates in the production of a variety of industrial  agricultural and consumer products 
there are a limited number of competitors due to the technical and cost barriers to entry 
growth in this sector has typically been higher than gdp but saw a decline in late followed by a recovery in demand in we believe the ethanolamines market in north america is currently balanced 
lab 
lab is a surfactant intermediate which is produced through the reaction of benzene with either normal paraffins or linear alpha olefins 
nearly all the lab produced globally is converted into las  a major anionic surfactant used worldwide for the production of consumer  industrial and institutional laundry detergents 

table of contents three major manufacturers lead the traditional detergency market for lab in north america procter gamble  henkel and the sun products corp 
we believe that two thirds of the lab global capacity lies in the hands of ten producers  with three or four major players in each of the three regional markets 
although the north american market for lab is mature  we expect latin american and other developing countries to grow as detergent demand grows at a faster rate than gdp 
however  growth in demand for specialty alkylates for use in lubricants is expected to be higher than gdp 
we have developed a unique manufacturing capability for a high molecular weight alkylate for this market 
with a significant technical barrier to entry  our specialty alkylate capability has allowed us greater diversity in our portfolio and strengthened our competitive position versus lab only producers 
eg 
we consume our internally produced eo to produce three types of eg meg  deg and teg 
meg is consumed primarily in the polyester fiber and bottle resin and antifreeze end markets and is also used in a wide variety of industrial applications including synthetic lubricants  plasticizers  solvents and emulsifiers 
deg is consumed internally for the production of morpholine dga agent and polyols 
teg is used internally for the production of polyols and is sold into the market for dehydration of natural gas 
we continue to optimize our eo and eg operations depending on the fundamental market demand for eg 
maleic anhydride and licensing 
the following table sets forth the end markets for our maleic anhydride products product group end markets maleic anhydride boat hulls  automotive  construction  lubricant and fuel additives  countertops  agrochemicals  paper  and food additives maleic anhydride catalyst and technology licensing maleic anhydride  bdo and its derivatives  and pbt manufacturers maleic anhydride is a chemical intermediate that is produced by oxidizing either benzene or normal butane through the use of a catalyst 
the largest use of maleic anhydride in the us is in the production of uprs  which we believe account for approximately of north american maleic anhydride demand 
upr is the main ingredient in fiberglass reinforced resins  which are used for marine and automotive applications and commercial and residential construction products 
our maleic anhydride technology is a proprietary fixed bed process with solvent recovery and is characterized by low butane consumption and an energy efficient  high percentage recovery solvent recovery system 
this process competes against two other processes  the fluid bed process and the fixed bed process with water recovery 
we believe that our process is superior in the areas of feedstock and energy efficiency and solvent recovery 
the maleic anhydride based route to bdo manufacture is currently the preferred process technology and is favored over the other routes  which include po  butadiene and acetylene as feedstocks 
as a result  the growth in demand for bdo has resulted in increased demand for our maleic anhydride technology and catalyst 
total north american demand for maleic anhydride in was approximately million pounds 
over time  demand for maleic anhydride has generally grown at rates that slightly exceed gdp growth 
however  given its dependence on the upr market  which is heavily influenced by construction end markets  demand for this application can be cyclical 
generally  changes in price have resulted from changes in industry capacity utilization as opposed to changes in underlying raw material costs 
on april   we announced that sasol huntsman  our maleic anhydride joint venture located in moers  germany  would be expanding its manufacturing capacity by approximately million pounds per year 
the new capacity will come online in the first quarter of the joint 
table of contents venture received secured nonrecourse financing that together with its cash flows from operations was used to fund the expansion 
sales and marketing we sell over  products to over  customers globally through our performance products marketing groups  which have extensive market knowledge  considerable chemical industry experience and well established customer relationships 
our performance specialties markets are organized around end use market applications  such as coatings  polymers and resins and agrochemical 
in these end uses  our marketing efforts are focused on how our product offerings perform in certain customer applications 
we believe that this approach enhances the value of our product offerings and creates opportunities for ongoing differentiation in our development activities with our customers 
our performance intermediates and maleic anhydride groups organize their marketing efforts around their products and geographic regions served 
we also provide extensive pre and post sales technical service support to our customers where our technical service professionals work closely with our research and development functions to tailor our product offerings to meet our customers unique and changing requirements 
finally  these technical service professionals interact closely with our market managers and business leadership teams to help guide future offerings and market approach strategies 
in addition to our focused direct sales efforts  we maintain an extensive global network of distributors and agents that also sell our products 
these distributors and agents typically promote our products to smaller end use customers who cannot be served cost effectively by our direct sales forces 
manufacturing and operations our performance products segment has the capacity to produce more than seven billion pounds annually of a wide variety of specialty  intermediate and commodity products and formulations at manufacturing locations in north america  europe  asia and australia 
these production capacities are as follows current capacity product area north america eame apac total millions of pounds performance specialties amines carbonates specialty surfactants performance intermediates eg eo ethanolamines ethylene lab propylene surfactants maleic anhydride includes up to million pounds of ethyleneamines that are made available from dow terneuzen  netherlands facility by way of a long term supply arrangement and million pounds

on april   we announced that sasol huntsman would be expanding its manufacturing capacity by approximately million pounds per year 
the new capacity will come online in the first quarter of and is not included in the production capacity table noted above 
our surfactants and amines facilities are located globally  with broad capabilities in amination  sulfonation and ethoxylation 
these facilities have a competitive cost base and use modern manufacturing units that allow for flexibility in production capabilities and technical innovation 
through the major restructuring of our surfactant operations  we have significantly improved the competitiveness of our surfactants business 
our primary ethylene  propylene  eo  eg and ethanolamines facilities are located in port neches  texas alongside our polyurethanes po mtbe facility 
the port neches  texas facility benefits from extensive logistics infrastructure  which allows for efficient sourcing of other raw materials and distribution of finished products 
our lab facility in chocolate bayou  texas and our maleic anhydride facility in pensacola  florida are both located within large  integrated petrochemical manufacturing complexes operated by ascend 
we believe this results in greater scale and lower costs for our products than we would be able to obtain if these facilities were stand alone operations 
in  we formed arabian amines company  a joint venture with the zamil group  which has constructed an ethyleneamines manufacturing plant in jubail  saudi arabia 
trial production commenced in the second quarter of  and  beginning july  arabian amines company generated significant revenues from the sale of product 
the plant has an approximate annual capacity of million pounds 
we will purchase and sell all of the production from this joint venture 
arabian amines company was accounted for under the equity method during its development stage 
we began consolidating this joint venture beginning july  raw materials we have the capacity to use approximately million pounds of ethylene each year produced in part at our port neches  texas facility in the production of eo and ethyleneamines 
we consume all of our eo in the manufacture of our eg  surfactants and amines products 
we also use internally produced po and deg in the manufacture of these products 
we have the capacity to produce million pounds of ethylene and million pounds of propylene  depending on feedstocks  at our port neches  texas facility 
all of the ethylene is used in the production of eo and substantially all of the propylene is consumed by the po unit at port neches operated by our polyurethanes business 
we purchase or toll the remainder of our ethylene and propylene requirements from third parties 
in addition to internally produced raw materials  our performance specialties market purchases over compounds in varying quantities  the largest of which includes ethylene dichloride  caustic soda  synthetic alcohols  paraffin  nonyl phenol  ammonia  hydrogen  methylamines and acrylonitrile 
the majority of these raw materials are available from multiple sources in the merchant market at competitive prices

pigments general we are a leading global manufacturer and marketer of titanium dioxide  which is a white pigment used to impart whiteness  brightness and opacity to products such as paints  plastics  paper  printing inks  fibers and ceramics 
we operate seven titanium dioxide manufacturing facilities located in north america  europe  asia and africa 
the global titanium dioxide market is characterized by a small number of large  global producers and a growing compliment of smaller regional producers 
we offer an extensive range of products  under the tioxide and deltio brand names  to approximately  customers in all major titanium dioxide end markets and geographic regions 
the geographic diversity of our manufacturing facilities allows our pigments segment to service local customers  as well as global customers that require delivery to more than one location 
our diverse customer base includes ampacet  a 
schulman  akzo nobel  basf  cabot  clariant  jotun  polyone and ppg 
our pigments business has an aggregate annual nameplate capacity of approximately  tonnes at our seven production facilities 
four of our titanium dioxide manufacturing plants are located in europe  one is in north america  one is in asia  and one is in south africa 
our north american operation consists of a interest in a manufacturing joint venture with kronos worldwide  inc our pigments segment is focused on improving our competitive position and providing customers with innovative products and solutions 
in  to further our competitive position we expanded the capacity of our greatham  uk chloride based facility by to  tonnes per year 
during the first quarter of  we closed our grimsby  uk sulphate based facility 
we recently announced an agreement in principle to an investment of approximately million approximately million to build a new magnesium sulfate fertilizer manufacturing operation at our plant in calais  france 
the new facility will enable the closure of part of our calais effluent treatment plant  which is expected to increase the efficiency  sustainability and cost effectiveness of the entire calais site 
we continue to pursue other projects to improve manufacturing costs at each of our facilities 
we are also introducing a number of innovative new products to the market  including our deltio range of free flowing pigments 
products and markets historically  global titanium dioxide demand growth rates tend to closely track global gdp growth rates 
however  the demand growth rate and its relationship with the gdp growth rate varies by region 
developed markets such as the us and western europe exhibit higher absolute consumption but lower demand growth rates  while emerging markets such as asia exhibit much higher demand growth rates 
the titanium dioxide industry experiences some seasonality in its sales reflecting the high exposure to seasonal coatings end use markets 
coating sales generally peak during the spring and summer months in the northern hemisphere  resulting in greater sales volumes during the second and third quarters of the year 
there are two manufacturing processes for the production of titanium dioxide  the sulfate process and the chloride process 
most recent capacity additions by the five major producers have employed the chloride process technology while those by smaller producers have generally used the sulphate process technology 
we currently believe that the chloride process accounts for approximately of global production capacity 
however  the global distribution of sulfate and chloride based titanium dioxide capacity varies by region  with the sulfate process being predominant in europe  our primary market 

table of contents the chloride process is the predominant process used in north america  and both processes are used in asia 
while most end use applications can use pigments produced by either process  regional market preferences typically favor products that are locally available 
we believe the chloride and sulfate manufacturing processes compete effectively in the marketplace 
aside from the five major producers  the titanium dioxide industry currently has a large number of small regional or local producers  especially in china 
titanium dioxide supply has historically kept pace with increases in demand as producers increased capacity through low cost incremental debottlenecks  efficiency improvements and  more recently  new capacity additions in china 
during periods of low titanium dioxide demand  the industry experiences high stock levels and consequently reduces production to manage working capital 
pricing in the industry is driven primarily by supply demand balance 
based upon current price levels and the long lead times for planning  governmental approvals and construction  we expect supply to continue for the near term in line with historical demand growth 
sales and marketing approximately of our titanium dioxide sales are made through our direct sales and technical services network  enabling us to cooperate more closely with our customers and to respond to our increasingly global customer base 
our concentrated sales effort and local manufacturing presence have allowed us to achieve our leading market shares in a number of the countries where we manufacture titanium dioxide 
in addition  we have focused on marketing products to higher growth industries 
for example  we believe that our pigments business is well positioned to benefit from the projected growth in the plastics sector which we expect to grow faster than the overall titanium dioxide market over the next several years 
manufacturing and operations our pigments business has eight manufacturing sites in seven countries with a total capacity of approximately  tonnes per year 
approximately of our titanium dioxide capacity is located in western europe 
the following table presents information regarding our titanium dioxide facilities region site annual capacity tonnes process western europe greatham  uk  chloride calais  france  sulfate huelva  spain  sulfate scarlino  italy  sulfate north america lake charles  louisiana chloride asia teluk kalung  malaysia sulfate southern africa umbogintwini  south africa sulfate total this facility is owned and operated by louisiana pigment company  lp  a manufacturing joint venture that is owned by us and by kronos worldwide 
the capacity shown reflects our interest in louisiana pigment company  lp in  we completed the expansion of our greatham  uk facility by  tonnes 
we are also well positioned to selectively invest in new plant capacity based upon our icon chloride technology 
icon technology allows for the construction of new capacity with world scale economics at a minimum 
table of contents nameplate size of  tonnes 
we believe competing chloride technologies typically require a minimum capacity of  tonnes to achieve comparable economics 
our chloride additions can be more easily absorbed into the market  which provides higher investment returns than larger capacity additions 
joint venture louisiana pigment company  lp is our joint venture with kronos worldwide 
we share production offtake and operating costs of the plant equally with kronos worldwide  though we market our share of the production independently 
the operations of the joint venture are under the direction of a supervisory committee on which each partner has equal representation 
our investment in louisiana pigment company  lp is accounted for using the equity method 
raw materials the primary raw materials used to produce titanium dioxide are titanium bearing ores 
we purchase the majority of our ore under long term supply contracts with a number of ore suppliers 
the majority of titanium bearing ores are sourced from australia  south africa and canada 
ore accounts for approximately of pigment variable manufacturing costs  while utilities electricity  gas and steam  sulfuric acid and chlorine collectively account for approximately of our variable manufacturing costs 
the world market for titanium bearing ores is characterized by a small number of large suppliers rio tinto  iluka and exxaro which account for approximately of global supply and from which we purchase approximately of our needs 
however  the choice of producers has increased in recent years with a number of emerging suppliers based in india and africa and we have broadened our supply base by purchasing increasing amounts of our ores from these suppliers 
the majority of our ore purchases are made under agreements with terms of three or more years 
titanium dioxide producers extract titanium from ores and process it into pigmentary titanium dioxide using either the chloride or sulfate process 
once an intermediate titanium dioxide pigment has been produced  it is finished into a product with specific performance characteristics for particular end use applications 
the finishing process is common to both the sulfate and chloride processes and is a major determinant of the final product performance characteristics 
the sulfate process generally uses less refined ores that are cheaper to purchase but produce more co product than the chloride process 
co products from both processes require treatment prior to disposal in order to comply with environmental regulations 
in order to reduce our disposal costs and to increase our cost competitiveness  we have developed and marketed the co products of our pigments business 
we sell over of the co products generated by our business 
competition the global markets in which our pigments business operates are highly competitive 
competition is based primarily on price 
in addition  we also compete on the basis of product quality and service 
the major global producers against whom we compete are dupont  tronox  kronos and cristal  each of which has a global presence and the ability to service all global markets 
some of our competitors may be able to produce products more economically than we can 
in addition  some of our competitors in this market have greater financial resources  which may enable them to invest significant capital into their businesses  including expenditures for research and development 
if any of our current or future competitors in this market develops proprietary technology that enables them to produce products at a significantly lower cost  our technology could be rendered uneconomical or obsolete 
moreover  the sulphate based titanium dioxide technology used by our pigments business is widely available 
accordingly  barriers to entry  apart from capital availability  may be low and the entrance of new 
table of contents competitors into the industry may reduce our ability to capture improving profit margins in circumstances where capacity utilization in the industry is increasing

for the years ended december   and  our capital expenditures for ehs matters totaled million  million and million  respectively 
because capital expenditures for these matters are subject to evolving regulatory requirements and depend  in part  on the timing  promulgation and enforcement of specific requirements  our capital expenditures for ehs matters have varied significantly from year to year and we cannot provide assurance that our recent expenditures will be indicative of future amounts required under ehs laws 

table of contents remediation liabilities we have incurred  and we may in the future incur  liability to investigate and clean up waste or contamination at our current or former facilities or facilities operated by third parties at which we may have disposed of waste or other materials 
similarly  we may incur costs for the cleanup of waste that was disposed of prior to the purchase of our businesses 
under some circumstances  the scope of our liability may extend to damages to natural resources 
under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla and similar state laws  a current or former owner or operator of real property may be liable for remediation costs regardless of whether the release or disposal of hazardous substances was in compliance with law at the time it occurred  and a current owner or operator may be liable regardless of whether it owned or operated the facility at the time of the release 
outside the us  analogous contaminated property laws  such as those in effect in france and australia  can hold past owners and or operators liable for remediation at former facilities 
we have been notified by third parties of claims against us for cleanup liabilities at approximately former facilities or third party sites  including  but not limited to  sites listed under cercla 
based on current information and past experiences at other cercla sites  we do not expect any of these third party claims to result in material liability to us 
one of these sites  the north maybe canyon mine cercla site  includes an abandoned phosphorous mine near soda springs  idaho believed to have been operated by one of our predecessor companies el paso products company 
in  the us forest service notified us that we are a cercla potentially responsible party a prp for the mine site involving selenium contaminated surface water 
under a administrative order  the current mine lessee  nu west industries  inc  began undertaking the investigation required for a cercla removal process 
in  the site was transitioned to the cercla remedial action process  which requires a remedial investigation feasibility study an ri fs 
in  the forest service notified the three prps our company  nu west and wells cargo that it would undertake the ri fs itself 
on february   in conjunction with wells cargo  we agreed to jointly comply with a unilateral administrative order a uao to conduct an ri fs of the entire west ridge of the site  although we are alleged to have had only a limited historical presence in the investigation area 
in march  following the initiation of litigation by nu west  the forest service assumed nu west original investigation obligations 
on june   we received the uao which had been executed by the forest service and we are presently carrying out the requirements of the order 
we continue to coordinate with our insurers regarding policy coverage in this matter 
at this time  we are unable to estimate the cost of the ri fs or our ultimate liability in this matter  but we do not believe it will be material to our financial condition  results of operations or cash flow 
in addition  under the resource conservation and recovery act rcra and similar state laws  we may be required to remediate contamination originating from our properties as a condition to our hazardous waste permit 
some of our manufacturing sites have an extended history of industrial chemical manufacturing and use  including on site waste disposal 
we are aware of soil  groundwater or surface contamination from past operations at some of our sites  and we may find contamination at other sites in the future 
for example  our port neches  texas  and geismar  louisiana  facilities are the subject of ongoing remediation requirements under rcra authority 
similar laws exist in a number of locations in which we currently operate  or previously operated  manufacturing facilities  such as australia  switzerland and italy 
in june of  an agreement was reached between the local regulatory authorities and our advanced materials site in pamplona  spain to relocate our manufacturing operations in order to facilitate new urban development desired by the city 
subsequently  as required by the authorities  soil and groundwater sampling was performed and followed by a quantitative risk assessment 
in october 
table of contents  the local authorities approved our proposed two phase remedial approach 
the first phase  to be initiated in  will involve groundwater extraction and treatment in one limited area of the site 
the second phase  not yet defined  would proceed during site redevelopment 
however  because of the current economic conditions in spain  we believe that the urban development plans have been postponed for the immediate future 
therefore  we are unable to further assess the timing  likelihood or amount of any potential liability 
by letter dated march   our base chemicals and polymers facility in west footscray  australia  was issued a clean up notice by the environment protection authority  victoria  australia the epa victoria due to concerns about soil and groundwater contamination emanating from the site 
the agency revoked the original clean up notice on september  and issued a revised clean up notice due to the complexity of contamination issues at the site 
in the third quarter of  we recorded a million liability related to estimated environmental remediation costs at this site 
on august   epa victoria revoked the second clean up notice and issued a revised notice that included a requirement for financial assurance for the remediation 
we have now reached agreement with the agency that a mortgage on the land will be held by the agency as financial surety during the period of current clean up notice  which ends on july  we can provide no assurance that the agency will not seek to institute additional requirements for the site or that additional costs will not be associated with the clean up 
this facility has been closed and demolition  which commenced in may  is expected to be completed by mid by letter of march   the us department of justice the doj notified us that the epa has requested that the doj bring an action in federal court against us and other prps for recovery of costs incurred by the us in connection with releases of hazardous substances from the state marine superfund site in port arthur  texas 
as of august   the epa had incurred and paid approximately million in unreimbursed response costs related to the site 
prior to filing the complaint  the doj requested that prps sign and return a standard tolling agreement from march  through september  and participate in settlement discussions 
we originally responded to an information request regarding this site on march  and identified historical transactions associated with a predecessor of a company we acquired 
the prior owners have contractually agreed to indemnify us in this matter 
while the doj is aware of the indemnity  we may be required to participate in future settlement discussions  therefore  on march   we submitted the signed tolling agreement and offer to negotiate to the doj 
the tolling agreement has since been extended until march  in many cases  our potential liability arising from historical contamination is based on operations and other events occurring prior to our ownership of a business or specific facility 
in these situations  we frequently obtained an indemnity agreement from the prior owner addressing remediation liabilities arising from pre closing conditions 
we have successfully exercised our rights under these contractual covenants for a number of sites and  where applicable  mitigated our ultimate remediation liability 
we cannot assure you  however  that the liabilities for all such matters subject to indemnity  will be honored by the prior owner or that our existing indemnities will be sufficient to cover our liabilities for such matters 
based on available information and the indemnification rights we believe are likely to be available  we believe that the costs to investigate and remediate known contamination will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
however  if such indemnities are not honored or do not fully cover the costs of investigation and remediation or we are required to contribute to such costs  then such expenditures may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
at the current time  we are unable to estimate the total cost  exclusive of indemnification benefits  to remediate any of the known contamination sites 

table of contents environmental reserves we have accrued liabilities relating to anticipated environmental cleanup obligations  site reclamation and closure costs and known penalties 
liabilities are recorded when potential liabilities are either known or considered probable and can be reasonably estimated 
our liability estimates are calculated using present value techniques and are based upon requirements placed upon us by regulators  available facts  existing technology and past experience 
the environmental liabilities do not include amounts recorded as asset retirement obligations 
we had accrued million and million for environmental liabilities as of december  and  respectively 
of these amounts  million and million were classified as accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets as of december  and  respectively  and million and million were classified as other noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets as of december  and  respectively 
in certain cases  our remediation liabilities may be payable over periods of up to years 
we may incur losses for environmental remediation in excess of the amounts accrued  however  we are not able to estimate the amount or range of such potential excess 
regulatory developments in december  the eu parliament and eu council approved a new eu regulatory framework for chemicals called reach registration  evaluation and authorization of chemicals 
reach took effect on june   and the program it establishes will be phased in over years 
under the regulation  companies that manufacture in or import into the european economic area eea more than one metric tonne of a chemical substance per year will be required to register such chemical substances and isolated intermediates in a central database 
use authorizations will be granted for a specific chemical if the applicants can show that the risks in using the chemical are adequately controlled  and for chemicals where there are no suitable alternative substances or technologies available and the applicant can demonstrate that the social and economic benefits of using the chemical outweigh the risks 
in addition  specified uses of some hazardous substances may be restricted 
furthermore  all applicants will have to study the availability of alternative chemicals 
if an alternative is available  an applicant will have to submit a substitution plan to the regulatory agency 
the regulatory agency will only authorize persistent bio accumulative and toxic substances if an alternative chemical is not available 
the registration  evaluation and authorization phases of the program will require expenditures and resource commitments in order to  for example  participate in mandatory data sharing forums  acquire  generate and evaluate data  prepare and submit dossiers for substance registration  obtain legal advice and reformulate products  if necessary 
we have established a cross business european reach team that is working closely with our businesses to identify and list all substances we purchase or manufacture in  or import into  the eea 
we met pre registration reach compliance requirements by the november  regulatory deadline  with the exception of pre registrations for two substances  for a total of  pre registrations for substances that we intended to register 
these two substances  along with the other high volume and high priority chemicals  were successfully registered under the program by the november  regulatory deadline 
although the total long term cost for reach compliance is not estimable at this time  we spent approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively  on reach compliance 
however  we cannot provide assurance that these recent expenditures will be indicative of future amounts required for reach compliance 
greenhouse gas regulation although the existence of binding emissions limitations under international treaties such as the kyoto protocol is in doubt after  we expect some or all of our operations to be subject to regulatory requirements to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases ghg 
even in the absence of a new global agreement to limit ghgs  we may be subject to additional regulation under the european 
table of contents union emissions trading system as well as new national and regional ghg trading programs 
for example  our operations in australia and selected us states may be subject to future ghg regulations under emissions trading systems in those jurisdictions 
because the united states has not adopted federal climate change legislation  domestic ghg efforts are likely to be guided by epa regulations in the near future 
while epa ghg programs are currently subject to judicial challenge  our domestic operations may become subject to epa regulatory requirements when implemented 
in particular  expansions of our existing facilities or construction of new facilities may be subject to the clean air act prevention of significant deterioration requirements under epa ghg tailoring rule 
in addition  certain aspects of our operations may be subject to ghg emissions monitoring and reporting requirements 
if we are subject to epa ghg regulations  we may face increased monitoring  reporting  and compliance costs 
we are already managing and reporting ghg emissions  to varying degrees  as required by law for our sites in locations subject to kyoto protocol obligations and or eu emissions trading scheme requirements 
although these sites are subject to existing ghg legislation  few have experienced or anticipate significant cost increases as a result of these programs  although it is possible that ghg emission restrictions may increase over time 
potential consequences of such restrictions include capital requirements to modify assets to meet ghg emission restrictions and or increases in energy costs above the level of general inflation  as well as direct compliance costs 
currently  however  it is not possible to estimate the likely financial impact of potential future regulation on any of our sites 
finally  it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of ghg in the earth atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects  such as increased frequency and severity of storms  droughts  and floods and other climatic events 
if any of those effects were to occur  they could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations 
chemical facility anti terrorism rulemaking the us department of homeland security dhs issued the final rule of their chemical facility anti terrorism standard in the initial phase of the rule required all chemical facilities in the us to evaluate their facilities against the dhs appendix a list of chemicals of interest 
facilities which have specified chemicals in threshold quantities on the appendix a list were required to submit a top screen questionnaire to dhs in in early  we submitted top screens for all of our covered facilities 
after reviewing the top screens  dhs determined that four of our sites were high risk facilities 
as a result  we were required to perform security vulnerability assessments at the high risk sites 
the security vulnerability assessments were completed and sent to dhs during the fourth quarter of based on their assessment of the security vulnerability assessments  we received notice from dhs that one of our sites was elevated to a high security risk tier 
the dhs determined the other three sites to be lower security risk tiers 
the three lower tiered sites have submitted site security plans ssps to the dhs 
the ssps are based on a list of risk based performance standards  but security improvements recommended from the ssps are not anticipated to be material 
the high tiered site also submitted an ssp to the dhs  and security upgrades as a result of dhs requirements are estimated to cost million to million to be spent during and mtbe developments we produce mtbe  an oxygenate that is blended with gasoline to reduce vehicle air emissions and to enhance the octane rating of gasoline 
litigation or legislative initiatives restricting the use of mtbe in gasoline may subject us or our products to environmental liability or materially adversely affect our sales and costs 
because mtbe has contaminated some water supplies  its use has become controversial in the us and elsewhere  and its use has been effectively eliminated in the us market 
we currently market mtbe  either directly or through third parties  to gasoline additive customers 
table of contents located outside the us  although there are additional costs associated with such outside us sales which may result in decreased profitability compared to historical sales in the us we may also elect to use all or a portion of our precursor tba to produce saleable products other than mtbe 
if we opt to produce products other than mtbe  necessary modifications to our facilities will require significant capital expenditures and the sale of such other products may produce a lower level of cash flow than that historically produced from the sale of mtbe 
numerous companies  including refiners  manufacturers and sellers of gasoline  as well as manufacturers of mtbe  have been named as defendants in numerous cases in us courts that allege mtbe contamination in groundwater 
the plaintiffs in the mtbe groundwater contamination cases generally seek compensatory damages  punitive damages  injunctive relief  such as monitoring and abatement  and attorney fees 
between and  we were named as a defendant in of these lawsuits in new york state and federal courts  which we settled in an amount immaterial to us 
it is possible that we could be named as a defendant in existing or future mtbe contamination cases 
we cannot provide assurances that adverse results against us in existing or future mtbe contamination cases will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial position 
india investigation during the third quarter of  we completed an internal investigation of the operations of petro araldite pvt 
ltd 
papl  our majority owned joint venture in india 
papl manufactures base liquid resins  base solid resins and formulated products in india 
the investigation initially focused on allegations of illegal disposal of hazardous waste and waste water discharge and related reporting irregularities 
based upon preliminary findings  the investigation was expanded to include a review of the production and off book sales of certain products and waste products 
the investigation included the legality under indian law and us law  including the us foreign corrupt practices act  of certain payments made by employees of the joint venture to government officials in india 
records at the facility covering nine months in and early show that less than  in payments were made to officials for that period  in addition  payments in unknown amounts may have been made by individuals from the facility in previous years 
in may and july  papl fully disclosed the environmental noncompliance issues to the local indian environmental agency  the tamil nadu pollution control board tnpcb 
all environmental compliance and reporting issues have been addressed to the agency satisfaction other than the use of freshwater for the dilution of wastewater effluent discharges and the remediation of several off site solid waste disposal areas 
also in may  we voluntarily contacted the sec and the doj to advise them of our investigation and that we intend to cooperate fully with each of them 
we met with the sec and the doj in early october to discuss this matter and continue to cooperate with these agencies 
steps have been taken to halt all known illegal or improper activity 
these steps included the termination of employment of management employees as appropriate 
in november  directions were received from tnpcb to submit a plan for the remediation of the off site waste disposal areas 
no conclusions can be drawn at this time as to whether any government agencies will open formal investigations of these matters or what remedies such agencies may seek 
governmental agencies could assess material civil and criminal penalties and fines against papl and potentially against us and could issue orders that adversely affect the operations of papl 
we cannot  however  determine at this time the magnitude of the penalties and fines that could be assessed  the total costs to remediate the prior noncompliance or the effects of implementing any necessary corrective measures on the papl operations

table of contents item a 
risk factors any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
risks related to our business our industry is affected by global economic factors including risks associated with volatile economic conditions 
our financial results are substantially dependent upon overall economic conditions in the united states  the european union and asia 
declining economic conditions in all or any of these locations or negative perceptions about economic conditions could result in a substantial decrease in demand for our products and could adversely affect our business 
uncertain economic conditions and market instability make it difficult for us  our customers and our suppliers to forecast demand trends 
renewed declines in demand would place additional pressure on our results of operations 
the timing and extent of any changes to currently prevailing market conditions is uncertain and supply and demand may be unbalanced at any time 
as a consequence  we are unable to accurately predict future economic conditions or the effect of such conditions on our financial condition or results of operations  and we can give no assurances as to the timing  extent or duration of the current or future economic cycles impacting the chemical industry 
future acquisitions  partnerships and joint ventures may require significant resources and or result in unanticipated adverse consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and or financial condition 
in the future we may seek to grow by making acquisitions or entering into partnerships and joint ventures 
any future acquisition  partnership or joint venture may require that we make a significant cash investment  issue stock or incur substantial debt 
in addition  acquisitions  partnerships or investments may require significant managerial attention  which may be diverted from our other operations 
these capital  equity and managerial commitments may impair the operation of our businesses 
any future acquisitions of businesses or facilities could entail a number of additional risks  including the inability to maintain key pre acquisition business relationships  increased operating costs  exposure to unanticipated liabilities  usage of limited investment and other baskets under our debt covenants  pre existing or ongoing illegal activities conducted by the target company or joint venture partner  and difficulties in realizing projected efficiencies  synergies and cost savings 
we have incurred indebtedness to finance past acquisitions 
we may finance future acquisitions with additional indebtedness 
we could face financial risks associated with incurring additional indebtedness  such as reducing our liquidity and access to financial markets and increasing the amount of cash flow required to service indebtedness  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents significant price volatility or interruptions in supply of our raw materials may result in increased costs that we may be unable to pass on to our customers  which could reduce our profitability 
the prices of the raw materials that we purchase from third parties are cyclical and volatile 
we purchase a substantial portion of these raw materials from third party suppliers 
the cost of these raw materials represents a substantial portion of our operating expenses 
the prices for a number of these raw materials generally follow price trends of  and vary with market conditions for  crude oil and natural gas feedstocks  which are highly volatile and cyclical 
the feedstocks and other raw materials we consume are generally commodity products that are readily available at market prices 
we frequently enter into supply agreements with particular suppliers  but disruptions of existing supply arrangements could substantially impact our profitability 
if certain of our suppliers are unable to meet their obligations under present supply agreements  we may be forced to pay higher prices to obtain the necessary raw materials from other sources and we may not be able to increase prices for our finished products to recoup the higher raw materials costs 
in addition  if any of the raw materials that we use become unavailable within the geographic area from which they are now sourced  then we may not be able to obtain suitable or cost effective substitutes 
any interruption in the supply of raw materials could increase our costs or decrease our revenues  which could reduce our cash flow 
our supply agreements typically provide for market based pricing and provide us only limited protection against price volatility 
while we attempt to match cost increases with corresponding product price increases  we are not always able to raise product prices immediately or at all 
timing differences between raw material prices  which may change daily  and contract product prices  which in many cases are negotiated only monthly or less often  have had and may continue to have a negative effect on our cash flow 
any cost increase that we are not able to pass on to our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
financial difficulties and related problems at our customers  vendors  suppliers and other business partners could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the recent economic downturn has caused financial problems at some customers  vendors  suppliers and business partners 
we rely on numerous vendors and suppliers and collaborations with other industry participants to provide us with chemicals  feedstocks and other raw materials  along with energy sources and  in certain cases  facilities  that we need to operate our business 
if the economic downturn were to continue or worsen  some of these companies may be forced to reduce their output  shut down their operations or file for bankruptcy protection 
if this were to occur  it could materially adversely affect their ability to provide us with the raw materials  energy sources or facilities that we need  which could disrupt our operations  including the production of certain of our products 
in addition  it could be difficult to find replacements for certain of our business partners without incurring significant delays or cost increases 
in addition  if the economic downturn were to continue or worsen  more of our customers may experience financial difficulties  including bankruptcies  restructurings and liquidations  which could affect our business by reducing sales  increasing our risk in extending trade credit to customers and reducing our profitability 
a significant adverse change in a customer relationship or in a customer financial position could cause us to limit or discontinue business with that customer  require us to assume more credit risk relating to that customer receivables or limit our ability to collect accounts receivable from that customer  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 

table of contents our available cash and access to additional capital may be limited by our significant leverage and the terms of our existing indebtedness  which could restrict our ability to grow our businesses 
we have a significant amount of indebtedness outstanding 
as of december   we had total consolidated outstanding indebtedness of approximately  million including the current portion of long term debt and a debt to total capitalization ratio of approximately 
our outstanding debt could have important consequences for our businesses  including the following a high degree of debt makes us more vulnerable to a downturn in our businesses  our industry and the economy in general  as a significant percentage of our cash flow from operations will be required to make payments on our indebtedness  making it more difficult to react to changes in our business and in market or industry conditions  a substantial portion of our future cash flow from operations may be required to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on indebtedness  thereby reducing the funds available for other purposes  including the growth of our businesses  our ability to obtain additional financing may be constrained due to our existing level of debt  particularly in the current credit environment  and part of our indebtedness is  and any future debt may be  subject to variable interest rates  which makes us vulnerable to increases in interest rates 
we require substantial capital to finance our operations and continued growth  and we may incur substantial additional debt from time to time for a variety of purposes  including acquiring additional businesses 
however  our existing debt instruments contain restrictive covenants 
among other things  these covenants limit or prohibit our ability to incur more debt  make prepayments of other debt  pay dividends  redeem stock or make other distributions  issue capital stock  make investments  create liens  enter into transactions with affiliates  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  merge or consolidate  and transfer or sell assets 
our debt instruments also require us to comply with certain financial covenants under certain circumstances 
for example  the leverage covenant the leverage covenant applicable to our million revolving facility the revolving facility under our senior secured credit facilities the senior credit facilities requires us to maintain a maximum senior secured debt to ebitda ratio of to when uncollateralized loans or letters of credit are outstanding under the revolving facility 
as of december   we were in compliance with the covenant 
however  if we violate this covenant  it could lead to an event of default under the senior credit facilities  which could require us to pay off the balance of the senior credit facilities in full and result in a loss of such facilities 
it may not be possible for us to replace the senior credit facilities with a substitute facility on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
we also must comply with certain receivable performance metrics under our million us accounts receivable securitization program us a r program and our million approximately million european accounts receivable program eu a r program  and  collectively with the us a r program  our a r program or a r programs 
failure to meet such metrics could lead to an early termination event and could require us to cease use of such facilities  prohibiting us from additional borrowings against our receivables  or  at the discretion of the lenders  requiring us to repay the a r programs in full 
an early termination event under our a r programs would also constitute an event of default under our senior credit facilities  which could require us to pay off the balance of the senior credit facilities in full and result in a loss of such facilities 
in summary  if debt under one or more of our facilities is accelerated  cross default provisions in our debt instruments would likely be triggered  which would likely have a material adverse impact on our financial condition 

table of contents as of december   the current portion of our long term debt to affiliates totaled approximately million 
as of december   we had combined outstanding variable rate borrowings of approximately billion 
assuming a increase in interest rates  without giving effect to any interest rate hedges or our cash balances  our annual interest rate expense would increase by approximately million 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or are otherwise unable to obtain the funds required to meet payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness  or if we otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants in the instruments governing our indebtedness  we could be in default under the terms of those instruments 
in the event of a default  a holder of the indebtedness could elect to declare all the funds borrowed under those instruments to be due and payable together with accrued and unpaid interest  the creditors under our senior credit facilities could elect to terminate their commitments thereunder  and we or one or more of our subsidiaries could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation 
any of the foregoing consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the industries in which we compete are highly competitive  and we may not be able to compete effectively with our competitors that have greater financial resources  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the industries in which we operate are highly competitive 
among our competitors are some of the world largest chemical companies and major integrated petroleum companies that have their own raw material resources 
changes in the competitive landscape could make it difficult for us to retain our leadership position in various products and markets throughout the world 
in addition  some of the companies with whom we compete may be able to produce products more economically than we can 
furthermore  some of our competitors have greater financial resources  which may enable them to invest significant capital into their businesses  including expenditures for research and development 
while we are engaged in a range of research and development programs to develop new products and processes  to improve and refine existing products and processes  and to develop new applications for existing products  the failure to develop new products  processes or applications could make us less competitive 
moreover  if any of our current or future competitors develops proprietary technology that enables them to produce products at a significantly lower cost  our technology could be rendered uneconomical or obsolete 
in addition  certain of our businesses use technology that is widely available 
accordingly  barriers to entry  apart from capital availability  may be low in certain product segments of our business  and the entrance of new competitors into the industry may reduce our ability to capture improving profit margins in circumstances where capacity utilization in the industry is increasing 
further  petroleum rich countries have become more significant participants in the petrochemical industry and may expand this role significantly in the future 
increased competition in any of our businesses could compel us to reduce the prices of our products  which could result in reduced profit margins and loss of market share and have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
our results of operations may be adversely affected by international business risks  including fluctuations in currency exchange rates  legal restrictions and taxes 
we conduct a majority of our business operations outside the us  and these operations are subject to risks normally associated with international operations 
these risks include the need to convert currencies that may be received for our products into currencies in which we purchase raw materials or pay for services  which could result in a gain or loss depending on fluctuations in exchange rates 
in addition  we translate our local currency financial results into us dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during the reporting period or the exchange rate at the end of that period 
during times of a strengthening us dollar  our reported international sales and earnings may be 
table of contents reduced because the local currency may translate into fewer us dollars 
because we currently have significant operations located outside the us  we are exposed to fluctuations in global currency rates which may result in gains or losses on our financial statements 
other risks of international operations include trade barriers  tariffs  exchange controls  national and regional labor strikes  social and political risks  general economic risks and required compliance with a variety of us and foreign laws  including tax laws and the foreign corrupt practices act 
in addition  although we maintain an anti corruption compliance program throughout the company  violations of our compliance program may result in criminal or civil sanctions  including material monetary fines  penalties and other costs against us or our employees  and may have a material adverse effect on our business 
furthermore  in foreign jurisdictions where process of law may vary from country to country  we may experience difficulty in enforcing agreements 
in jurisdictions where bankruptcy laws and practices may vary  we may experience difficulty collecting foreign receivables through foreign legal systems 
the occurrence of these risks  among others  could disrupt the businesses of our international subsidiaries  which could significantly affect their ability to make distributions to us 
we operate in a significant number of jurisdictions  which contributes to the volatility of our effective tax rate 
changes in tax laws or the interpretation of tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate may affect our effective tax rate 
in addition  generally accepted accounting principles in the us gaap or us gaap has required us to place valuation allowances against our net operating losses and other deferred tax assets in a number of tax jurisdictions 
these valuation allowances primarily result from analysis of positive and negative evidence supporting the realization of tax benefits 
negative evidence includes a cumulative history of pre tax operating losses in those specific tax jurisdictions 
valuation allowances have resulted in material fluctuations in our effective tax rate 
economic conditions may dictate the continued imposition of the current valuation allowances and potentially the establishment of new valuation allowances 
while significant valuation allowances remain  our effective tax rate will likely continue to experience significant fluctuations 
demand for many of our products is cyclical  and we may experience depressed market conditions for such products 
historically  the markets for many of our products have experienced alternating periods of tight supply  causing prices and profit margins to increase  followed by periods of capacity additions  resulting in oversupply and declining prices and profit margins 
the volatility these markets experience occurs as a result of changes in the supply and demand for products  changes in energy prices and changes in various other economic conditions around the world 
this cyclicality and volatility of our industry results in significant fluctuations in profits and cash flow from period to period and over the business cycle 
natural or other disasters could disrupt our business and result in loss of revenue or in higher expenses 
any serious disruption at any of our facilities due to hurricane  fire  earthquake  flood  terrorist attack or any other natural or man made disaster could impair our ability to use our facilities and have a material adverse impact on our revenues and increase our costs and expenses 
if there is a natural disaster or other serious disruption at any of these facilities  it could impair our ability to adequately supply our customers and negatively impact our operating results 
in addition  many of our current and potential customers are concentrated in specific geographic areas 
a disaster in one of these regions could have a material adverse impact on our operations  operating results and financial condition 
while we maintain business recovery plans that are intended to allow us to recover from natural disasters or other events that could disrupt our business  we cannot provide assurances that our plans would fully protect us from all such disasters or events that might result due to climate change 
in addition  insurance may not adequately compensate us from any losses incurred as a result of natural 
table of contents or other disasters 
furthermore  in areas prone to frequent natural or other disasters  insurance may become increasingly expensive or not at all available 
our operations involve risks that may increase our operating costs  which could reduce our profitability 
although we take precautions to enhance the safety of our operations and minimize the risk of disruptions  our operations are subject to hazards inherent in the manufacturing and marketing of chemical products 
these hazards include chemical spills  pipeline leaks and ruptures  storage tank leaks  discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases and other hazards incident to the manufacturing  processing  handling  transportation and storage of dangerous chemicals 
we are also potentially subject to other hazards  including natural disasters and severe weather  explosions and fires  transportation problems  including interruptions  spills and leaks  mechanical failures  unscheduled downtimes  labor difficulties  remediation complications  and other risks 
many potential hazards can cause bodily injury and loss of life  severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage  and may result in suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties and liabilities 
furthermore  we are subject to present and future claims with respect to workplace exposure  exposure of contractors on our premises as well as other persons located nearby  workers compensation and other matters 
we maintain property  business interruption and casualty insurance policies which we believe are in accordance with customary industry practices  but we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business 
we maintain property damage and business interruption insurance policies and products liability insurance policies  as well as insurance policies covering other types of risks  including pollution legal liability insurance 
each of these insurance policies is subject to customary exclusions  deductibles and coverage limits  in accordance with industry standards and practices 
as a result of market conditions  premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase substantially and  in some instances  certain insurance may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage 
if we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
in addition  we are subject to various claims and litigation in the ordinary course of business 
we are a party to various pending lawsuits and proceedings 
it is possible that judgments could be rendered against us in these cases or others in which we could be uninsured or not covered by indemnity and beyond the amounts that we currently have reserved or anticipate incurring for such matters 
we might not be able to obtain funding if deterioration in the credit and capital markets were to occur 
this could hinder or prevent us from meeting our future capital needs and from refinancing our existing indebtedness when it comes due 
while global financial markets and economic conditions have improved  they continue to be volatile 
a deterioration of capital and credit markets could hinder our ability to access these markets 
if this were to occur  we cannot be certain that additional funding for our capital needs from credit and capital markets would be available if needed and  to the extent required  on acceptable terms 
in addition  we might be unable to refinance our existing indebtedness when it comes due on terms that are acceptable to us or at all 
if we were unable to meet our capital needs or refinance our existing indebtedness  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 

table of contents a downgrade in the ratings of the securities of our company or our subsidiaries could result in increased interest and other financial expenses related to future borrowings of our company or our subsidiaries and could restrict our access to additional capital or trade credit 
standard and poor ratings services and moody investors service maintain credit ratings for our company 
each of these ratings is currently below investment grade 
any decision by these or other ratings agencies  which may in the future rate our debt  to downgrade such ratings in the future could result in increased interest and other financial expenses relating to our future borrowings and could restrict our ability to obtain additional financing on satisfactory terms 
in addition  any downgrade could restrict our access to  and negatively impact the terms of  trade credit extended by our suppliers of raw materials 
we are subject to many ehs regulations that may result in unanticipated costs or liabilities  which could reduce our profitability 
we are subject to extensive federal  state  local and foreign laws  regulations  rules and ordinances relating to pollution  protection of the environment and human health  and the generation  storage  handling  transportation  treatment  disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and waste materials 
actual or alleged violations of ehs laws or permit requirements could result in restrictions or prohibitions on plant operations  substantial civil or criminal sanctions  as well as  under some ehs laws  the assessment of strict liability and or joint and several liability 
increasing concerns regarding the safety of chemicals in commerce and their potential impact on the environment constitute a growing trend 
governmental  regulatory and societal demands for increasing levels of product safety and environmental protection could result in increased pressure for more stringent regulatory control with respect to the chemical industry 
in addition  these concerns could influence public perceptions  the viability of certain products  our reputation  the cost to comply with regulations  and the ability to attract and retain employees 
moreover  changes in ehs regulations could inhibit or interrupt our operations  or require us to modify our facilities or operations 
accordingly  environmental or regulatory matters may cause us to incur significant unanticipated losses  costs or liabilities  which could reduce our profitability 
we could incur significant expenditures in order to comply with existing or future ehs laws 
capital expenditures and costs relating to ehs matters will be subject to evolving regulatory requirements and will depend on the timing of the promulgation and enforcement of specific standards which impose requirements on our operations 
capital expenditures and costs beyond those currently anticipated may therefore be required under existing or future ehs laws 
furthermore  we may be liable for the costs of investigating and cleaning up environmental contamination on or from our properties or at off site locations where we disposed of or arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous materials or from disposal activities that pre dated our purchase of our businesses 
we may therefore incur additional costs and expenditures beyond those currently anticipated to address all such known and unknown situations under existing and future ehs laws 
existing or future litigation or legislative initiatives restricting the use of mtbe in gasoline may subject us or our products to environmental liability  materially reduce our sales and or materially increase our costs 
we produce mtbe  an oxygenate that is blended with gasoline to reduce vehicle air emissions and to enhance the octane rating of gasoline 
litigation or legislative initiatives restricting the use of mtbe in gasoline may subject us or our products to environmental liability or materially adversely affect our sales and costs 
because mtbe has contaminated some water supplies  its use has become controversial in the us and elsewhere  and its use has been effectively eliminated in the us market 
we currently market mtbe  either directly or through third parties  to gasoline additive customers located outside the us  although there are additional costs associated with such outside us sales 
table of contents which may result in decreased profitability compared to historical sales in the us we may also elect to use all or a portion of our precursor tba to produce saleable products other than mtbe 
if we opt to produce products other than mtbe  necessary modifications to our facilities will require significant capital expenditures and the sale of such other products may produce a lower level of cash flow than that historically produced from the sale of mtbe 
numerous companies  including refiners  manufacturers and sellers of gasoline  as well as manufacturers of mtbe  have been named as defendants in numerous cases in us courts that allege mtbe contamination in groundwater 
the plaintiffs in the mtbe groundwater contamination cases generally seek compensatory damages  punitive damages  injunctive relief  such as monitoring and abatement  and attorney fees 
between and  we were named as a defendant in of these lawsuits in new york state and federal courts  which we settled in an amount immaterial to us 
it is possible that we could be named as a defendant in future mtbe contamination cases 
we cannot provide assurances that adverse results against us in future mtbe contamination cases will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial position 
failure to adequately protect critical data and technology systems could materially affect our operations 
information technology system failures  network disruptions and breaches of data security could disrupt our operations by causing delays or cancellation of customer orders  impeding the manufacture or shipment of products  processing transactions and reporting financial results  resulting in the unintentional disclosure of customer or our information  or damage to our reputation 
while management has taken steps to address these concerns by implementing network security and internal control measures  there can be no assurance that a system failure or data security breach will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 
our business is dependent on our intellectual property 
if our intellectual property rights cannot be enforced or our trade secrets become known to our competitors  our ability to compete may be adversely affected 
proprietary protection of our processes  apparatuses and other technology is important to our business 
while a presumption of validity exists with respect to patents issued to us in the us  there can be no assurance that any of our patents will not be challenged  invalidated  circumvented or rendered unenforceable 
furthermore  if any pending patent application filed by us does not result in an issued patent  or if patents are issued to us  but such patents do not provide meaningful protection of our intellectual property  then our ability to compete may be adversely affected 
additionally  our competitors or other third parties may obtain patents that restrict or preclude our ability to lawfully produce or sell our products in a competitive manner  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
we also rely upon unpatented proprietary know how and continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position 
while it is our policy to enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property  these confidentiality agreements may be breached  may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or proprietary know how  or adequate remedies may not be available in the event of an unauthorized access  use or disclosure of our trade secrets and know how 
in addition  others could obtain knowledge of our trade secrets through independent development or other access by legal means 
consequently  we may have to rely on judicial enforcement of our patents and other proprietary rights 
we may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights from misappropriation or infringement in countries where effective patent  trademark  trade secret and other intellectual property laws and judicial systems may be unavailable  or may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as us law 

table of contents the failure of our patents or confidentiality agreements to protect our processes  apparatuses  technology  trade secrets or proprietary know how or the failure of adequate legal remedies for related actions could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
loss of key members of our management could disrupt our business 
we depend on the continued employment and performance of our senior executives and other key members of management 
if any of these individuals resigns or becomes unable to continue in his or her present role and is not adequately replaced  our business operations and our ability to implement our growth strategies could be materially disrupted 
we generally do not have employment agreements with  and we do not maintain any key person life insurance for  any of our executive officers 
conflicts  military actions  terrorist attacks and general instability throughout the world  and in particular in certain energy producing nations  along with increased security regulations related to our industry  could adversely affect our business 
in the past  conflicts  military actions and terrorist attacks have precipitated global economic instability and turmoil in world financial markets 
current regional tensions and conflicts in energy producing nations  including continuing instability in iran  ongoing military action in iraq  and other conflicts have caused  and may cause further  increases in raw material costs  particularly natural gas and crude oil based feedstocks  which are used in our operations 
the uncertainty surrounding the threat of further armed hostilities  military action or acts of terrorism may impact any or all of our physical facilities and operations  which are located in north america  europe  australia  asia  africa  south america and the middle east  or those of our suppliers or customers 
furthermore  the resulting economic disruption caused by such events may result in reduced demand from our customers for our products 
a military action or terrorist attack that impacts any of our facilities  or the facilities of our suppliers or customers  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  a number of governments have begun regulatory processes that could lead to new regulations impacting the security of chemical plant locations and the transportation of hazardous chemicals  which could result in higher operating costs 
conflicts and stability will subject our worldwide operations to increased risks and  depending on their magnitude  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
if our subsidiaries do not make sufficient distributions to us  then we will not be able to make payment on our debts 
our debt is generally the exclusive obligation of huntsman international and our guarantor subsidiaries 
because a significant portion of our operations are conducted by non guarantor subsidiaries  our cash flow and our ability to service indebtedness  including our ability to pay the interest on our debt when due and principal of such debt at maturity  are dependent to a large extent upon cash dividends and distributions or other transfers from such non guarantor subsidiaries 
any payment of dividends  distributions  loans or advances by our non guarantor subsidiaries to us could be subject to restrictions on dividends or repatriation of earnings under applicable local law  monetary transfer restrictions and foreign currency exchange regulations in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate  and any restrictions imposed by the current and future debt instruments of our non guarantor subsidiaries 
in addition  payments to us by our subsidiaries are contingent upon our subsidiaries earnings 
our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and  except for our guarantor subsidiaries  have no obligation  contingent or otherwise  to pay any amounts due on our debt or to make any funds 
table of contents available for those amounts  whether by dividends  loans  distributions or other payments  and do not guarantee the payment of interest on  or principal of  our debt 
any right that we have to receive any assets of any of our subsidiaries that are not guarantors upon the liquidation or reorganization of any such subsidiary  and the consequent right of holders of notes to realize proceeds from the sale of their assets  will be structurally subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary creditors  including trade creditors and holders of debt issued by that subsidiary 
regulatory requirements to reduce ghg emissions could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
although the continued existence of binding emissions limitations under international treaties such as the kyoto protocol is in doubt after  we expect some of our operations to be subject to regulatory requirements to reduce ghg emissions 
even in the absence of a new global agreement to limit ghgs  we may be subject to additional regulation under the european union emissions trading system as well as new national and regional ghg trading programs 
for example  our operations in australia and selected us states may be subject to future ghg regulations under emissions trading systems in those jurisdictions 
because the united states has not adopted federal climate change legislation  domestic ghg efforts are likely to be guided by epa and state agency regulations in the near future 
while epa ghg programs are currently subject to judicial challenge  our domestic operations may become subject to epa regulatory requirements when implemented 
in particular  expansions of our existing facilities or construction of new facilities may be subject to the clean air act prevention of significant deterioration requirements under epa ghg tailoring rule 
in addition  certain aspects of our operations may be subject to ghg emissions monitoring and reporting requirements 
if we are subject to epa ghg regulations  we may face increased monitoring  reporting  and compliance costs 
we are already managing and reporting ghg emissions  to varying degrees  as required by law for our sites in locations subject to kyoto protocol obligations and or eu emissions trading scheme requirements 
although these sites are subject to existing ghg legislation  few have experienced or anticipate significant cost increases as a result of these programs  although it is possible that ghg emission restrictions may increase over time 
potential consequences of such restrictions include capital costs to modify assets as necessary to meet ghg emission limits and or increases in energy costs above the level of general inflation  as well as direct compliance costs 
currently  however  it is not possible to estimate the likely financial impact of potential future regulation on any of our sites 
finally  it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of ghgs in the earth atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects  such as increased frequency and severity of storms  droughts  floods and other climatic events 
if any of those effects were to occur  they could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations 
risks related to our common stock and debt securities our stock price has been and may continue to be subject to large fluctuations 
we have experienced significant fluctuations in our stock price and share trading volume in the past and may continue to do so 
the trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of issues  including broad market factors that may have a material adverse impact on our stock price  regardless of actual performance 
the following factors could affect our stock price periodic variations in the actual or anticipated financial results of our business or that of our competitors  downward revisions in securities analysts estimates of our future operating results or of the future operating results of our competitors  
table of contents material announcements by us or our competitors  public sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock  and adverse changes in general market conditions or economic trends or in conditions or trends in the markets in which we operate 
shares available for future sale may cause our common stock price to decline  which may negatively impact the trading price of our common stock 
sales of substantial numbers of additional shares of our common stock  or the perception that such sales could occur  may cause prevailing market prices for shares of our common stock to decline 
we have the ability to issue additional equity securities  which would lead to further dilution of our issued and outstanding common stock 
the issuance of additional equity securities would result in dilution of then existing stockholders equity interests in us 
our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors  without stockholder approval  to establish one or more series of preferred stock and to determine  with respect to any series of preferred stock  the number of shares in that series and the terms  rights and limitations of that series 
if we issue convertible notes or convertible preferred stock  a subsequent conversion may dilute the current common stockholders interest 
our board of directors has no present intention of issuing any such convertible instruments  but reserves the right to do so in the future 
in addition  we may issue additional shares of common stock under our equity incentive plans 
certain provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could discourage a takeover attempt  which may reduce or eliminate the likelihood of a change of control transaction and  therefore  limit your ability to sell our common stock at a price higher than the current market value 
certain provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  such as a classified board of directors  limitations on stockholder proposals at meetings of stockholders and the inability of stockholders to call special meetings and certain provisions of delaware law  could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of our company  even if some of our stockholders considered such a change of control to be beneficial 
our certificate of incorporation also authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval 
therefore  our board of directors could elect to issue preferred stock that has special voting or other rights that could make it even more difficult for a third party to acquire us  which may reduce or eliminate your ability to sell our common stock at a price higher than the current market value 
the declaration of dividends by our company is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and limitations under delaware law  and there can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends 
over the past four years we have paid quarterly dividends on our common stock 
the declaration of dividends by our company is subject to the discretion of our board of directors 
our board of directors takes into account such matters as general business conditions  our financial results  expected liquidity and capital expenditure requirements  contractual  legal or regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends  the effect on our debt ratings and such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant  and we can provide no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends on our common stock 
in addition  delaware law contains certain restrictions on a company ability to pay cash dividends and we can provide no assurance that those restrictions will not prevent us from paying a dividend in future periods

table of contents item legal proceedings environmental enforcement proceedings on occasion  we receive notices of violation  enforcement or other complaints from regulatory agencies alleging non compliance with applicable ehs laws 
based on currently available information and our past experience  we do not believe that the resolution of any pending or threatened environmental enforcement proceedings will have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
during the period from through  our performance products business surfactants manufacturing facility located in new south wales  australia experienced five reported releases of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide  both raw materials used in the surfactants manufacturing process 
as a consequence of these releases  the site received and responded to information requests and physical inspections from workcover nsw and or the department of environment  climate change and water nsw  both regulatory agencies with oversight authority for the facility 
subsequent to these inquiries  by letter dated september   the department of environment  climate change and water nsw notified us that it had commenced a court proceeding regarding the fifth ethylene oxide release which occurred on october  the authorities alleged a breach of a condition of our operating license  but have not alleged that a pollution event occurred 
although the facility submitted a good faith proposal to settle the matter  the agency elected instead to continue with the proceeding 
consequently  on december   we pled guilty to the one allegation of a breach of our operating license 
a one day sentencing hearing of the agreed to facts and supporting evidence is set for march  asbestos litigation we have been named as a premises defendant in a number of asbestos exposure cases  typically claims by non employees of exposure to asbestos while at a facility 
in the past  these cases typically have involved multiple plaintiffs bringing actions against multiple defendants  and the complaints have not indicated which plaintiffs were making claims against which defendants  where or how the alleged injuries occurred or what injuries each plaintiff claimed 
these facts  which would be central to any estimate of probable loss  generally have been learned only through discovery 
where a claimant alleged exposure occurred prior to our ownership of the relevant premises  the prior owners generally have contractually agreed to retain liability for  and to indemnify us against  asbestos exposure claims 
this indemnification is not subject to any time or dollar amount limitations 
upon service of a complaint in one of these cases  we tender it to the prior owner 
none of the complaints in these cases state the amount of damages being sought 
the prior owner accepts responsibility for the conduct of the defense of the cases and payment of any amounts due to the claimants 
in our fourteen year experience with tendering these cases  we have not made any payment with respect to any tendered asbestos cases 
we believe that the prior owners have the intention and ability to continue to honor their indemnity obligations  although we cannot assure you that they will continue to do so or that we will not be liable for these cases if they do not 

table of contents the following table presents for the periods indicated certain information about cases for which service has been received that we have tendered to the prior owner  all of which have been accepted 
year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  unresolved at beginning of period tendered during period resolved during period unresolved at end of period although the indemnifying party informs us when tendered cases have been resolved  it generally does not inform us of the settlement amounts relating to such cases  if any 
the indemnifying party has informed us that it typically manages our defense together with the defense of other entities in such cases and resolves claims involving multiple defendants simultaneously  and that it considers the allocation of settlement amounts  if any  among defendants to be confidential and proprietary 
consequently  we are not able to provide the number of cases resolved with payment by the indemnifying party or the amount of such payments 
we have never made any payments with respect to these cases 
as of december   we had an accrued liability of million relating to these cases and a corresponding receivable of million relating to our indemnity protection with respect to these cases 
we cannot assure you that our liability will not exceed our accruals or that our liability associated with these cases would not be material to our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity  accordingly  we are not able to estimate the amount or range of loss in excess of our accruals 
additional asbestos exposure claims may be made against us in the future  and such claims could be material 
however  because we are not able to estimate the amount or range of losses associated with such claims  we have made no accruals with respect to unasserted asbestos exposure claims as of december  certain cases in which we are a premises defendant are not subject to indemnification by prior owners or operators 
the following table presents for the periods indicated certain information about these cases 
cases include all cases for which service has been received by us

table of contents antitrust matters we have been named as a defendant in civil class action antitrust suits alleging that between and we conspired with bayer  basf  dow and lyondell to fix the prices of mdi  tdi  polyether polyols  and related systems polyether polyol products sold in the us in violation of the federal sherman act 
these cases are consolidated as the polyether polyols cases in multidistrict litigation known as in re urethane antitrust litigation  mdl no 
 civil no 
md jwl djw  pending in the us district court for the district of kansas 
in addition  we and the other polyether polyol defendants have also been named as defendants in three civil antitrust suits brought by certain direct purchasers of polyether polyol products that opted out of the class certified in mdl no 
while these opt out plaintiffs make similar claims as the class plaintiffs  the court denied defendants motion to dismiss claims of improper activity outside the class period 
accordingly  the relevant time frame for these cases is these cases are referred to as the direct action cases and are pending in the us district court for the district of new jersey 
merits discovery was consolidated in mdl no 
for both the class and direct action cases and is ongoing 
the trial is currently scheduled for may two purported class action cases filed may and  pending in the superior court of justice  ontario canada and superior court  province of quebec  district of quebec  by direct purchasers of mdi  tdi and polyether polyols and by indirect purchasers of these products remain largely dormant although the plaintiff in one case recently filed papers seeking class certification 
a purported class action case filed february  by purchasers of products containing rubber and urethanes products and pending in superior court of california  county of san francisco is stayed pending resolution of mdl no 
finally  we have been named in a proposed third amended complaint by indirect purchasers of mdi  tdi  polyether polyols and polyester polyols pending against bayer and chemtura in the us district court for the district of massachusetts 
the matter is currently stayed pending a settlement of previously asserted claims against bayer and chemtura 
we opposed the motion for leave to file the proposed amended complaint adding us as a defendant in that action 
the plaintiffs in each of these matters make similar claims against the defendants as the class plaintiffs in mdl no 
we have been named as a defendant in two purported class action civil antitrust suits alleging that we and our co defendants and other co conspirators conspired to fix prices of titanium dioxide sold in the us between at least march  and the present 
the cases were filed on february and  in the us district court for the district of maryland and a consolidated complaint was filed on april  the other defendants named in this matter are ei du pont de nemours and company  kronos worldwide inc  millennium inorganic chemicals  inc and the national titanium dioxide company limited d b a cristal 
together with our co defendants we have filed a motion to dismiss this litigation 
in all of the antitrust litigation currently pending against us  the plaintiffs generally are seeking injunctive relief  treble damages  costs of suit and attorneys fees 
the plaintiffs pleadings in these various antitrust suits provide few specifics about any alleged illegal conduct on our part  and we are not aware of any illegal conduct by us or any of our employees 
nevertheless  we have incurred costs related to these claims and could incur additional costs in amounts material to us 
port arthur plant fire insurance litigation settlement on april   our former port arthur  texas olefins manufacturing plant which we sold to flint hills resources in november experienced a major fire 
the plant was covered by property damage and business interruption insurance through international risk insurance company iric  
table of contents our captive insurer  and certain reinsurers the reinsurers 
the property damage and business interruption insurance was subject to a combined deductible of million 
we  together with iric  asserted claims to the reinsurers related to losses occurring as a result of this fire 
on august   the reinsurers brought an action against us in the us district court for the southern district of texas 
the action sought to compel us to arbitrate with the reinsurers to resolve disputes related to our claims or  in the alternative  to declare judgment in favor of the reinsurers 
pursuant to a december  agreement  we participated with the reinsurers in binding arbitration

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a global manufacturer of differentiated organic chemical products and of inorganic chemical products 
our products comprise a broad range of chemicals and formulations  which we market globally to a diversified group of consumer and industrial customers 
our products are used in a wide range of applications  including those in the adhesives  aerospace  automotive  construction products  durable and non durable consumer products  electronics  medical  packaging  paints and coatings  power generation  refining  synthetic fiber  textile chemicals and dye industries 
we are a leading global producer in many of our key product lines  including mdi  amines  surfactants  epoxy based polymer formulations  textile chemicals  dyes  maleic anhydride and titanium dioxide 
our administrative  research and development and manufacturing operations are primarily conducted at the facilities listed in item properties above  which are located in countries 
we employed approximately  associates worldwide at december  we operate in five segments polyurethanes  performance products  advanced materials  textile effects and pigments 
our polyurethanes  performance products  advanced materials and textile effects segments produce differentiated organic chemical products and our pigments segment produces inorganic chemical products 
in a series of transactions beginning in  we have sold or shutdown substantially all of our former australian styrenics  polymers and base chemicals operations 
we report the results from our former australian styrenics  polymers and base chemicals businesses as discontinued operations 
see note discontinued operations to our consolidated financial statements 
growth in our polyurethanes  advanced materials and textile effects segments has been driven by the continued substitution of our products for other materials across a broad range of applications  as well as by the level of global economic activity 
historically  demand for many of these products has grown at rates in excess of gdp growth 
in polyurethanes  this growth  driven largely by asia  has in recent years resulted in improved demand and higher industry capacity utilization rates for many of our key products  including mdi 
in our performance products segment  demand for our performance specialties has generally continued to grow at rates in excess of gdp as overall demand is significantly influenced by new product and application development 
demand for most of our performance intermediates has grown in line with gdp growth 
over time  demand for maleic anhydride has generally grown at rates that slightly exceed gdp growth 
however  given its dependence on the upr market  which is influenced by construction end markets  maleic anhydride demand can be cyclical 
historically  demand for titanium dioxide pigments has grown at rates approximately equal to global gdp growth 
pigment prices have historically reflected industry wide operating rates but have typically lagged behind movements in these rates by up to twelve months due to the effects of product stocking and destocking by customers and producers  contract arrangements and seasonality 
the industry experiences some seasonality in its sales because sales of paints  the largest end use for titanium dioxide  generally peak during the spring and summer months in the northern hemisphere 
this results in greater sales volumes in the second and third quarters of the year 
in january  we idled our po mtbe production facility at port neches  texas for turnaround and inspection 
this planned shutdown concluded on march  the financial impact on our first quarter results was estimated to be approximately million  including unabsorbed fixed costs 
for further information regarding sales price and demand trends  see results of operations segment analysis year over prior year increase decrease and results of operations segment analysis fourth quarter vs 
third quarter increase decrease below 

table of contents outlook we believe that global demand for most of our products is recovering and underlying trends within our businesses are also encouraging 
average selling prices increased sequentially on an annual and quarterly basis within our largest businesses and our capacity utilization rates are improving on a seasonally adjusted basis 
early indicators for give us a high degree of optimism that we will continue to see improving markets globally 
nevertheless  we recognize that there are significant continuing economic risks that could materially impact our earnings performance 
while we anticipate that our raw material and energy costs will remain at elevated levels in response to increased demand  we expect our margins will continue to strengthen over the next few years 
our management believes that our strategic and financial approach to the operation of our business focusing on growth in asia and other emerging markets and debt reduction will provide us a foundation for long term earnings growth 
given current improving global economic trends  it appears reasonable that we could achieve adjusted ebitda of  million within the next two to three years

we believe that ebitda enhances an investor understanding of our financial performance 
however  ebitda should not be considered in isolation or viewed as a substitute for net income attributable to huntsman corporation or huntsman international llc  as appropriate  or other measures of performance as defined by gaap 
moreover  ebitda as used herein is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation 
our management uses ebitda to assess financial performance by reviewing ebitda as a general indicator of economic performance compared with prior periods 
because ebitda excludes interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  ebitda provides an indicator of general economic performance that is not affected by debt restructurings  fluctuations in interest rates or effective tax rates  or levels of depreciation and amortization 
accordingly  our management believes this type of measurement is useful for comparing general operating performance from period to period and making certain related management decisions 
ebitda is also used by securities analysts  lenders and others in their evaluation of different companies because it excludes certain items that can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry 
for example  interest expense can be highly dependent on a company capital structure  debt levels and credit ratings 
therefore  the impact of interest expense on earnings can vary significantly among companies 
in addition  the tax positions of companies can vary because of their differing abilities to take advantage of tax benefits and because of 
table of contents the tax policies of the various jurisdictions in which they operate 
as a result  effective tax rates and tax expense can vary considerably among companies 
finally  companies employ productive assets of different ages and utilize different methods of acquiring and depreciating such assets 
this can result in considerable variability in the relative costs of productive assets and the depreciation and amortization expense among companies 
nevertheless  our management recognizes that there are material limitations associated with the use of ebitda in the evaluation of our company as compared to net income attributable to huntsman corporation or huntsman international llc  as appropriate  which reflects overall financial performance  including the effects of interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
ebitda excludes interest expense 
because we have borrowed money in order to finance our operations  interest expense is a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate revenue 
therefore  any measure that excludes interest expense has material limitations 
ebitda also excludes taxes 
because the payment of taxes is a necessary element of our operations  any measure that excludes tax expense has material limitations 
finally  ebitda excludes depreciation and amortization expense 
because we use capital assets  depreciation and amortization expense is a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate revenue 
therefore  any measure that excludes depreciation and amortization expense has material limitations 
our management compensates for the limitations of using ebitda by using it to supplement gaap results to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the business rather than gaap results alone 
our management also uses other metrics to evaluate capital structure  tax planning and capital investment decisions 
for example  our management uses credit ratings and net debt ratios to evaluate capital structure  effective tax rate by jurisdiction to evaluate tax planning  and payback period and internal rate of return to evaluate capital investments 
our management also uses trade working capital to evaluate its investment in accounts receivable and inventory  net of accounts payable 
adjusted ebitda is computed by eliminating the following from ebitda unallocated foreign exchange gains or losses  loss or gain on early extinguishment of debt  legal settlements  loss on accounts receivable securitization programs for periods prior to january   ebitda from discontinued operations  acquisition costs  expenses income associated with the terminated merger and related litigation  gain on sale of a business  extraordinary loss gain on the acquisition of a business  and restructuring  impairment and plant closing costs 
adjusted ebitda is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure to ebitda and reported gaap measures because we believe that it is indicative of our operating performance and is frequently used as a valuation measure of chemical companies 
our management also uses adjusted ebitda to evaluate the core operating performance of our segments and business 
in addition to the limitations of ebitda noted above  adjusted ebitda excludes items that may be recurring in nature and should not be disregarded in the evaluation of performance 
however  we believe it is useful to exclude such items to provide a supplemental analysis of current results and trends compared to other periods for the following reasons certain excluded items can vary significantly depending on specific underlying transactions or events  and the variability of such items may not relate specifically to current operating results or trends  and certain excluded items  while potentially recurring in future periods  may not be indicative of future results 
adjusted ebitda should not be construed as an alternative to net income applicable to huntsman corporation or huntsman international  as appropriate  as an indicator of performance  or as any other measure determined in accordance with gaap 
we believe that net income loss attributable to huntsman corporation or huntsman international  as appropriate  is the performance measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap that is most directly comparable to ebitda and adjusted ebitda

the income tax impacts of each aforementioned item was calculated using the statutory rates in the applicable taxing jurisdiction and considering valuation allowances on deferred tax assets in each jurisdiction

table of contents compliance with covenants our management believes that we are in compliance with the covenants contained in the agreements governing our material debt instruments  including our senior credit facilities  our a r programs and our notes 
our senior credit facilities are subject to a single financial covenant  the leverage covenant  which applies only to the revolving facility and is tested at the huntsman international level 
the leverage covenant is applicable only if borrowings  letters of credit or guarantees are outstanding under the revolving facility cash collateralized letters of credit or guarantees are not deemed outstanding 
the leverage covenant is a net senior secured leverage ratio covenant which requires that huntsman international ratio of senior secured debt to ebitda as defined in the applicable agreement is not more than to if in the future huntsman international failed to comply with the leverage covenant  then we would not have access to liquidity under our revolving facility 
if huntsman international failed to comply with the leverage covenant at a time when we had uncollateralized loans or letters of credit outstanding under the revolving facility  huntsman international would be in default under the senior credit facilities  and  unless huntsman international obtained a waiver or forbearance with respect to such default as to which we can provide no assurance  huntsman international could be required to pay off the balance of the senior credit facilities in full  and we may not have further access to such facilities 
the agreements governing our a r programs also contain certain receivable performance metrics 
any material failure to meet the applicable a r program metrics in the future could lead to an early termination event under the a r programs  which could require us to cease our use of such facilities  prohibiting us from additional borrowings against our receivables  or at the discretion of the lenders  repay the a r programs in full 
an early termination event under the a r programs would also constitute an event of default under our senior credit facilities  which could require us to pay off the balance of the senior credit facilities in full and could result in the loss of our senior credit facilities 
short term and long term liquidity we depend upon our cash  credit facilities  a r programs and other debt instruments to provide liquidity for our operations and working capital needs 
as of december   we had  million of combined cash and unused borrowing capacity  consisting of million in cash and restricted cash  million in availability under our revolving facility  and million in availability under our a r programs

the following matters had  or are expected to have  a significant impact on our liquidity our accounts receivable excluding the million effect of the on balance sheet treatment of our a r programs and inventory  net of accounts payable  increased by approximately million in  as reflected in our consolidated statement of cash flows 
we expect volatility in our working capital components to continue 
on march   huntsman international entered into the fifth amendment to the senior credit facilities 
among other things  this amendment limits the aggregate amount of revolving commitments allowable under the revolving facility to an amount up to million 
as of december   the aggregate amount of revolving commitments available under the revolving facility was million 
there are currently no borrowings under the revolving facility  and we have approximately million us dollar equivalents of letters of credit and bank guarantees issued and outstanding under this facility

we have various purchase commitments extending through for materials  supplies and services entered into in the ordinary course of business 
included in the purchase commitments table above are contracts which require minimum volume purchases that extend beyond one year or are renewable annually and have been renewed for certain contracts allow for changes in minimum required purchase volumes in the event of a temporary or permanent shutdown of a facility 
to the extent the contract requires a minimum notice period  such notice period has been included in the above table 
the contractual purchase price for substantially all of these contracts is variable based upon market prices  subject to annual negotiations 
we have estimated our contractual obligations by using the terms of our pricing for each contract 
we also have a limited number of contracts which require a minimum payment even if no volume is purchased 
we believe that all of our purchase obligations will be utilized in our normal operations

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are summarized in note summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements 
summarized below are our critical accounting policies fair value pursuant to the texas bank litigation settlement agreement  on june   huntsman international entered into an amendment of its senior credit facilities that provided for term loan c with a million principal amount  and huntsman international also issued million aggregate principal amount of senior notes 
in accordance with accounting guidance regarding fair value measurements  we recorded the term loan c and the senior notes in our accounting records at fair values of million and million  respectively  upon initial recognition in june we primarily used the income approach to determine the fair value of these instruments 
fair value represents the present value of estimated future cash flows calculated using interest rates that were available to us for issuance of debt with similar terms  adjusted for differences in remaining maturity using relevant debt yield curves 
management used judgment with respect to assumptions used in estimating the fair values of the term loan c and the senior notes 
the effect of the following changes in certain key assumptions is summarized as follows dollars in millions assumptions balance sheet impact effective market yield increase decrease estimated increase decrease to june fair values of term loan c and senior notes 
table of contents pursuant to the apollo settlement agreement  on december   we issued million of our convertible notes to apollo affiliates under the note purchase agreement 
in accordance with accounting guidance regarding fair value measurements  we recorded these convertible notes in our accounting records at a fair value of million upon initial recognition in december as previously noted  we repurchased these notes on january  we primarily used the income approach to determine the fair value of the convertible notes 
fair value is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows  calculated using management best estimates of key assumptions including relevant interest rates  expected share volatility  dividend yields  and the probabilities associated with certain features of the convertible notes 
we also used the market approach to assess comparables and corroborate the fair value determined using the income approach 
revenue recognition we generate substantially all of our revenues through sales in the open market and long term supply agreements 
we recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned 
revenue for product sales is recognized when a sales arrangement exists  risk and title to the product transfer to the customer  collectibility is reasonably assured and pricing is fixed or determinable 
the transfer of risk and title to the product to the customer usually occurs at the time shipment is made 
revenue arrangements that contain multiple deliverables  which relate primarily to the licensing of technology  are evaluated in accordance with asc  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements  to determine whether the arrangements should be divided into separate units of accounting and how the arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated among the separate units of accounting 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined using last in first out lifo  first in first out  and average cost methods for different components of inventory 
market is determined based on net realizable value for finished goods inventories and replacement cost for raw materials and work in process inventories 
in periods of declines in the selling prices of our finished products  inventory carrying values may exceed the net realizable value upon sale  resulting in a lower of cost or market charge 
we evaluate the need for a lower of cost or market adjustment to inventories based on the period end selling prices of our finished products 
long lived assets the useful lives of our property  plant and equipment are estimated based upon our historical experience  engineering estimates and industry information and are reviewed when economic events indicate that we may not be able to recover the carrying value of the assets 
the estimated lives of our property range from to years and depreciation is recorded on the straight line method 
inherent in our estimates of useful lives is the assumption that periodic maintenance and an appropriate level of annual capital expenditures will be performed 
without on going capital improvements and maintenance  the productivity and cost efficiency declines and the useful lives of our assets would be shorter 
management uses judgment to estimate the useful lives of our long lived assets 
at december   if the estimated useful lives of our property  plant and equipment had either been one year greater or one year less than their recorded lives  then depreciation expense for would have been approximately million less or million greater  respectively 

table of contents we are required to evaluate the carrying value of our plant assets whenever events indicate that such carrying value may not be recoverable in the future or when management plans change regarding those assets  such as idling or closing a plant 
we evaluate impairment by comparing undiscounted cash flows of the related asset groups that are largely independent of the cash flows of other asset groups to their carrying values 
key assumptions in determining the future cash flows include the useful life  technology  competitive pressures  raw material pricing and regulations 
in connection with our asset evaluation policy  we reviewed all of our long lived assets for indicators that the carrying value may not be recoverable and determined that such indicators did not exist during the year ended december  goodwill we test our goodwill for impairment at least annually at the beginning of the third quarter and when events and circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
goodwill has been assigned to reporting units for purposes of impairment testing 
currently  substantially all of our goodwill balance relates to our advanced materials reporting unit 
fair value is estimated using the market approach  as well as the income approach based on discounted cash flow projections 
the estimated fair values of our reporting units are dependent on several significant assumptions including  among others  market information  operating results  earnings projections and anticipated future cash flows 
we tested goodwill for impairment at the beginning of the third quarter of as part of the annual impairment testing procedures and determined that no goodwill impairment existed 
the results of our annual impairment testing indicated the excess of fair value of our advanced materials reporting unit over its carrying value was approximately  million 
restructuring and plant closing costs we have recorded restructuring charges in recent periods in connection with closing certain plant locations  workforce reductions and other cost savings programs 
these charges are recorded when management has committed to a plan and incurred a liability related to the plan 
also in connection with the textile effects acquisition  we recorded liabilities for workforce reduction  non cancelable lease termination costs and demolition  decommissioning and other restructuring costs 
estimates for plant closing costs include the write off of the carrying value of the plant  any necessary environmental and or regulatory costs  contract termination and demolition costs 
estimates for workforce reductions and other costs savings are recorded based upon estimates of the number of positions to be terminated  termination benefits to be provided and other information  as necessary 
while management evaluates the estimates on a quarterly basis and will adjust the reserve when information indicates that the estimate is above or below the currently recorded estimate  historically management estimates on a project by project basis have not varied to a material degree 
for further discussion of our restructuring activities  see note restructuring  impairment and plant closing costs to our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting purposes 
we evaluate deferred tax assets to determine whether it is more likely than not that they will be realized 
valuation allowances are reviewed each period on a tax jurisdiction by tax jurisdiction basis to analyze whether there is sufficient positive or negative evidence to support a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax 
table of contents assets 
uncertainties regarding expected future income in certain jurisdictions could affect the realization of deferred tax assets in those jurisdictions 
we do not provide for income taxes or benefits on the undistributed earnings of our non us subsidiaries as earnings are reinvested and  in the opinion of management  will continue to be reinvested indefinitely 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the application of income tax law is inherently complex 
we are required to determine if an income tax position meets the criteria of more likely than not to be realized based on the merits of the position under tax law  in order to recognize an income tax benefit 
this requires us to make many assumptions and judgments regarding the merits of income tax positions and the application of income tax law 
additionally  if a tax position meets the recognition criteria of more likely than not we are required to make judgments and assumptions to measure the amount of the tax benefits to recognize based on the probability of the amount of tax benefits that would be realized if the tax position was challenged by the taxing authorities 
interpretations and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time 
as a consequence  changes in assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
employee benefit programs we sponsor several contributory and non contributory defined benefit plans  covering employees primarily in the us  the us  the netherlands  belgium and switzerland  but also covering employees in a number of other countries 
we fund the material plans through trust arrangements or local equivalents where the assets are held separately from us 
we also sponsor unfunded postretirement plans which provide medical and life insurance benefits covering certain employees in the us and canada 
amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements are recorded based upon actuarial valuations performed by various independent actuaries 
inherent in these valuations are numerous assumptions regarding expected return on assets  discount rates  compensation increases  mortality rates and health care costs trends 
these assumptions are disclosed in note employee benefit plans to our consolidated financial statements 
management  with the advice of its actuaries  uses judgment to make assumptions on which our employee pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations and expenses are based 
the effect of a change in three key assumptions is summarized as follows dollars in millions assumptions statement of operations balance sheet impact discount rate increase decrease expected return on assets increase decrease rate of compensation increase increase decrease estimated increase decrease on net periodic benefit cost estimated increase decrease on december  pension and postretirement liabilities and accumulated other comprehensive loss income 
table of contents environmental reserves environmental remediation costs for our facilities are accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
estimates of environmental reserves require evaluating government regulation  available technology  site specific information and remediation alternatives 
we accrue an amount equal to our best estimate of the costs to remediate based upon the available information 
the extent of environmental damage may not be fully known and the processes and costs of remediation may change as new information is obtained or technology for remediation is improved 
our process for estimating the expected cost for remediation considers the information available  technology that can be utilized and estimates of the extent of environmental damage 
adjustments to our estimates are made periodically based upon additional information received as remediation progresses 
for further information  see note environmental  health and safety matters to our consolidated financial statements 
variable interest entities primary beneficiary we evaluate each of our variable interest entities on an on going basis to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary 
management assesses  on an on going basis  the nature of our relationship to the variable interest entity  including the amount of control that we exercise over the entity as well as the amount of risk that we bear and rewards we receive in regards to the entity  to determine if we are the primary beneficiary of that variable interest entity 
management judgment is required to assess whether these attributes are significant 
we consolidate all variable interest entities for which we have concluded that we are the primary beneficiary 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks  such as changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and commodity pricing risks 
from time to time  we enter into transactions  including transactions involving derivative instruments  to manage certain of these exposures 
we also hedge our net investment in certain european operations 
changes in the fair value of the hedge in the net investment of certain european operations are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
interest rate risks through our borrowing activities  we are exposed to interest rate risk 
such risk arises due to the structure of our debt portfolio  including the duration of the portfolio and the mix of fixed and floating interest rates 
actions taken to reduce interest rate risk include managing the mix and rate characteristics of various interest bearing liabilities  as well as entering into interest rate derivative instruments 
from time to time  we may purchase interest rate swaps and or interest rate collars to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on our floating rate long term debt 
under interest rate swaps  we agree with other parties to exchange  at specified intervals  the difference between fixed rate and floating rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed notional principal amount 
the collars entitle us to receive from the counterparties major banks the amounts  if any  by which our interest payments on certain of our floating rate borrowings exceed a certain rate  and require us to pay to the counterparties major banks the amount  if any  by which our interest payments on certain of our floating rate borrowings are less than a certain rate 
on december   we entered into a five year interest rate contract to hedge the variability caused by monthly changes in cash flow due to associated changes in libor under our senior credit facilities 
the notional value of the contract is million  and it has been designated as a cash flow hedge 
the effective portion of the changes in the fair value of the swap was recorded in other comprehensive loss 
we will pay a fixed on the hedge and receive the one month libor rate

in connection with the consolidation of arabian amines company as of july   the interest rate contract is now consolidated by us 
see note variable interest entities to our consolidated financial statements 
the notional amount of the swap as of december  was million  and the interest rate contract is not designated as a cash flow hedge 
as of december   the fair value of the swap was million and was recorded as other noncurrent liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
for  we recorded a reduction in interest expense of million 
for the years ended december  and  the changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss income associated with these cash flow hedging activities was approximately million and million  respectively 
during  accumulated other comprehensive income loss of nil is expected to be reclassified to earnings 
the actual amount that will be reclassified to earnings over the next twelve months may vary from this amount due to changing market conditions 
we would be exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by a counterparty to our derivative financial instruments 
we anticipate  however  that the counterparties will be able to fully satisfy their obligations under the contracts 
market risk arises from changes in interest rates 
foreign exchange rate risk our cash flows and earnings are subject to fluctuations due to exchange rate variation 
our revenues and expenses are denominated in various currencies 
we enter into foreign currency derivative instruments to minimize the short term impact of movements in foreign currency rates 
where practicable  we generally net multicurrency cash balances among our subsidiaries to help reduce exposure to foreign currency exchange rates 
certain other exposures may be managed from time to time through financial market transactions  principally through the purchase of spot or forward foreign exchange contracts generally with maturities of one year or less 
we do not hedge our currency exposures in a manner that would eliminate the effect of changes in exchange rates on our cash flows and earnings 
as of december  and  we had approximately million and million notional amount in us dollar equivalents outstanding  respectively  in foreign currency contracts with a term of approximately one month 
in conjunction with the issuance of our senior subordinated notes due  we entered into cross currency interest rate contracts with three counterparties 
on march   we made payments of million to these counterparties and received million from these counterparties  and on maturity march  we are required to pay million to these counterparties and will receive million from these counterparties 
on march and september of each year  we will receive us dollar interest payments of approximately million equivalent to an annual rate of and make interest payments of approximately million equivalent to an annual rate of approximately 
this swap is designated as a hedge of net investment for financial reporting 
table of contents purposes 
as of december   the fair value of this swap was million and was recorded as noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheet 
for  the effective portion of the changes in the fair value of million was recorded in other comprehensive income  with the ineffective portion of million  recorded as an addition reduction to interest expense 
on july   we changed the method of assessing the effectiveness of this hedge from the spot method to the forward method  which we believe will reduce the ineffective portion and lower volatility in interest expense in future periods 
in  we unwound a cross currency interest rate swap pursuant to which we had swapped million of libor floating rate debt payments for million of euribor floating rate debt payments 
this swap was not designated as a hedge for financial reporting purposes 
for the year ended december   we recorded a foreign currency gain on this swap of million in the consolidated statements of operations 
also in  we unwound a cross currency interest rate swap pursuant to which we had swapped million of libor floating rate debt payments for million of euribor floating rate debt payments 
this swap was designated as a hedge of a net investment for financial reporting purposes 
we received a cash benefit from the unwind of million in the fourth quarter of for the year ended december   the effective portion of the changes in the fair value of million was recorded as income in other comprehensive loss income  with ineffectiveness of million recorded in interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
a significant portion of our debt is denominated in euros 
we also finance certain of our non us subsidiaries with intercompany loans that are  in many cases  denominated in currencies other than the entities functional currency 
we manage the net foreign currency exposure created by this debt through various means  including cross currency swaps  the designation of certain intercompany loans as permanent loans because they are not expected to be repaid in the foreseeable future permanent loans and the designation of certain debt and swaps as net investment hedges 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses on intercompany loans that are not designated as permanent loans are recorded in earnings 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses on intercompany loans that are designated as permanent loans are recorded in other comprehensive income 
from time to time  we review such designation of intercompany loans 
we review our non us dollar denominated debt to determine the appropriate amounts designated as hedges 
as of december   we have designated approximately million approximately million of euro denominated debt as a hedge of our net investment 
for the years ended december   and  the amount of loss gain recognized on the hedge of our net investment was million  million and million  respectively  and was recorded in other comprehensive income loss 
as of december   we had approximately million approximately  million in net euro assets 
commodity prices risk our exposure to changing commodity prices is somewhat limited since the majority of our raw materials are acquired at posted or market related prices  and sales prices for many of our finished products are at market related prices which are largely set on a monthly or quarterly basis in line with industry practice 
consequently  we do not generally hedge our commodity exposures
