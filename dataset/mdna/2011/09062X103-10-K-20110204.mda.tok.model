item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes beginning on page f of this report 
executive summary introduction biogen idec is a global biotechnology company focused on discovering  developing  manufacturing and marketing products for the treatment of neurological disorders and other serious diseases 
we have four marketed products avonex  tysabri  rituxan and fumaderm 
patients worldwide benefit from our significant products used for the treatment of multiple sclerosis ms  non hodgkin s lymphoma nhl  rheumatoid arthritis ra  crohn s disease  chronic lymphocytic leukemia cll and psoriasis 
in the near term  our current and future revenues are dependent upon continued sales of our three principal products  avonex  rituxan and tysabri 
in the longer term  our revenue growth will be dependent upon the successful pursuit of external business development opportunities and clinical development  regulatory approval and launch of new commercial products as well as upon our ability to protect our patents related to our marketed products and assets originating from our research and development efforts 
as part of our ongoing research and development efforts  we have devoted significant resources to conducting clinical studies to advance the development of new pharmaceutical products and to explore the utility of our existing products in treating disorders beyond those currently approved in their labels 
on november   we announced a number of strategic  operational and organizational initiatives  which are described below under the heading restructuring charges 
we expect to incur charges totaling approximately million associated with the implementation of these initiatives  which are anticipated to be substantially completed by the end of financial highlights the following table is a summary of financial results achieved for the years ended change december  compared in millions  except per share amounts and percentages to total revenues income from operations net income attributable to biogen idec inc diluted earnings per share attributable to biogen idec inc income from operations for was reduced by approximately million related to the achievement of a milestone by biogen idec hemophilia  inc formerly syntonix pharmaceuticals  inc 
and a million charge incurred in connection with the collaboration and license agreement entered into with knopp neurosciences inc knopp  which we consolidated as we determined that we were the primary beneficiary of this relationship 
the million was partially offset by an attribution of million to the noncontrolling interest 
net income attributable to noncontrolling interest also includes a charge of million related to the payment made in to cardiokine biopharma llc cardiokine pursuant to the termination of our lixivaptan collaboration 
income from operations  as well as net income attributable to biogen idec inc for  were reduced by the million restructuring charge recognized during the fourth quarter of income from operations for was reduced by the million upfront payment made to acorda therapeutics  inc related to our collaboration and license agreement dated june  as described below under results of operations  our operating results for the year ended december   reflect the following worldwide avonex revenues totaled  million for  representing an increase of over 
table of contents our share of tysabri revenues totaled million for  representing an increase of over our share of rituxan revenues totaled  million for  representing a decrease of from this decrease was primarily driven by royalty expirations in our rest of world markets 
our share of revenue on sales of rituxan in the rest of world decreased or million from our share of co promotion profits in the us increased or million over selling and development expenses incurred by us and reimbursed by genentech  which are also included within our total unconsolidated joint business revenues  decreased to million from the prior year comparative period 
total cost and expenses increased for  compared to this increase was primarily driven by the million ipr d charge and the million restructuring charges recognized in as well as a increase in selling  general and administrative costs and a increase in collaboration profit sharing expense due to tysabri revenue growth  offset by a decrease in amortization of acquired intangible assets 
in addition  we generated  million of net cash flows from operations for  which were primarily driven by earnings 
cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately  million as of december  in  we repurchased approximately million shares at a cost of approximately billion under our and share repurchase authorizations 
we retired all of these shares as they were acquired 
our and share repurchase programs were completed during the third and first quarters of  respectively 
business development highlights in december  we completed our acquisition of panima pharmaceuticals ag panima  an affiliate of neurimmune ag 
the purchase price is comprised of a million cash payment  plus contingent consideration in the form of development milestones of up to million in cash 
panima is involved in the discovery of antibodies designed to treat neurological disorders 
for a more detailed description of this transaction  please read note  acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
in october  we amended our collaboration agreement with genentech with regard to the development of ocrelizumab and agreed to terms for the development of ga under the terms of the amended agreement  genentech is responsible for the further development and commercialization of ocrelizumab and funding future costs 
we will receive tiered royalties between and on us sales of ocrelizumab 
commercialization of ocrelizumab will not impact our percentage of the co promotion profits for rituxan 
in addition  we will pay of the development and commercialization expenses of ga and will receive between and of the profits of ga based upon the achievement of certain sales milestones 
commercialization of ga will impact our percentage of the co promotion profits for rituxan 
this amendment did not have an impact on our share of the co promotion operating profits of rituxan in for a more detailed description of this collaboration  please read note  collaborations to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
in august  we entered into a license agreement with knopp neurosciences  inc knopp  for the development  manufacture and commercialization of dexpramipexole  an orally administered small molecule in clinical development for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als 
under the terms of the license agreement we made a million upfront payment and agreed to pay knopp up to an additional million in development and sales based milestone payments  as well as royalties on future commercial sales

business environment we conduct our business primarily within the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries  which are highly competitive 
many of our competitors are working to develop products similar to those we are developing or already market 
we may also face increased competitive pressures as a result of the emergence of biosimilars 
in the us  avonex  rituxan and tysabri are licensed under the public health service act phsa as biological 
table of contents products 
in march  us healthcare reform legislation amended the phsa to authorize the fda to approve biological products  known as biosimilars or follow on biologics  that are shown to be highly similar to previously approved biological products based upon potentially abbreviated data packages 
in addition  the recently enacted us healthcare reform legislation contained additional provisions  including cost containment measures 
we have encountered similar efforts to reform health care coverage and costs in other countries in which we operate 
moreover  the economic environment in europe has become increasingly challenging 
many of the countries in which we operate are also seeking to reduce their public expenditures in light of the recent global economic downturn 
the deterioration of the credit and economic conditions in certain countries in europe has delayed reimbursement for our products and led to additional austerity measures aimed at reducing healthcare costs 
global efforts to reduce healthcare costs continue to exert pressure on product pricing and have negatively impacted our revenues and results of operations 
for additional information about certain risks that could negatively impact our financial position or future results of operations  please read the risk factors section of this report

decreased commercial demand resulted in declines of approximately and in us avonex unit sales volume for and  respectively  from the prior year comparative periods 
our us avonex revenue was also negatively impacted by reserves established for rebates and allowances related to the newly enacted healthcare reform legislation in the us in addition  we continued to experience higher participation in our access program  which provides free product to eligible patients for both the and comparative periods 
for compared to  the increase in rest of world avonex revenue was due to increased commercial demand offset by price decreases in some countries and the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates resulting from the relative strengthening of the us dollar against relevant foreign currencies  primarily the euro 
for compared to  the decrease in rest of world avonex revenue was primarily due to the negative impact of foreign exchange rate changes  offset by increased commercial demand and price increases in some countries 
increased commercial demand resulted in increases of approximately in rest of world avonex sales volume for and in both periods 
avonex rest of world revenues for also include gains recognized in relation to the settlement of certain cash flow hedge instruments under our foreign currency hedging program totaling million  compared to losses recognized of million and million for and  respectively 
we expect avonex to face increasing competition in the ms marketplace in both the us and rest of world 
a number of companies  including us  are working to develop products to treat ms that may compete with avonex now and in the future  including oral and other alternative formulations 
in addition  the continued growth of tysabri and the commercialization of our other pipeline product candidates may negatively impact future sales of avonex 
increased competition may lead to reduced unit sales of avonex  as well as increasing price pressure 
tysabri we collaborate with elan pharma international  ltd elan an affiliate of elan corporation  plc  on the development and commercialization of tysabri 
for a more detailed description of this collaboration  please read note  collaborations to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
revenues from tysabri are summarized as follows change for the years ended december  compared compared in millions  except percentages to to united states rest of world total tysabri revenues for compared to  as well as for compared to  the increase in us tysabri revenue was due to increased commercial demand 
increased commercial demand resulted in increases of approximately 
table of contents and in us tysabri unit sales volume for and  respectively  over the prior year comparative periods 
for compared to  the increase was also due to price increases 
this increase was offset by the impact of the sale of previously written down tysabri inventory  which became saleable following the approval of our higher yielding manufacturing process 
as our sales price to elan in the us is set to effect an approximate equal sharing of the gross margin with elan plus reimbursement for our cost of goods sold  the distribution of this specific inventory reduced our cost of sales  which reduced the price per unit we charged to elan and reduced our revenues by million compared to this inventory was fully utilized during net sales of tysabri from our collaboration partner  elan  to third party customers in the us for  and totaled million  million and million  respectively 
for compared to  as well as for compared to  the increase in rest of world tysabri revenue was due to increased commercial demand of tysabri in our rest of world markets offset by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates resulting from the relative strengthening of the us dollar against relevant foreign currencies  primarily the euro 
for compared to  the increase in rest of world tysabri revenue was partially offset by price decreases in some countries 
increased commercial demand resulted in increases of and in rest of world tysabri sales volume for and  respectively  over the prior year comparative periods 
tysabri rest of world revenues for also include gains recognized in relation to the settlement of certain cash flow hedge instruments under our foreign currency hedging program totaling million  compared to losses recognized of million for no such losses were recognized in as we did not designate hedges against tysabri rest of world revenues in that period 
the prescribing information for tysabri contains significant safety warnings  including tysabri increases the risk of developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy pml  a serious brain infection 
the risk of pml is increased in patients who have been treated with an immunosuppressant prior to receiving tysabri 
the risk of developing pml increases with longer treatment duration  with limited experience beyond three years 
immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome iris may occur in patients who developed pml and subsequently discontinued tysabri 
these safety warnings  and any future safety related label changes  may limit the growth of tysabri unit sales 
we continue to research and develop protocols and therapies that may reduce risk and improve outcomes of pml in patients 
for example  our efforts have included working to identify patient or viral characteristics which contribute to the risk of developing pml  including the presence of asymptomatic jc virus infection with an assay to detect an immune response against the jc virus 
we have initiated two clinical studies in the us  known as stratify and stratify  that collectively  are intended to define the prevalence of serum jc virus antibody in patients with relapsing ms receiving or considering treatment with tysabri and to evaluate the potential to stratify patients into lower or higher risk for developing pml based on antibody status 
our efforts to stratify patients into lower or higher risk for developing pml  and other ongoing or future clinical trials involving tysabri may have a negative impact on prescribing behavior in at least the short term which may result in decreased product revenues from sales of tysabri 
we also expect tysabri to face increasing competition in the ms marketplace in both the us and rest of world 
a number of companies  including us  are working to develop products to treat ms that may compete with tysabri now and in the future  including oral and other alternative formulations 
in addition  the commercialization of our other pipeline product candidates may negatively impact future sales of tysabri 
increased competition may also lead to reduced unit sales of tysabri  as well as increasing price pressure 
we have initiated the five year renewal process for tysabri s marketing authorization in the eu this marketing authorization review by eu regulators  in addition to ongoing label discussions with us regulators  
table of contents includes assessment of the criteria for confirming pml diagnosis  the number of pml cases  the incidence of pml in tysabri patients  the risk factors for pml  as well as an overall assessment of tysabri s benefit risk profile 
our interactions with eu and eu regulators could result in modifications to the respective labels or other restrictions for tysabri 
upon completion of the assessment of the tysabri renewal in the eu the marketing authorization is expected to be valid for either an unlimited period or for an additional five year term 
other product revenues other product revenues primarily consist of revenues derived from sales of fumaderm and are summarized as follows change for the years ended december  compared compared in millions  except percentages to to fumaderm other total other product revenues unconsolidated joint business revenues we collaborate with genentech on the development and commercialization of rituxan 
on october   we and genentech amended and restated our amended and restated collaboration agreement dated june  with regard to the development of ocrelizumab  a humanized anti cd antibody  and agreed to terms for the development of ga  a next generation anti cd antibody 
this amendment did not have an impact on our share of the co promotion operating profits recognized for rituxan in for a more detailed description of this collaboration and additional information regarding the pretax co promotion profit sharing formula for rituxan and its impact on future unconsolidated joint business revenues  please read note  collaborations to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
in the fourth quarter of  as part of our recent restructuring initiative  which is described below under the heading restructuring charge  we reached an agreement with genentech to eliminate our rituxan oncology and rheumatology sales force  with genentech assuming the sole responsibility for the us sales and marketing efforts related to rituxan 
we believe that centralizing the sales force will enhance the sales effectiveness and profitability of our collaboration for the sale of rituxan in the us as a result of this change  we expect that the amount of reimbursement for selling and development expense in the us to decrease in future periods to a negligible amount 
for   and  we were reimbursed million  million and million  respectively  primarily for sales and marketing activities performed in support of rituxan 
revenues from unconsolidated joint business are summarized as follows change for the years ended december  compared compared in millions  except percentages to to biogen idec s share of co promotion profits in the us reimbursement of selling and development expenses in the us revenue on sales of rituxan in the rest of world total unconsolidated joint business revenues 
table of contents biogen idec s share of co promotion profits in the us the following table provides a summary of amounts comprising our share of co promotion profits in the us change for the years ended december  compared compared in millions  except percentages to to product revenues  net costs and expenses co promotion profits in the us biogen idec s share of co promotion profits in the us for compared to  as well as for compared to  the increase in us rituxan product revenues was primarily due to price increases and an increase in commercial demand  which resulted in an increase in unit sales volume of approximately 
for compared to  the increase in us rituxan product revenue was primarily due to price increases offset by a decrease in commercial demand of approximately 
for compared to  as well as for compared to  the decrease in collaboration costs and expenses primarily resulted from a decline in expenditures for the development of rituxan for use in other indications 
as described below under the heading provision for discounts and allowances healthcare reform  beginning in  a new fee will be payable by all prescription drug manufacturers and importers 
we estimate that the fee assessed genentech on qualifying sales of rituxan will result in a reduction of our share of pre tax co promotion profits in the us of approximately million in under our collaboration agreement  our current pretax co promotion profit sharing formula  which resets annually  provides for a share of co promotion profits if co promotion operating profits exceed million 
for  and  the threshold was met during the first quarter 
reimbursement of selling and development expense in the us as discussed in note  collaborations to our consolidated financial statements included in this report  genentech incurs the majority of continuing development costs for rituxan 
expenses incurred by genentech in the development of rituxan are not recorded as research and development expense  but rather reduce our share of co promotion profits recorded as a component of unconsolidated joint business revenue 
for compared to  the decrease in selling and development expenses incurred by us in the us and reimbursed by genentech was primarily the result of the elimination of our rituxan oncology and rheumatology sales force in the fourth quarter for compared to  the increase in selling and development expenses incurred by us in the us and reimbursed by genentech was primarily the result of our increased sales and marketing activities in support of rituxan 
revenue on sales of rituxan in the rest of world revenue on sales of rituxan in the rest of world consists of our share of pretax co promotion profits in canada and royalty revenue on sales of rituxan outside the us and canada 
for compared to  as well as for compared to  revenues on sales of rituxan in the rest of world continue to decline due to royalty expirations in certain of our rest of world markets 
the royalty period for sales in the rest of world with respect to all products is years from the first commercial sale of such product on a country by country basis 
specifically  the royalty periods with respect to sales in france  spain  germany and the united kingdom expired in the royalty period with respect to sales in italy expired in the royalty periods for substantially all of the remaining royalty bearing sales of rituxan in the rest of the world will expire through as a result of these expirations  we expect royalty revenues derived from sales of rituxan in the rest of world to continue to decline in future periods 
the decreases experienced during were offset by a payment from genentech totaling million representing a cumulative underpayment of royalties owed to us on sales of rituxan in the rest of world 

table of contents other revenues other revenues are summarized as follows change for the years ended december  compared compared in millions  except percentages to to royalty revenues corporate partner revenues total other revenues royalty revenues we receive royalties on sales by our licensees of products covered under patents that we own 
sales of licensed products could vary significantly due to competition  manufacturing difficulties and other factors that are not within our control 
in addition  the expiration or invalidation of any underlying patents could reduce or eliminate the royalty revenues derived from such patents 
for compared to  as well as for compared to  the increase in royalty revenues was primarily driven by increased sales of angiomax bivalirudin licensed to the medicines company tmc 
the increase for compared to was offset by a decline in royalties from sales of other licensed products and the expiration of certain contracts and license agreements 
our most significant source of royalty revenue is derived from sales of angiomax by tmc 
tmc sells angiomax in the us  europe  canada  central america  south america  israel and australia 
royalty revenues related to the sales of angiomax are recognized in an amount equal to the level of net sales achieved during a calendar year multiplied by the royalty rate in effect for that tier under our agreement with tmc 
the royalty rate increases based upon which tier of total net sales are earned in any calendar year 
the increased royalty rate is applied retroactively to the first dollar of net sales achieved during the year 
this formula has the effect of increasing the amount of royalty revenue to be recognized in later quarters and  as a result  an adjustment is recorded in the period in which an increase in royalty rate has been achieved 
under the terms of our agreement  tmc is obligated to pay us royalties earned  on a country by country basis  until the later of twelve years from the date of the first commercial sale of angiomax in such country or the date upon which the product is no longer covered by a patent in such country 
the annual royalty rate is reduced by a specified percentage in any country where the product is no longer covered by a patent and where sales have been reduced to a certain volume based market share 
tmc began selling angiomax in the us in january the principal us patent that covers angiomax was due to expire in march and tmc applied for an extension of the term of this patent 
initially  the us patent and trademark office pto rejected tmc s application because in its view the application was not timely filed 
tmc sued the pto in federal district court seeking to extend the term of the principal us patent to december on august   the federal district court ordered the pto to deem the application as timely filed 
the pto did not appeal the order  but a generic manufacturer is seeking the right to intervene and file an appeal 
the pto has granted an interim extension of the patent term until august  in the event that tmc is unsuccessful in obtaining a patent term extension thereafter and third parties sell products comparable to angiomax  we would expect a significant decrease in royalty revenues due to increased competition  which may impact sales and result in lower royalty tiered rates 
corporate partner revenues we have also sold or exclusively licensed to third parties rights to certain products previously included within our product line 
royalty or supply agreement revenues received based upon those products are recorded as corporate partner revenue 
amounts recorded as corporate partner revenue also include amounts earned upon delivery of product under contract manufacturing agreements 
for compared to  the increase in corporate partner revenues was primarily due to amounts earned under the terms of our contract manufacturing agreement with astellas pharma us  inc for the supply of 
table of contents amevive 
for compared to  the decrease in corporate partner revenues was primarily due to milestone and royalty payments received in totaling million related to zevalin 
provisions for discounts and allowances revenues from product sales are recorded net of applicable allowances for trade term discounts  wholesaler incentives  medicaid rebates  veterans administration va and public health service phs discounts  managed care rebates  product returns  and other applicable allowances 
reserves established for these discounts and allowances are classified as reductions of accounts receivable if the amount is payable to our customer or a liability if the amount is payable to a party other than our customer 
reserves for discounts  contractual adjustments and returns that reduced gross product revenues are summarized as follows change for the years ended december  compared compared in millions  except percentages to to discounts contractual adjustments returns total allowances gross product revenues percent of gross product revenues discount reserves include trade term discounts and wholesaler incentives 
for compared to  as well as for compared to  the increase in discounts was primarily driven by increases in trade term discounts and wholesaler incentives as a result of price increases and increased sales 
contractual adjustment reserves relate to medicaid and managed care rebates  va and phs discounts and other applicable allowances 
for compared to  as well as for compared to  the increase in contractual adjustments was due to the impact of higher reserves for managed care and medicaid and va programs primarily associated with price increases in the us for compared to  the increase in contractual adjustments was also due to the impact of higher contractual rebates and discounts resulting from us healthcare reform legislation passed in march  as further discussed below 
product return reserves are established for returns made by wholesalers 
in accordance with contractual terms  wholesalers are permitted to return product for reasons such as damaged or expired product 
the majority of wholesaler returns are due to product expiration 
we also accept returns from our patients for various reasons 
reserves for product returns are recorded in the period the related revenue is recognized  resulting in a reduction to product sales 
for compared to  as well as for compared to  return reserves remained relatively unchanged 
healthcare reform in  healthcare reform legislation was enacted in the us this legislation contains several provisions that affect our business 
although many provisions of the new legislation do not take effect immediately  several provisions became effective in these include an increase in the minimum medicaid rebate to states participating in the medicaid program from to on our branded prescription drugs  the extension of the medicaid rebate to managed care organizations that dispense drugs to medicaid beneficiaries  and the expansion of the b phs drug pricing program  which provides outpatient drugs at reduced rates  to include additional hospitals  clinics  and healthcare centers 
beginning in  the new law also requires drug manufacturers to provide a discount to medicare beneficiaries whose prescription drug costs cause them to be subject to the medicare part d coverage gap ie  the donut hole 
also  in  a new fee will be payable by all branded prescription drug manufacturers and importers 
this fee will be calculated based upon each organization s percentage share of total branded prescription 
table of contents drug sales to qualifying us government programs such as medicare  medicaid and va and phs discount programs 
as defined by the act  branded prescription drug sales exclude the sales of any drug or biologic for which an orphan drug tax credit was allowed and was not subsequently approved for a non orphan indication 
as avonex has no other labeled indications  other than that for which it received its orphan designation  we believe that avonex sales are considered exempt from the fee 
we estimate that the fee assessed to genentech on qualifying sales of rituxan will result in a reduction of our share of pre tax co promotion profits in the us of approximately million in we will reflect our share of the fee assessed to elan on qualifying sales of tysabri as selling  general and administrative expense  which we do not expect to be significant based on expected sales for qualifying us government programs 
this new legislation contains a number of provisions that affect existing government programs and has required the creation of new programs  policies and processes  many of which remain under development and have not been fully implemented 
for example  we do not yet fully know the extent of additional entities eligible to participate under the b program or when and how discounts will be provided to these entities 
in addition  in november  the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms amended and then withdrew current regulations governing calculation of average manufacture price  however  no replacement regulations have been proposed 
accordingly  our discounts and allowances are based on several assumptions about the implementation of this legislation 
actual results may differ from our estimates 
in addition  we anticipate that many countries outside the us will continue to implement austerity measures including efforts aimed at reducing healthcare costs as these countries attempt to manage increasing healthcare expenditures  especially in light of the global economic downturn and the deterioration of the credit and economic conditions in certain countries in europe 
for example  certain governments of countries in which we operate have already implemented or may implement measures to reduce or control healthcare costs that  among other things  include imposed price reductions  suspensions on pricing increases on pharmaceuticals  increased mandatory discounts and rebates or seek recoveries of past price increases 
certain measures already implemented have negatively impacted our revenues 
our revenues and results of operations will be further negatively impacted if these  similar or more extensive measures continue to be implemented 
cost and expenses a summary of total cost and expenses is as follows change for the years ended december  compared compared in millions  except percentages to to cost of sales  excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets research and development selling  general and administrative collaboration profit sharing amortization of acquired intangible assets restructuring charge acquired in process research and development gain on dispositions  net total cost and expenses 
table of contents cost of sales  excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets cost of sales change for the years ended december  compared compared in millions  except percentages to to cost of sales  excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets for compared to  the increase in cost of sales was primarily due to higher unit sales volume 
the increase for the comparative period was also driven by a million increase in costs associated with contract manufacturing activity for the supply of amevive as well as million of period expense incurred related to the shutdown for capital upgrades of our manufacturing facility in research triangle park  north carolina 
this comparative increase was offset by the sale of previously written down tysabri inventory  which became saleable following approval of our new higher yielding manufacturing process 
the distribution of this inventory  which was fully utilized during  reduced our cost of sales by million compared to in addition  the sale of inventory produced under our new high titer production process reduced our cost of sales by million compared to for compared to  the decrease in cost of sales was primarily due to a million decrease in write downs from unmarketable inventory  a million decrease in production costs due to the implementation of a new high titer production process which produces higher yields of tysabri and an million decrease in royalty payments on sales of licensed product due mainly to the expiration of certain contracts and license agreements 
these decreases were offset by a million increase in costs associated with higher tysabri unit sales volume 
in addition  during we also incurred a million period expense related to the shutdown of our manufacturing facility in research triangle park  north carolina for the implementation of the high titer production process upgrades 
we expect an increase in total cost of sales for  as a result of an increase in expected contract manufacturing activity and increased production costs 
write downs from unmarketable inventory our products are subject to strict quality control and monitoring which we perform throughout the manufacturing process 
periodically  certain batches or units of product may no longer meet quality specifications or may expire 
the expiry associated with our inventory is generally between months and years  depending on the product 
obsolescence due to expiration has historically been insignificant 
amounts written down related to unmarketable inventory are charged to cost of sales  and totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
research and development change for the years ended december  compared compared in millions  except percentages to to research and development for compared to  research and development expense decreased by million 
our research and development spend in included a million upfront payment made to knopp under a license agreement  increased clinical activity for our daclizumab  pegylated interferon beta a  neublastin  factor viii and factor ix programs  and efforts to research and develop protocols that may reduce risk and improve outcomes of pml in patients treated with tysabri 
in addition  our costs for the factor viii and factor ix programs increased in following the restructuring of our collaboration agreement with swedish orphan biovitrum  whereby we assumed full development and manufacturing responsibilities for these programs 
these increases were offset by a reduction in spending in certain deprioritized programs 

table of contents for compared to  research and development expenses increased by million  driven primarily by the million upfront payment made to acorda  as well as a net increase of million related to the ramp up of clinical trial activity for certain development stage product candidates including lixivaptan  bg  humanized anti cd and adentri 
in addition  in  we also initiated registrational trials in our pegylated interferon program 
the aforementioned increases were offset by a reduction of spending across several programs including baminercept in ra  lumiliximab and volociximab 
as part of our recent restructuring initiative  which is described below under the heading restructuring charge  we are in the process of reducing our overall headcount by approximately and have terminated or are in the process of discontinuing certain research and development programs  including substantially all of our cardiovascular and oncology programs and select programs in neurology and immunology 
our workforce reduction efforts impact all sales  research and development and administrative functions 
we expect total research and development expense in to be between and of total revenue 
milestone and upfront payments milestone and upfront payments to our collaboration partners  included within research and development expense  totaled million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the change for each of the comparative periods was primarily the result of the million upfront payment made to acorda in the timing of future upfront fees and milestone payments may cause variability in future research and development expense 
selling  general and administrative change for the years ended december  compared compared in millions  except percentages to to selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses are primarily comprised of compensation and benefits associated with sales and marketing  finance  legal and other administrative personnel  outside marketing and legal expenses and other general and administrative costs 
for compared to  selling  general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to increased sales and marketing activities in support of avonex and tysabri and increased grant and sponsorship activity 
the increase for the comparative periods also includes an incremental charge of approximately million recognized in related to the modification of equity based compensation in accordance with the transition agreement entered into with james c 
mullen  who retired as our president and chief executive officer on june  for compared to  the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily driven by the positive impact of foreign currency exchange rates and a reduction of expenses reimbursed to elan for their marketing of tysabri for crohn s disease in the us these decreases were offset by costs incurred associated with our geographic expansion into new markets 
as part of our recent restructuring initiative  which is described below under the heading restructuring charge  we are in the process of reducing our overall headcount by approximately 
this workforce reduction impacts all sales  research and development and administrative functions 
we expect total selling  general and administrative expense in to be between and of total revenue 

table of contents collaboration profit sharing change for the years ended december  compared compared in millions  except percentages to to collaboration profit sharing for compared to  as well as for compared to  the increases in collaboration profit sharing expense were due to the continued increase in tysabri rest of world sales resulting in higher rest of world net operating profits to be shared with elan and resulting in growth in the third party royalties elan paid on behalf of the collaboration 
for  and  our collaboration profit sharing expense included million  million and million related to the reimbursement of third party royalty payments made by elan 
for a more detailed description of this collaboration  please read note  collaborations to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
amortization of acquired intangible assets change for the years ended december  compared compared in millions  except percentages to to amortization of acquired intangible assets our most significant intangible asset is the core technology related to our avonex product 
our amortization policy reflects our belief that the economic benefit of our core technology is consumed as revenue is generated from our avonex product 
we refer to this amortization methodology as the economic consumption model  which involves calculating a ratio of actual current period sales to total anticipated sales for the life of the product and applying this ratio to the carrying amount of the intangible asset 
an analysis of the anticipated lifetime revenue of avonex is performed at least annually during our long range planning cycle  and this analysis serves as the basis for the calculation of our economic consumption amortization model 
although we believe this process has allowed us to reliably determine the best estimate of the pattern in which we will consume the economic benefits of our core technology intangible asset  the model could result in deferring amortization charges to future periods in certain instances  due to continued sales of the product at a nominal level after patent expiration or otherwise 
in order to ensure that amortization charges are not unreasonably deferred to future periods  we compare the amount of amortization determined under the economic consumption model against the minimum amount of amortization recalculated each year under the straight line method and record the higher amount 
we completed our most recent long range planning cycle in the third quarter of this analysis is based upon certain assumptions that we evaluate on a periodic basis  such as the anticipated product sales of avonex and expected impact of competitor products and our own pipeline product candidates  as well as the issuance of new patents or the extension of existing patents 
based upon this analysis  we have continued to amortize this asset on the economic consumption model for the third and fourth quarters of  and expect to apply the same model for the next two quarters 
in addition  since we do not currently expect a significant change in the expected lifetime revenue of avonex  amortization expected to be recorded in relation to our core intangible asset for the first two quarters of is anticipated to be comparable to the amounts recorded during the third and fourth quarters of amortization of our core intangible asset related to avonex totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
for compared to  amortization recorded for the third and fourth quarters of decreased significantly from their respective prior year comparative periods 
this decrease was driven by the issuance of the avonex patent in september the issuance of this patent  expiring in september  resulted in an increase in the total expected lifetime revenue of avonex and an extension of the assumed remaining life of our core intangible asset 
based upon our most recent analysis  amortization for acquired intangible assets is expected to be in the range of approximately million to million annually through 
table of contents we monitor events and expectations on product performance 
if there are any indications that the assumptions underlying our most recent analysis would be different than those utilized within our current estimates  our analysis would be updated and may result in a significant change in the anticipated lifetime revenue of avonex determined during our most recent annual review 
for example  the occurrence of an adverse event  such as the invalidation of our avonex patent issued in september  could substantially increase the amount of amortization expense associated with our acquired intangible assets as compared to previous periods or our current expectations  which may result in a significant negative impact on our future results of operations 
restructuring charge change for the years ended december  compared compared in millions  except percentages to to restructuring charge on november   we announced a number of strategic  operational and organizational initiatives designed to provide a framework for the future growth of our business  which are summarized as follows we intend to focus our business on neurology and leverage our strengths in biologics research  development and manufacturing to pursue select biological therapies where there is a significant unmet need and where the drug candidate has the potential to be highly differentiated 
accordingly  during the fourth quarter of  we began to reallocate resources within our research and development organization to maximize our investment in our highest potential programs 
as a result  we have terminated or are in the process of discontinuing certain research and development programs  including substantially all of our oncology programs which we are looking to spin out or out license  our cardiovascular programs and select neurology and immunology programs 
in addition  we have substantially reduced our small molecule discovery activities in favor of outsourcing these efforts 
we are in the process of vacating the san diego  california facility and consolidating our massachusetts facilities 
we eliminated our rituxan oncology and rheumatology sales force and genentech  inc  a wholly owned member of the roche group  has assumed sole responsibility for the us sales and marketing efforts related to rituxan 
we are in the process of completing a reduction in our workforce and realigning our overall structure to become a more efficient and cost effective organization 
the workforce reduction spans our sales  research and development and administrative functions 
as a result of these initiatives  we expect to realize annual savings of approximately million 
the substantial majority of the savings will be realized within research and development and selling  general and administrative expense and are expected to be fully realized beginning in the latter half of these expected savings may be offset to some degree by costs associated with initiatives to grow our business 
we expect to incur total restructuring charges of approximately million  comprised of million for workforce reduction and million for facility consolidation 
we recognized million of these charges within our consolidated statement of income during  which are summarized as follows for the year ended in millions december  workforce reduction facility consolidation total restructuring charges 
table of contents we expect that our restructuring efforts will be substantially completed  and that substantially all of the remaining restructuring charges will be incurred by the end of costs associated with our workforce reduction primarily relate to employee severance and benefits 
facility consolidation costs are primarily comprised of charges associated with the closing of facilities  related lease obligations and additional depreciation recognized when the expected useful lives of certain assets have been shortened due to the consolidation and closing of related facilities and the discontinuation of certain research and development programs 
the following table summarizes the charges and spending related to our restructuring efforts during workforce facility in millions reduction consolidation total reserves established amounts paid additional depreciation and other non cash charges restructuring reserves at december  we expect that substantially all remaining payments will be made  by the end of acquired in process research and development ipr d change for the years ended december  compared compared in millions  except percentages to to acquired in process research and development in august  we entered into a license agreement with knopp for the development  manufacture and commercialization of dexpramipexole  an orally administered small molecule in clinical development for the treatment of als 
as we determined that we are the primary beneficiary of knopp  we consolidate the results of knopp and recorded an ipr d charge of approximately million upon initial consolidation 
we have attributed approximately million of the total ipr d charge to the noncontrolling interest  representing the noncontrolling interest s ownership interest in the equity of knopp

in connection with our acquisition of biogen idec hemophilia inc  formerly syntonix pharmaceuticals  inc syntonix  in january  we agreed to make additional future consideration payments based upon the achievement of certain milestone events 
one of these milestones was achieved when  in january  we initiated patient enrollment in a registrational trial of factor ix in hemophilia b 
as a result of the achievement of this we paid approximately million to the former shareholders of syntonix

capitalized interest costs are primarily related to the development of our large scale biologic manufacturing facility in hiller d  denmark 
we plan to stop further validation on this facility following completion of facility s operational qualification activities in the first half of as we continue to evaluate our current manufacturing utilization strategy 
recent manufacturing improvements have resulted in favorable production yields on tysabri  that along with slower than expected tysabri growth  have reduced our expected capacity requirements 
as a result  we have decided to delay the start of manufacturing activities at this site until additional capacity is required by the business 
accordingly  we expect to cease capitalizing interest in relation to this project at that time 
impairment on investments in  we recognized million in charges for the other than temporary impairment of our publicly held strategic investments  investments in venture capital funds and investments in privately held companies 
the increase over amounts recognized in was primarily the result of aveo pharmaceuticals  inc  one of our strategic investments  executing an equity offering at a price below our cost basis during the first quarter of in  we recognized impairment losses of million on our publicly held strategic investments and non marketable securities and an additional million in charges for the other than temporary impairment on our marketable debt securities primarily related to mortgage and asset backed securities

we may incur additional impairment charges on these investments in the future 
income tax provision change for the years ended december  compared compared in millions  except percentages to to effective tax rate on pre tax income income tax expense our effective tax rate fluctuates from year to year due to the nature of our global operations 
the factors that most significantly impact our effective tax rate include variability in the allocation of our taxable earnings between multiple jurisdictions  changes in tax laws  acquisitions and licensing transactions 
for compared to  our effective tax rate was negatively impacted due to the attribution to noncontrolling interest of million of the ipr d charge related to our license agreement with knopp neurosciences  inc as such  the attributed amount will not generate a tax deduction  causing our tax rate to be unfavorably impacted by 
the impact of the knopp transaction was partially offset by a higher percentage of our profits being earned in lower rate international jurisdictions in this change in the location of our relative profits was caused by the growth of our international operations and lower domestic earnings as a proportion of total consolidated earnings 
for a more detailed description of our transaction with knopp  please read note  investments in variable interest entities to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
during  we also experienced a favorable impact on our effective tax rates due to a statutory increase in the us manufacturers tax deduction and an increase in expenditures eligible for our orphan drug credit 
in december  an extension of the research and development tax credit was enacted for years and upon enactment  we recognized an income tax benefit of million for qualifying expenditures from the full year in addition  our effective tax rate was increased by as a result of the million upfront payment incurred in connection with the collaboration and license agreement entered into with acorda therapeutics  inc acorda in the second quarter of our effective tax rate for was also favorably impacted by for changes in tax law which became effective during the first quarter of in certain state jurisdictions in which we operate and the favorable resolution of certain federal  state and foreign tax audits 
the resolution of these tax audits resulted in a reduction of our reserves for several uncertain tax positions  which had a favorable impact of on our effective tax rate 
our effective tax rate in was lower than in due to the net effect of changes in tax laws and the resolution of certain tax audits discussed above  as well as a higher percentage of our foreign earnings being subject to us income taxation in partially offset by the effect of the acorda licensing transaction 
the effect of the allocation of earnings was partially offset by certain tax credits and deferred tax assets realized as a result of our domestic reorganization 
our domestic and foreign reorganizations to our corporate structure involved the movement of certain personnel  operations and processes amongst our affiliates 
our effective tax rate will continue to be dependent upon the allocation of our profits amongst jurisdictions and the percentage of our foreign earnings which are subject to taxation in the us we expect our effective tax rate to be between and 

table of contents noncontrolling interest change for the years ended december  compared compared in millions  except percentages to to net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests  net of tax for compared to  net income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased by million 
this decrease was primarily the result of the attribution of million of the million ipr d charge recognized upon consolidation of the knopp variable interest entity to the noncontrolling interest 
this decrease was partially offset by the million payment made to cardiokine upon the termination of our license agreement and an attribution of earnings from our foreign joint ventures 
for compared to  net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests primarily consisted of the attribution of earnings from our foreign joint ventures  which were relatively consistent in each year 
market risk we conduct business globally 
as a result  our international operations are subject to certain opportunities and risks which may affect our results of operations  including volatility in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign market in which we operate 
foreign currency exchange risk our results of operations are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations due to the global nature of our operations 
while the financial results of our global activities are reported in us dollars  the functional currency for most of our foreign subsidiaries is their local currency 
fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rates of the countries in which we do business will affect our operating results  often in ways that are difficult to predict 
for example  when the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies  the relative value of sales made in the respective foreign currencies decreases  conversely  when the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies  the relative amount of such sales in us dollars increases 
our net income may also fluctuate due to the impact of our foreign currency hedging program 
our foreign currency management program is designed to mitigate  over time  a portion of the impact on volatility in exchange rate changes on net income and earnings per share 
we use foreign currency forward contracts to manage foreign currency risk with the majority of our forward contracts used to hedge certain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
foreign currency gains or losses arising from our operations are recognized in the period in which we incur those gains or losses 
pricing pressure we operate in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present significant challenges 
many countries are reducing their public expenditures in light of the global economic downturn and the deterioration of the credit and economic conditions in certain countries in europe 
as a result  we expect to see continued efforts to reduce healthcare costs  particularly in certain of the international markets in which we operate 
the implementation of pricing actions varies by country and certain measures already implemented  which include among other things  mandatory price reductions and suspensions on pricing increases on pharmaceuticals  have negatively impacted our revenues 
in addition  certain countries set prices by reference to the prices in other countries where our products are marketed 
thus  our inability to secure adequate prices in a particular country may also impair our ability to obtain acceptable prices in existing and potential new markets 
we expect that our revenues and results of operations will be further negatively impacted if these  similar or more extensive measures are  or continue to be  implemented in other countries in which we operate 

table of contents credit risk we are subject to credit risk from our accounts receivable related to our product sales 
the majority of our accounts receivable arise from product sales in the us and europe with concentrations of credit risk generally limited due to the wide variety of customers and markets using our products  as well as their dispersion across many different geographic areas 
our accounts receivable are primarily due from wholesale distributors  large pharmaceutical companies and public hospitals 
we monitor the financial performance and credit worthiness of our large customers so that we can properly assess and respond to changes in their credit profile 
we operate in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present significant challenges 
we continue to monitor these conditions  including the volatility associated with international economies and associated impacts on the relevant financial markets and our business 
our historical write offs of accounts receivable have not been significant 
within the european union  our product sales in italy  spain and portugal continue to be subject to significant payment delays due to government funding and reimbursement practices 
the credit and economic conditions within these countries have continued to deteriorate throughout these conditions have resulted in  and may continue to result in  an increase in the average length of time that it takes to collect on our accounts receivable outstanding in these countries 
as of december   our accounts receivable balances in italy  spain and portugal totaled million  million and million  respectively  totaling approximately million 
approximately million of this amount was outstanding for greater than one year 
as of december   we had million of receivables that are expected to be collected beyond one year  which are included as a component of investments and other assets within our consolidated balance sheet 
our concentrations of credit risk related to our accounts receivable from product sales in greece to date have been limited as our receivables within this market are due from our wholesale distributor  for which related accounts receivable balances as of december   remain current and substantially in compliance with their contractual due dates 
as of december  our accounts receivable balances due from our distributor in greece totaled million 
however  the majority of our sales by our distributor are to government funded hospitals and as a result our distributor maintains significant outstanding receivables with the government of greece 
furthermore  the government of greece has recently required financial support from both the european union and the international monetary fund to avoid defaulting on its debt 
in the event that greece defaults on its debt  and could not pay our distributor  we may be unable to collect some or all of our remaining amounts due from the distributor 
the government of greece may also require pharmaceutical creditors to accept mandatory  retroactive  price deductions in settlement of outstanding receivables and we could be required to repay our distributor a portion of the amounts they have previously remitted to us 
the potential impact resulting from such mandatory actions remains uncertain  although delays or changes in the availability of government funding may adversely impact the operations of our distributor 
to date  we have not been required to repay such amounts to our distributor or take a discount in settlement of any outstanding receivables and do not intend to do so 
we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts was adequate as of december   however  if significant changes occur in the availability of government funding or the reimbursement practices of these or other governments  we may not be able to collect on amounts due to us from customers in such countries and our results of operations could be adversely affected

million upfront payment made to acorda on july   million used for share repurchases  and million in proceeds from the issuance of stock for share based compensation arrangements 

table of contents we have historically financed our operating and capital expenditures primarily through positive cash flows earned through our operations 
we expect to continue funding our current and planned operating requirements principally through our cash flows from operations  as well as our existing cash resources 
we believe that existing funds  when combined with cash generated from operations and our access to additional financing resources  if needed  are sufficient to satisfy our operating  working capital  strategic alliance  milestone payment  capital expenditure and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future 
in addition  we may choose to opportunistically return cash to shareholders and pursue other business initiatives  including acquisition and licensing activities 
we may  from time to time  also seek additional funding through a combination of new collaborative agreements  strategic alliances and additional equity and debt financings or from other sources should we identify a significant new opportunity 
we consider the unrepatriated cumulative earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries to be invested indefinitely outside the us of the total cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at december   approximately billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended for use in our foreign operations 
in managing our day to day liquidity in the us  we do not rely on the unrepatriated earnings as a source of funds and we have not provided for us federal or state income taxes on these undistributed foreign earnings

we mitigate credit risk in our cash reserves and marketable securities by maintaining a well diversified portfolio that limits the amount of investment exposure as to institution  maturity  and investment type 
the value of our investments  however  may be adversely affected by increases in interest rates  downgrades in the credit rating of the corporate bonds included in our portfolio  instability in the global financial markets that reduces the liquidity of securities included in our portfolio  and by other factors which may result in declines in the value of the investments 
each of these events may cause us to 
table of contents record charges to reduce the carrying value of our investment portfolio if the declines are other than temporary or sell investments for less than our acquisition cost which could adversely impact our financial position and our overall liquidity 
for a summary of the fair value and valuation methods of our marketable securities please read note  fair value measurements to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
the decrease in cash and marketable securities from december   was primarily due to the execution of our share repurchases programs  tax payments  purchases of property  plant and equipment  the million paid upon the acquisition of panima  and the million in payments made to knopp under our recent license and stock purchase agreements  along with other milestone payments 
these uses of cash were offset by cash generated from operations  net proceeds received from sales and maturities of marketable securities  net proceeds recorded from the sale of the san diego facility and proceeds from the issuance of stock under our share based compensation arrangements 
borrowings we have a million senior unsecured revolving credit facility  which we may choose to use for future working capital and general corporate purposes 
the terms of this revolving credit facility include various covenants  including financial covenants that require us to not exceed a maximum leverage ratio and  under certain circumstances  an interest coverage ratio 
this facility terminates in june no borrowings have been made under this credit facility and as of december  and we were in compliance with all applicable covenants 
in connection with our distribution agreement with fumedica  we issued notes totaling million swiss francs which were payable to fumedica in varying amounts from june through june in june  we repaid million swiss francs million of the outstanding amount 
as of december   our remaining note payable to fumedica has a present value of million swiss francs million and remains payable in a series of payments through june the notes are non interest bearing  have been discounted for financial statement presentation purposes  and are being accreted at an annual rate of 
as described in note property  plant equipment  on october   we sold the san diego facility and agreed to lease back the facility for a period of months 
because we do not qualify for immediate sales treatment due to our continuing involvement with the facility  we have accounted for these transactions as a financing arrangement and recorded an obligation of million on that date reflecting cash proceeds received  net of transaction costs 
as of december   our remaining obligation was million  which is reflected as a component of current portion of notes payable  line of credit and other financing arrangements within our consolidated balance sheet

working capital we define working capital as current assets less current liabilities 
the decrease in working capital from december   primarily reflects the overall increase in total current liabilities by million 
the increase in total current liabilities reflects increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses offset by the june repayment of certain fumedica notes payable as described above under borrowings 
the increase in accrued expenses is inclusive of an increase in the current portion of our medicaid and va accruals and accruals related to the restructuring activities we under took in the fourth quarter of and higher employee compensation accruals 

table of contents cash flows our net cash flows are summarized as follows change for the years ended december  compared compared in millions  except percentages to to net cash flows provided by operating activities net cash flows used in investing activities net cash flows used in financing activities operating activities cash flows from operating activities represent the cash receipts and disbursements related to all of our activities other than investing and financing activities 
cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by our earnings and changes in working capital 
we expect cash provided from operating activities will continue to be our primary source of funds to finance operating needs and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
operating cash flow is derived by adjusting our net income for non cash operating items such as depreciation and amortization  impairment charges and share based compensation charges  changes in operating assets and liabilities which reflect timing differences between the receipt and payment of cash associated with transactions and when they are recognized in results of operations  and changes associated with the payment of contingent milestones associated with our prior acquisitions of businesses 
for compared to  the increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by increased revenues and lower payments for us federal income taxes offset by an increase in accounts receivable and receivables due from unconsolidated joint business 
for compared to  the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by changes in other liabilities and taxes payable  primarily due to an increase in income tax payments of million which primarily resulted from increased earnings and the resolution of a number of audits in  the million upfront payment made to acorda on july  and the payment of certain accrued expenses and other current liabilities 
on november   we announced a restructuring plan that involves a workforce reduction and the consolidation of facilities 
during the fourth quarter of  we began to record restructuring charges and currently expect to incur total pre tax costs through the fourth quarter of totaling approximately million 
the majority of the cash expenditures associated with these charges will be paid in the first half of and we expect that substantially all payments will be made by the end of investing activities for compared to  the increase in net cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to net proceeds received from sales and maturities of marketable securities  offset by the million in payments made to knopp under our recent license and stock purchase agreements  the million payment made upon our acquisition of panima  our purchases of property  plant and equipment and the milestone payment made to the former shareholders of syntonix 
net proceeds received from sales and maturities of marketable securities in totaled million compared to net purchases of million made in for compared to  the increase in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to a decrease in collateral received under our securities lending program and an increase in net purchases of marketable securities and strategic and other investments offset by a reduction in purchases of property  plant and equipment and the milestone payment made to the former shareholders of conforma therapeutics  inc the decline in purchases 
table of contents of property  plant and equipment was primarily attributable to our hiller d  denmark manufacturing facility and certain other manufacturing upgrades 
financing activities for compared to  the increase in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to increases in the amounts of our common stock repurchased compared to the same period in in  we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock for approximately billion compared to million shares for approximately million in cash used in financing activities also includes the in net proceeds from the sale of the san diego facility  which is being accounted for as a financing arrangement and activity under our employee stock plans 
we received million in compared to million in related to stock option exercises and stock issuances under our employee stock purchase plan

as such  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
we consolidate variable interest entities if we are the primary beneficiary 

table of contents legal matters for a discussion of legal matters as of december   please read note  litigation to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us us gaap  requires us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we believe the most complex judgments result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and are significant to our consolidated financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates  judgments and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the most significant areas involving estimates  judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are as follows revenue recognition and related allowances  collaborative relationships  clinical trial expenses  consolidation of variable interest entities  valuation of contingent consideration resulting from a business combination  valuation of acquired intangible assets  including in process research and development  inventory  impairment and amortization of long lived assets and accounting for goodwill  investments  including fair value measures and impairments  share based compensation  income taxes  contingencies  and restructuring charges 
revenue recognition and related allowances we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of product has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
product revenues revenues from product sales are recognized when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  which is typically upon delivery 
however  sales of tysabri in the us are recognized on the sell through model  that is  upon shipment of the product by elan to its third party distributor rather than upon shipment to elan 
the timing of distributor orders and shipments can cause variability in earnings 
reserves for discounts and allowances we establish reserves for trade term discounts  wholesaler incentives  medicaid rebates  veterans administration and phs discounts  managed care rebates  product returns and other applicable allowances 
these reserves 
table of contents are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales 
our estimates take into consideration our historical experience  current contractual and statutory requirements  specific known market events and trends and forecasted customer buying patterns 
if actual results vary  we may need to adjust these estimates  which could have an effect on earnings in the period of the adjustment 
the estimates we make with respect to these allowances represent the most significant judgments with regard to revenue recognition 
in addition to the discounts and rebates described above and classified as a reduction of revenue  we also maintain certain customer service contracts with distributors and other customers in the distribution channel that provide us with inventory management and distribution services 
we have established the fair value of these services and classified these customer service contracts as sales and marketing expense 
if we had concluded that we did not receive a separate identifiable benefit or have sufficient evidence that the fair value did not exist for these services  we would have been required to classify these costs as a reduction of revenue 
healthcare reform in  healthcare reform legislation was enacted in the us this legislation contains several provisions that affect our accounting estimates 
although many provisions of the new legislation did not take effect immediately  several provisions became effective in these include an increase in the minimum medicaid rebate to states participating in the medicaid program from to on our branded prescription drugs  the extension of the medicaid rebate to managed care organizations that dispense drugs to medicaid beneficiaries  and the expansion of the b phs drug pricing program  which provides outpatient drugs at reduced rates  to include additional hospitals  clinics  and healthcare centers 
these incremental discounts have been factored into determining the amount and timing of our revenues on sales to certain customers and are based upon several assumptions about the implementation of this new legislation 
our estimates are based upon our knowledge of current events and actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates 
revenues from unconsolidated joint business we collaborate with genentech on the development and commercialization of rituxan 
revenues from unconsolidated joint business consist of our share of pre tax co promotion profits in the us  reimbursement of our selling and development expense in the us  and revenue on sales of rituxan in the rest of world  which consists of our share of pretax co promotion profits in canada and royalty revenue on sales of rituxan outside the us and canada by f 
hoffmann la roche ltd 
roche and its sublicensees 
pre tax co promotion profits are calculated and paid to us by genentech in the us and by roche in canada 
pre tax co promotion profits consist of us and canadian sales of rituxan to third party customers net of discounts and allowances less the cost to manufacture rituxan  third party royalty expenses  distribution  selling and marketing  and joint development expenses incurred by genentech  roche and us 
we record our share of the pretax co promotion profits in canada and royalty revenues on sales of rituxan outside the us on a cash basis 
additionally  our share of the pretax co promotion profits in the us includes estimates supplied by genentech 
actual results may ultimately differ from our estimates 
bad debt reserves bad debt reserves are based on our estimated uncollectible accounts receivable 
given our historical experiences with bad debts  combined with our credit management policies and practices  we do not presently maintain significant bad debt reserves 
concentrations of credit risk the majority of our accounts receivable arise from product sales in the united states and europe and are primarily due from wholesale distributors  large pharmaceutical companies and public hospitals 
we monitor the financial performance and credit worthiness of our large customers so that we can properly assess and respond to changes in their credit profile 
we continue to monitor economic conditions  including the volatility associated with international economies  and associated impacts on the relevant financial markets and our business  especially in light of the global economic downturn 
the credit and economic conditions within italy  spain  portugal and greece among other members of the european union have deteriorated throughout these conditions have resulted in  
table of contents and may continue to result in  an increase in the average length of time that it takes to collect on our accounts receivable outstanding in these countries 
as of december   our accounts receivable balances in italy  spain  portugal and greece  were million  million  million and million  respectively  totaling approximately million 
approximately million of these amounts were outstanding for greater than one year  none of which related to our greek distributor 
as of december   we had million of receivables that are expected to be collected beyond one year  which are included as a component of investments and other assets within our consolidated balance sheet 
to date  we have not experienced any significant losses with respect to the collection of our accounts receivable 
if economic conditions worsen and or the financial condition of our customers were to further deteriorate  our risk of collectability may increase  which may result in additional allowances and or significant bad debts 
royalty revenues we receive royalty revenues under license agreements with a number of third parties that sell products based on technology we have developed or to which we own rights 
the license agreements provide for the payment of royalties to us based on sales of these licensed products 
there are no future performance obligations on our part under these license agreements 
we record these revenues based on estimates of the sales that occurred during the relevant period 
the relevant period estimates of sales are based on interim data provided by licensees and analysis of historical royalties that have been paid to us  adjusted for any changes in facts and circumstances  as appropriate 
we maintain regular communication with our licensees in order to assess the reasonableness of our estimates 
differences between actual royalty revenues and estimated royalty revenues are adjusted for in the period in which they become known  typically the following quarter 
historically  adjustments have not been material when compared to actual amounts paid by licensees 
to the extent we do not have sufficient ability to accurately estimate revenues  we record such revenues on a cash basis 
collaborative relationships we evaluate our collaborative agreements for proper income statement classification based on the nature of the underlying activity 
amounts due from our collaborative partners related to development activities are generally reflected as a reduction of research and development expense because the performance of contract development services is not central to our operations 
for collaborations with commercialized products  if we are the principal we record revenue and the corresponding operating costs in their respective line items within our consolidated statements of income 
if we are not the principal  we record operating costs as a reduction of revenue 
as discussed within note  collaborations to our consolidated financial statements included in this report  genentech incurs the majority of continuing development cost for rituxan 
expenses incurred by genentech in the development of rituxan are not recorded as research and development expense  but rather reduce our share of co promotion profits recorded as a component of unconsolidated joint business revenue 
clinical trial expenses clinical trial expenses include expenses associated with cros 
the invoicing from cros for services rendered can lag several months 
we accrue the cost of services rendered in connection with cro activities based on our estimate of site management  monitoring costs  and project management costs 
we maintain regular communication with our cros to gauge the reasonableness of our estimates 
differences between actual clinical trial expenses and estimated clinical trial expenses recorded have not been material and are adjusted for in the period in which they become known 
consolidation of variable interest entities we consolidate variable interest entities in which we are the primary beneficiary 
for such consolidated entities where we own less than a interest  we record noncontrolling interest in our statement of income for the current results allocated to the third party equity interests 

table of contents effective january   we adopted a new accounting standard related to the consolidation of variable interest entities which affected how we determined whether a variable interest or interests give us a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity 
in determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity  we consider a number of factors  including our ability to direct the activities that most significantly affect the entity s economic success  our contractual rights and responsibilities under the arrangement and the significance of the arrangement to each party 
these considerations impact the way we account for our existing collaborative and joint venture relationships and may result in the future consolidation of companies or entities with which we have collaborative or other arrangements 
valuation of contingent consideration resulting from a business combination for acquisitions completed after january   we record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date 
each reporting period thereafter  we revalue these obligations and record increases or decreases in their fair value as an adjustment to contingent consideration expense within the consolidated statement of income 
changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations can result from adjustments to the discount rates and periods  updates in the assumed achievement or timing of any development milestones  or changes in the probability of certain clinical events and changes in the assumed probability associated with regulatory approval 
significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period 
accordingly  assumptions described above  could have a material impact on the amount of contingent consideration expense we record in any given period 
valuation of acquired intangible assets  including in process research and development we have acquired  and expect to continue to acquire  intangible assets through the acquisition of biotechnology companies or through the consolidation of variable interest entities 
these intangible assets primarily consist of technology associated with human therapeutic products and in process research and development product candidates 
when significant identifiable intangible assets are acquired  we generally engage an independent third party valuation firm to assist in determining the fair values of these assets as of the acquisition date 
management will determine the fair value of less significant identifiable intangible assets acquired 
discounted cash flow models are typically used in these valuations  and these models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to estimating the timing of and expected costs to complete the in process projects  projecting regulatory approvals  estimating future cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in process projects  and developing appropriate discount rates and probability rates by project 
we believe the fair values assigned to the intangible assets acquired are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given available facts and circumstances as of the acquisition dates 
if these projects are not successfully developed  the sales and profitability of the company may be adversely affected in future periods 
additionally  the value of the acquired intangible assets may become impaired 
we believe that the foregoing assumptions used in the ipr d analysis were reasonable at the time of the respective acquisition 
no assurance can be given  however  that the underlying assumptions used to estimate expected project sales  development costs or profitability  or the events associated with such projects  will transpire as estimated 
prior to january   we measured acquired ipr d in a business combination at fair value and expensed it on acquisition date if that technology lacked an alternative future use  or capitalized it as an intangible asset if certain criteria were met  however  effective january   if we are purchasing a business  the acquired ipr d is measured at fair value  capitalized as an intangible asset and tested for impairment at least annually until commercialization  after which time the ipr d is amortized over its estimated useful life 
if we acquire an asset or group of assets  that do not meet the definition of a business under applicable accounting standards  then the 
table of contents acquired ipr d is expensed on its acquisition date 
future costs to develop these assets are recorded to expense as they are incurred if the technology lacks alternative future uses 
inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined under the first in  first out fifo method 
included in inventory are raw materials used in the production of pre clinical and clinical products  which are expensed as research and development costs when consumed 
capitalization of inventory costs our policy is to capitalize inventory costs associated with our products prior to regulatory approval  when  based on management s judgment  future commercialization is considered probable and the future economic benefit is expected to be realized 
we consider numerous attributes in evaluating whether the costs to manufacture a particular product should be capitalized as an asset 
we assess the regulatory approval process and where the particular product stands in relation to that approval process  including any known safety or efficacy concerns  potential labeling restrictions and other impediments to approval 
we evaluate our anticipated research and development initiatives and constraints relating to the product and the indication in which it will be used 
we consider our manufacturing environment including our supply chain in determining logistical constraints that could hamper approval or commercialization 
we consider the shelf life of the product in relation to the expected timeline for approval and we consider patent related or contract issues that may prevent or delay commercialization 
we are sensitive to the significant commitment of capital to scale up production and to launch commercialization strategies 
we also base our judgment on the viability of commercialization  trends in the marketplace and market acceptance criteria 
finally  we consider the reimbursement strategies that may prevail with respect to the product and assess the economic benefit that we are likely to realize 
we expense previously capitalized costs related to pre approval inventory upon a change in such judgment  due to  among other potential factors  a denial or delay of approval by necessary regulatory bodies 
as of december  and  the carrying value of our inventory did not include any costs associated with products that had not yet received regulatory approval 
there is a risk inherent in these judgments and any changes we make in these judgments may have a material impact on our results in future periods 
obsolescence and unmarketable inventory we periodically review our inventories for excess or obsolete inventory and write down obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value 
if the actual net realizable value is less than that estimated by us  or if it is determined that inventory utilization will further diminish based on estimates of demand  additional inventory write downs may be required 
additionally  our products are subject to strict quality control and monitoring which we perform throughout the manufacturing process 
in the event that certain batches or units of product no longer meet quality specifications or become obsolete due to expiration  we will record a charge to cost of sales to write down any obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value 
in all cases product inventory is carried at the lower of cost or its estimated net realizable value 
impairment and amortization of long lived assets and accounting for goodwill long lived assets other than goodwill long lived assets to be held and used  including property plant and equipment as well as intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
if such circumstances are determined to exist  an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by the long lived asset  including its eventual residual value  is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists 
in the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the assets  the assets are written down to their estimated fair values 

table of contents we also regularly evaluate our current manufacturing utilization strategy and assess alternatives 
in june  we decided to stop further validation of our large scale manufacturing facility in hiller d  denmark following completion of the facility s operational qualification activities in the first half of as we continue to evaluate our current manufacturing utilization strategy 
recent manufacturing improvements have resulted in favorable production yields on tysabri  that along with slower than expected tysabri growth  have reduced our expected capacity requirements 
as a result  we have decided to delay the start of manufacturing activities at this site until additional capacity is required by the business 
if we decide to consolidate  co locate or dispose of certain aspects of our business operations  for strategic or other operational reasons  we may dispose of or vacate one or more of our properties 
our most significant intangible asset is the core technology related to our avonex product 
we believe the economic benefit of our core technology is consumed as revenue is generated from our avonex product  which we refer to as the economic consumption amortization model 
this amortization methodology involves calculating a ratio of actual current period sales to total anticipated sales for the life of the product and applying this ratio to the carrying amount of the intangible asset 
an analysis of the anticipated product sales of avonex is performed at least annually during our long range planning cycle  and this analysis serves as the basis for the calculation of our economic consumption amortization model 
although we believe this process has allowed us to reliably determine the best estimate of the pattern in which we will consume the economic benefits of our core technology intangible asset  the model could result in deferring amortization charges to future periods in certain instances  due to continued sales of the product at a nominal level after patent expiration or otherwise 
in order to ensure that amortization charges are not unreasonably deferred to future periods  we compare the amount of amortization determined under the economic consumption model against the minimum amount of amortization recalculated each year under the straight line method 
amortization is then recorded based upon the higher of the amount of amortization determined under the economic consumption model or the minimum amortization amount determined under the straight line method 
we completed our most recent long range planning cycle in the third quarter of this analysis is based upon certain assumptions that we evaluate on a periodic basis  such as the anticipated product sales of avonex and expected impact of competitor products and our own pipeline product candidates  as well as the issuance of new patents or the extension of existing patents 
based upon this analysis  we have continued to amortize this asset on the economic consumption model for the third and fourth quarters of  and expect to apply the same model for the next two quarters 
in addition  this analysis did not result in a significant change in the expected lifetime revenue of avonex 
if there are any indications that the assumptions underlying our most recent analysis would be different than those utilized within our current estimates  our analysis would be updated and may result in a significant change in the anticipated lifetime revenue of avonex determined during our most recent annual review 
for example  the occurrence of an adverse event  such as the invalidation of our avonex patent issued in september  could substantially increase the amount of related amortization expense as compared to previous periods or our current expectations  which may result in a significant negative impact on our future results of operations 
we did not recognize an impairment charge related to our long lived assets during  and goodwill goodwill totaled approximately  million as of december   and relates largely to amounts that arose in connection with the merger of biogen  inc and idec pharmaceuticals corporation 
our goodwill balances represent the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible net assets when accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
we assess our goodwill balance within our single reporting unit annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable to determine whether any impairment in this asset may exist and  if so  the extent of such impairment 
the provisions of this guidance require that we perform a two step impairment test 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of our reporting unit to its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to our reporting unit exceeds the fair value of our reporting unit  then the second step of the impairment test is performed in order to determine the implied fair value of our reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of our reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then the company records an impairment loss equal to the difference 

table of contents we completed our required annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of  and and determined in each of those periods that the carrying value of goodwill was not impaired 
in each year  the fair value of our reporting unit  which includes goodwill  was significantly in excess of the carry value of our reporting unit 
investments  including fair value measures and impairments we invest in various types of securities  including short term and long term marketable securities  principally corporate notes  government securities including government sponsored enterprise mortgage backed securities and credit card and auto loan asset backed securities  in which our excess cash balances are invested  equity securities in certain publicly traded biotechnology companies  some of which have collaborative agreements with us  equity securities of certain companies whose securities are not publicly traded and where fair value is not readily available  and investments in biotechnology oriented venture capital funds where fair value is not readily available 
in accordance with the accounting standard for fair value measurements we have classified our financial assets and liabilities as level  or within the fair value hierarchy 
fair values determined by level inputs utilize quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access 
fair values determined by level inputs utilize data points that are observable such as quoted prices  interest rates and yield curves 
fair values determined by level inputs utilize unobservable data points for the asset or liability 
as noted in note  fair value measurements to our consolidated financial statements  a majority of our financial assets and liabilities have been classified as level these assets and liabilities have been initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued utilizing third party pricing services 
the pricing services use many observable market inputs to determine value  including reportable trades  benchmark yields  credit spreads  broker dealer quotes  bids  offers  current spot rates and other industry and economic events 
we validate the prices provided by our third party pricing services by understanding the models used  obtaining market values from other pricing sources  analyzing pricing data in certain instances and confirming those securities trade in active markets 
we also have some investments classified as level whose fair value is initially measured at transaction prices and subsequently valued using the pricing of recent financing or by reviewing the underlying economic fundamentals and liquidation value of the companies 
we apply judgments and estimates when we validate the prices provided by third parties 
while we believe the valuation methodologies are appropriate  the use of valuation methodologies is highly judgmental and changes in methodologies can have a material impact on our results of operations 
impairment we conduct periodic reviews to identify and evaluate each investment that has an unrealized loss  in accordance with the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
an unrealized loss exists when the current fair value of an individual security is less than its amortized cost basis 
unrealized losses on available for sale debt securities that are determined to be temporary  and not related to credit loss  are recorded  net of tax  in accumulated other comprehensive income 
for available for sale debt securities with unrealized losses  management performs an analysis to assess whether we intend to sell or whether we would more likely than not be required to sell the security before the expected recovery of the amortized cost basis 
where we intend to sell a security  or may be required to do so  the security s decline in fair value is deemed to be other than temporary and the full amount of the unrealized loss is reflected within earnings as an impairment loss 
regardless of our intent to sell a security  we perform additional analysis on all securities with unrealized losses to evaluate losses associated with the creditworthiness of the security 
credit losses are identified where we do not expect to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the amortized cost basis of a security and are reflected within earnings as an impairment loss 

table of contents for equity securities  when assessing whether a decline in fair value below our cost basis is other than temporary  we consider the fair market value of the security  the duration of the security s decline  and the financial condition of the issuer 
we then consider our intent and ability to hold the equity security for a period of time sufficient to recover our carrying value 
where we have determined that we lack the intent and ability to hold an equity security to its expected recovery  the security s decline in fair value is deemed to be other than temporary and is reflected within earnings as an impairment loss 
share based compensation we make certain assumptions in order to value and record expense for our share based compensation arrangements 
we review and evaluate our assumptions regularly and  as a result  we confirm or change the assumptions used to value share based awards granted in future periods 
such changes may lead to a significant increase or decrease in the expense we recognize in connection with share based payments 
in connection with valuing stock options and our employee stock purchase plan  we use the black scholes options pricing model  which requires us to develop certain subjective assumptions 
the key assumptions that most significantly affect the calculation include the expected volatility of our stock  the expected term of the award and the expected forfeiture rate associated with our stock option plan 
for each of our restricted stock programs  we make assumptions in accounting for these awards  principally related to the forfeiture rate 
for our time vested and performance vested restricted stock awards  each period end  we also develop an estimate of each performance factor in order to estimate the actual number of shares that will be earned 
for our plan  the number of shares to be earned is based on company performance metrics  such as annual revenue and earnings per share 
thus  during the performance period  we estimate our full year revenue and earnings per share and then adjust the performance factor after the completion of the full year 
in addition  beginning in  we granted certain employees restricted stock units which will vest based on stock price performance  referred to as market stock units  as well as performance vested restricted stock units which will be settled in cash  rather than in shares  referred to as cash settled performance shares 
these market stock units use a binomial model or monte carlo simulation to value each award at the grant date and include key assumptions such as the expected market price of our stock on the vest date and the expected number of shares to be vested under the terms of the award 
the cash settled awards are marked to market at the end of each period  with fluctuations in value reported through earnings 
income taxes we prepare and file income tax returns based on our interpretation of each jurisdiction s tax laws and regulations 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income tax liability in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate by estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
significant management judgment is required in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
in performing this assessment  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
in making this determination  under the applicable financial accounting standards  we are allowed to consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and the effects of tax planning strategies 
our estimates of future taxable income include  among other items  our estimates of future income tax deductions related to the exercise of stock options 
in the event that actual results differ from our estimates  we adjust our estimates in future periods and we may need to establish a valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
we account for uncertain tax positions using a more likely than not threshold for recognizing and resolving uncertain tax positions 
we evaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis and consider various factors  that 
table of contents include  but are not limited to  changes in tax law  the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns  the effective settlement of matters subject to audit  new audit activity and changes in facts or circumstances related to a tax position 
we adjust the level of the liability to reflect any subsequent changes in the relevant facts surrounding the uncertain positions 
our liabilities for uncertain tax positions can be relieved only if the contingency becomes legally extinguished through either payment to the taxing authority or the expiration of the statute of limitations  the recognition of the benefits associated with the position meet the more likely than not threshold or the liability becomes effectively settled through the examination process 
we consider matters to be effectively settled once the taxing authority has completed all of its required or expected examination procedures  including all appeals and administrative reviews  we have no plans to appeal or litigate any aspect of the tax position  and we believe that it is highly unlikely that the taxing authority would examine or re examine the related tax position 
we also accrue for potential interest and penalties  related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
as of december   undistributed foreign earnings and other basic differences of non us subsidiaries included in consolidated retained earnings aggregated approximately billion 
we intend to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in operations outside the us  however  if we decide to repatriate funds in the future to execute our growth initiatives or to fund any other liquidity needs  the resultant tax consequences would negatively impact our results of operations 
it is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional tax that might be payable if such earnings were remitted to the us contingencies we are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings 
on a quarterly basis  we review the status of each significant matter and assess its potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim  asserted or unasserted  or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based only on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates 
these revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
restructuring charges we have made estimates and judgments regarding the amount and timing of our restructuring expense and liability  including current and future period termination benefits and other exit costs to be incurred when related actions take place 
we have also assessed the recoverability of certain long lived assets employed in the business and in certain instances shortened the expected useful life of the assets based on changes in their expected use 
when we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated  we record additional depreciation to reflect the assets new shorter useful lives 
severance and other related costs and asset related charges are reflected within our consolidated statement of income as a component of total restructuring charges incurred 
actual results may differ from these estimates

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have operations or maintain distribution relationships in the us  europe  middle east  canada  central and south america  australia  new zealand  japan  china  india and elsewhere in asia in connection with the sale of avonex and tysabri and in germany in connection with the sale of fumaderm 
we also receive royalty revenues based on worldwide product sales by our licensees and through genentech on sales of rituxan in the 
table of contents rest of world 
as a result  our financial position  results of operations and cash flows can be affected by market fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  primarily with respect to the euro  canadian dollar  swiss franc  danish krone  swedish krona  british pound  and japanese yen 
we use foreign currency forward contracts to manage foreign currency risk but do not engage in currency speculation 
the majority of our forward contracts are used to hedge certain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
we also use forward contracts to mitigate the foreign currency exposure related to certain balance sheet items 
we have not elected hedge accounting for the balance sheet related items 
the following quantitative information includes the impact of currency movements on forward contracts used in both programs 
as of december  and  a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign exchange rates compared to the us dollar across all maturities for example  a strengthening of the euro would result in a hypothetical decrease in the fair value of forward contracts of approximately million and million  respectively 
our use of this methodology to quantify the market risk of such instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of its accuracy or the accuracy of the related assumptions 
the quantitative information about market risk is limited because it does not take into account all foreign currency operating transactions 
certain of our debt instruments are variable rate instruments and our interest expense associated with these instruments is  therefore  subject to changes in market interest rates 
as of december  and  a basis point adverse movement increase in libor would increase annual interest expense by approximately million and million  respectively 
in addition  the fair value of our marketable securities is subject to change as a result of potential changes in market interest rates 
the potential change in fair value for interest rate sensitive instruments has been assessed on a hypothetical basis point adverse movement across all maturities 
as of december  and  we estimate that such hypothetical adverse basis point movement would result in a hypothetical loss in fair value of approximately million and million  respectively  to our interest rate sensitive instruments 
the returns from cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will vary as short term interest rates change 
a basis point adverse movement decrease in short term interest rates would decrease interest income by approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively 
we are exposed to equity price risks on the marketable portion of equity securities included in our portfolio of investments entered into for the promotion of business and strategic objectives 
these investments are generally in small capitalization stocks in the biotechnology industry sector 
we regularly review the market prices of these investments for impairment purposes 
a hypothetical adverse movement in market values would result in a hypothetical loss in fair value of approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively
