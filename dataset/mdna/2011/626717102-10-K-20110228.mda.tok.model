item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview murphy oil corporation is a worldwide oil and gas exploration and production company with refining and marketing operations in the united states and united kingdom 
a more detailed description of the company s significant assets can be found in item of this form k report 
murphy generates revenue primarily by selling oil and natural gas production and refined petroleum products to customers at hundreds of locations in the united states  canada  malaysia  the united kingdom and other countries 
the company s revenue is highly affected by the prices of oil  natural gas and refined petroleum products that it sells 
also  because crude oil is purchased by the company for refinery feedstocks  natural gas is purchased for fuel at its refineries and oil production facilities  and gasoline is purchased to supply its retail gasoline stations in the us that are primarily located at walmart supercenters  the purchase prices for these commodities also have a significant effect on the company s costs 
in order to make a profit and generate cash in its exploration and production business  revenue generated from the sales of oil and natural gas produced must exceed the combined costs of producing these products  amortization of capital expenditures and expenses related to exploration and administration 
profits and generation of cash in the company s refining and marketing operations are dependent upon achieving adequate margins  which are determined by the sales prices for refined petroleum products less the costs of purchased refinery feedstocks and gasoline and expenses associated with manufacturing  transporting and marketing these products 
murphy also incurs certain costs for general company administration and for capital borrowed from lending institutions 
worldwide oil and north american natural gas prices were higher in than in  but these prices were significantly lower on average in than in the sales price for a barrel of west texas intermediate crude oil averaged in  in and in the nymex natural gas price per million british thermal units mmbtu averaged in  in and in crude oil prices generally strengthened in as the worldwide economy began to show signs of recovery following the deep recession that began in wti oil prices in averaged higher than the year began with quite low demand for hydrocarbons and consequently very weak prices for oil and natural gas 
crude oil and natural gas prices rose as progressed as the slow economic recovery began 
crude oil and north american natural gas prices fell precipitously with the economic decline in late changes in the price of crude oil and natural gas have a significant impact on the profitability of the company  especially the price of crude oil as oil represented approximately of the total hydrocarbons produced on an energy equivalent basis one barrel of oil equals six thousand cubic feet of natural gas by the company in in  the percentage of hydrocarbon production represented by oil is expected to decline to about due to start up of significant natural gas production in the first quarter at the tupper west area in british columbia 
if the prices for crude oil and natural gas should weaken in or beyond  the company would expect this to have an unfavorable impact on operating profits for its exploration and production business 
such lower oil and gas prices could  but may not  have a favorable impact on the company s refining and marketing operating profits 
results of operations murphy had net income in of million per diluted share compared to net income of million per diluted share in the prior year included income from discontinued operations in ecuador of million per diluted share 
income from discontinued operations in primarily arose from a gain on disposal of all ecuador assets in march excluding ecuador  income from continuing operations was million per diluted share in and million per diluted share in income in rose for both the exploration and production e p and refining and marketing r m operations compared to the prior year 
earnings for the company s e p operations increased in primarily due to higher sales prices and sales volumes of crude oil and natural gas 
the company s r m earnings were higher in primarily due to stronger margins on us retail gasoline fuel sales 
earnings in were unfavorably affected compared to by higher net costs associated with corporate activities that were not allocated to operating segments  with the higher costs primarily caused by an unfavorable variance for the effects of transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
net income in of million per diluted share was well below net income in of billion per diluted share 
the large decline in net income in comparison to was attributable to lower earnings in both the e p and r m operations 
weaker oil and natural gas sales prices in were the primary reasons for lower earnings in the e p business  while lower retail gasoline margins in the us and weaker refining margins in the us led 
table of contents to the earnings decline for r m 
the net cost of corporate activities not allocated to the operating segments was lower in than in income from continuing operations  excluding results from ecuador operations which are reported as discontinued operations  was million per diluted share in compared to billion per diluted share in further explanations of each of these variances are found in the following sections 
vs 
net income in was million per diluted share compared to million per diluted share in the results included income from discontinued operations of million per diluted share 
the discontinued operations income was associated with ecuador properties sold in march and primarily arose from an after tax gain on disposal of million 
income from continuing operations in and were million per diluted share and million per diluted share  respectively 
the higher income from continuing operations compared to was caused by higher earnings in both the exploration and production e p and refining and marketing r m businesses  but these were partially offset by higher net costs for unallocated corporate activities 
e p income from continuing operations improved million in  primarily due to a per barrel higher realized sales price for crude oil in the most recent year 
the results were impacted by two unusual items 
first  an after tax gain of million in was derived from a recovery of certain deepwater gulf of mexico federal royalties paid in prior years 
second  an after tax charge of million was recorded in associated with a required one time working interest redetermination at the terra nova field  offshore eastern canada 
the e p results were also favorably affected  but in less significant measures  by higher sales volumes for crude oil and natural gas and higher sales prices for natural gas 
e p was unfavorably affected in compared to the prior year by higher expenses for exploration  production  depreciation and administration 
income from r m operations was million more in  with the improvement mostly attributable to slightly more than a per gallon improvement in margins on sale of gasoline at us retail marketing stations 
this was partially offset by higher net losses in for uk r m operations 
the net costs of corporate activities were higher by million in  mostly attributable to unfavorable effects of transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
to a lesser degree  the corporate net costs were unfavorably affected by lower interest income and higher expenses for interest and administration 
the unfavorable variance in foreign currency transactions in was primarily attributable to a strengthening of the malaysian ringgit versus the us dollar and weakening of the british pound sterling against the us dollar during the year 
sales and other operating revenues grew billion in compared to mostly due to higher sales prices for gasoline and other motor fuels in the current year 
additionally  higher sales prices and sales volumes for crude oil and natural gas in the e p segment contributed to the increase in revenue 
gain on sale of assets was million less in than because the prior year included a million gain on sale of a small canadian natural gas field 
interest and other operating income loss declined by million in compared to mostly due to a million unfavorable variance from the effects of transactions denominated in foreign currencies  plus nonrecurring interest income in of million associated with a recovery of federal royalties paid in prior years for production at certain deepwater gulf of mexico fields 
the expense associated with crude oil and product purchases increased by billion in compared to due to higher average costs in the current year for crude oil feedstocks at the company s three refineries and due to the higher costs of wholesale gasoline and other motor fuels which were purchased for resale at the company s retail fueling stations in the us and us operating expenses were million higher in than due to a combination of higher oil and natural gas production costs  higher operating costs associated with the three oil refineries  and higher costs for us retail gasoline station operations 
exploration expenses rose million in compared to due to higher geophysical costs in the gulf of mexico and republic of the congo  higher amortization expense for undeveloped leases in the eagle ford shale  and higher administrative office and study costs in foreign locations 
exploration costs in included lower dry hole costs in malaysia  australia and the us  which more than offset higher dry hole costs in republic of the congo  suriname and the uk selling and general expenses were million higher in compared to the prior year primarily due to higher employee compensation costs 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense rose million in versus due to higher natural gas and crude oil sales volumes in  higher e p per unit depreciation rates  and higher r m depreciation that included a new ethanol production facility  more us retail gasoline stations and the crude unit expansion at the milford haven  wales  refinery that was completed in impairment of properties was nil in and million in  with the prior year costs related to write off of an underperforming natural gas field in the gulf of mexico 
accretion of asset retirement obligations was million more in than primarily due to higher discounted abandonment liabilities in the current year for wells drilled in malaysia and for synthetic oil operations at syncrude 
expense for redetermination of working interest at the terra nova field was million less in than 
table of contents because the prior year included cumulative costs for the period of december through  while costs related only to current year volumes sold by the company prior to the effective date of the final settlement 
interest expense was million higher in primarily due to nine months of interest in the current year on nonrecourse debt associated with the hankinson  north dakota  ethanol production facility  compared to three months of interest on this debt in the prior year following the october  acquisition date 
the nonrecourse debt was paid off by the company in september the higher nonrecourse debt interest was mostly offset by lower interest expense on outstanding general bank financing balances in capitalized interest was million less in than in the prior year due to interest amounts allocated to the sarawak natural gas development in prior to start up of operations later that year  partially offset by higher interest allocated to the tupper west gas development in income tax expense in was million more than due to higher pretax earnings and a slightly higher overall effective tax rate in the current year 
the consolidated effective tax rate was in compared to in  with the rate increase in the current year caused by a larger percentage of earnings in higher tax jurisdictions in and due to higher current year exploration and other expenses in foreign jurisdictions where no income tax benefit can presently be recognized due to no assurance that these expenses will be realized in or future years to reduce taxes owed 
the tax rates in both and were higher than the us federal statutory tax rate of due to a combination of us state income taxes  certain foreign tax rates that exceeded the us federal tax rate  and certain exploration and other expenses in foreign taxing jurisdictions for which no income tax benefit is currently being recognized because of the company s uncertain ability to obtain tax benefits for these costs in or future years 
income from discontinued operations was million per diluted share in mostly due to an after tax gain of million on sale of ecuador operations in march there was no income from discontinued operations in vs 
net income in totaled million per diluted share compared to billion per diluted share in earnings included discontinued operations income of million per diluted share in compared to a loss of million per diluted share in discontinued operations were associated with the company s former operations in ecuador which were sold in march for an after tax gain of million 
income from continuing operations amounted to million per diluted share in  down from billion per diluted share in the lower earnings in from continuing operations was attributable to lower income in the exploration and production e p and refining and marketing r m businesses 
e p income from continuing operations was million lower in compared to  primarily attributable to weaker realized sales prices for crude oil  which were down about per barrel for the company s production 
other unfavorable impacts in included a million charge after taxes to effect an anticipated reduction in the company s working interest in the terra nova oil field offshore newfoundland  lower north american natural gas sales prices  gains on sale of canadian assets in that did not repeat in  and higher extraction costs for oil and gas produced in e p results in benefited from higher volumes of oil and gas produced  lower exploration expenses and after tax income of million from recovery of federal royalties paid between and on certain leases in the gulf of mexico 
income from r m operations was million lower in compared to  essentially attributable to two factors weaker retail gasoline marketing margins in the us and weaker refining margins in the uk the net cost of corporate activities was million less in than primarily due to gains from transactions denominated in foreign currencies in compared to losses on such transactions in during the us dollar generally weakened in comparison to the british pound sterling  which provided a favorable foreign currency impact to the company s earnings 
additionally  benefited from higher interest income  including interest due to the company through december  on the federal royalty refund  and lower net interest expense 
sales and operating revenues were billion less in than primarily due to lower prices realized on gasoline and other fuels sold by the company 
crude oil and natural gas sales prices were also lower in than but these lower prices were partially offset by income of million in associated with a recovery of federal royalties previously paid by the company on certain deepwater gulf of mexico properties 
gain on sale of assets classified in continuing operations was million less in than principally due to significant gains on two assets sold in canada in berkana energy and the lloydminster properties 
interest and other income in was million higher than due to a combination of more favorable income effects from transactions denominated in foreign currencies and interest income on the recovery of federal royalties 
crude oil and product purchases expense was billion less in than due mostly to the lower cost of gasoline purchased for resale in the us retail marketing operations 
operating expenses in were million less than mostly due to lower natural gas and other power costs in at synthetic oil operations in canada and at the company s three refineries 
exploration expense in was million below primarily due to less spending on geophysical data in the us  canada and malaysia  and less amortization expense for undeveloped lease costs in the tupper area in western canada 
selling and general expenses rose million in compared to primarily due to a combination of higher costs for employee 
table of contents compensation and professional services 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense was up million in mostly due to higher oil and natural gas production volumes and higher depreciation rates per barrel of oil equivalents produced  with the higher costs mostly caused by new fields that came on stream in impairment of long lived assets of million in was attributable to write off of the remaining net book value for one underperforming natural gas field in the gulf of mexico 
accretion of asset retirement obligations increased million in primarily due to future abandonment costs to be incurred on oil and gas wells drilled in malaysia in a charge of million was recorded in to reflect the estimated cash settlement to be paid on an anticipated reduction in the company s working interest in the terra nova field from the present to about retroactive to approximately december this redetermination process at terra nova was essentially completed in interest expense in was million less than primarily due to lower interest rates charged on certain bank loans during interest capitalized to oil and gas development projects in was million below the level due to commencement of production at the thunder hawk and azurite oil fields in the third quarter income tax expense was million less in than primarily due to lower pretax income in the effective tax rate on a consolidated basis increased from in to in due to a larger percentage of earnings in higher tax jurisdictions in and due to higher exploration and other expenses in foreign jurisdictions where no income tax benefit can presently be recognized due to no assurance that these expenses would be realized in or future years to reduce taxes owed 
the tax rates in both and were higher than the us federal statutory tax rate of due to a combination of us state income taxes  certain foreign tax rates that exceed the us federal tax rate  and certain exploration and other expenses in foreign taxing jurisdictions for which no income tax benefit is currently being recognized because of the company s uncertain ability to obtain tax benefits for these costs in or future years 
income from discontinued operations was million higher in than mostly due to an after tax gain of million on sale of ecuador operations in march segment results in the following table  the company s results of operations for the three years ended december   are presented by segment 
more detailed reviews of operating results for the company s exploration and production and refining and marketing activities follow the table 
millions of dollars exploration and production continuing operations united states canada malaysia united kingdom republic of the congo other refining and marketing united states manufacturing united states marketing united kingdom corporate and other income from continuing operations income loss from discontinued operations net income exploration and production earnings from exploration and production e p continuing operations were million in  million in and billion in income from e p continuing operations in was million more than in the increase was primarily attributable to higher sales prices for crude oil and other liquid hydrocarbons produced by the company 
the company s average realized sales price for crude oil  condensate and gas liquids in increased per barrel over the company s average natural gas sales prices in north american and sarawak malaysia were also higher in than e p income in included a million after tax one time benefit from recovery of previously paid federal royalties associated with certain fields in the deep waters of the gulf of mexico 
although both and had charges associated with a redetermination of working interest at the terra nova field offshore eastern canada  charges were higher by million due to that year including estimated costs to settle the period from december to  while included only costs for the current year 
the one time redetermination process was essentially 
table of contents completed in and reduced the company s working interest at terra nova from the original to 
earnings in benefited from higher crude oil and natural sales volumes 
crude oil and liquids sales volumes increased in while natural gas sales volumes rose 
the higher hydrocarbon sales volumes in led to higher expenses for production and depreciation of million and million  respectively 
the year also had higher exploration expenses of million compared to  essentially due to higher expenses related to geophysical activities  undeveloped lease amortization and administration  which were somewhat offset by lower expenses for dry holes 
crude oil sales volumes increased in in the us due to a full year of production at the thunder hawk field in the gulf of mexico  this field started producing in july heavy oil sales volumes in canada were lower in than due to lower gross production and a higher royalty rate in the seal area of western canada 
sales volumes in offshore canada were below levels mostly due to lower gross production at the terra nova field and a higher royalty rate at the hibernia field 
synthetic oil sales at syncrude increased in due to higher gross production compared to sales volumes for crude oil produced in malaysia were lower in due to less production at the kikeh field offshore sabah 
crude oil liquids sold in the uk rose in due to making up for undersold inventory barrels produced in at the schiehallion field 
crude oil sales increased in in republic of the congo due to a full year of production at the azurite field following production start up in august natural gas sales volumes in increased significantly compared to the prior year due to a full year of production and higher daily sales volumes at gas fields which started up in offshore sarawak malaysia  as well as higher sales volumes at the tupper area in western canada 
e p income from continuing operations in was million less than in primarily due to significantly lower realized sales prices for the company s crude oil production in the period was also unfavorably affected by several other factors  including lower north american natural gas sales prices  higher production and depreciation expenses  a million after tax charge for an anticipated reduction of its working interest in the terra nova field  and higher gains on asset sales in compared to the year benefited from higher oil and natural gas sales volumes  lower exploration expense and after tax income of million from recovery of previously paid federal royalties on production from certain deepwater gulf of mexico properties 
crude oil  condensate and gas liquids sales volumes from continuing operations were higher in compared to  compared to an increase in oil production volumes of in oil sales volumes did not rise as much as oil production volumes during primarily due to the timing of scheduling oil sales transactions at the kikeh field offshore malaysia 
sales volumes at kikeh were below production levels in due to an increase in the volume of unsold barrels at the field at year end and a higher percentage of such unsold inventory barrels at the field being attributable to the company s account 
during  kikeh sales volumes exceeded production  which effectively reduced the company s unsold inventory balance from year end higher us crude oil sales volume in was primarily attributable to a partial year of production at the gulf of mexico thunder hawk field  which started up in july  and less downtime in the gulf of mexico for hurricanes 
lower crude oil sales volumes in canada in were mostly attributable to the sale of the lloydminster heavy oil field in early and production declines at the maturing hibernia and terra nova fields 
lower crude oil sales volume in the uk in was primarily due to no sale at the schiehallion field during the year  as damage to sales equipment at the production facility caused the scheduled oil sale in december to be deferred until crude oil sales volumes at kikeh in rose compared to due to higher annual production 
natural gas sales volumes increased in and the improvement was partially attributable to higher gas volumes produced during in the gulf of mexico  the tupper area in western canada and at kikeh  and partially due to new production at the sarawak gas fields offshore malaysia following start up in september the company s realized crude oil sales prices averaged less in than and north american natural gas sales prices averaged below levels

table of contents a summary of oil and gas revenues  including intersegment sales that are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements  is presented in the following table 
millions of dollars united states oil and gas liquids natural gas canada conventional oil and gas liquids synthetic oil natural gas malaysia oil and gas liquids natural gas united kingdom oil and gas liquids natural gas republic of the congo oil total oil and gas revenues the company s total crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids production from continuing operations  which excludes discontinued operations in ecuador sold in march  averaged  barrels per day in   barrels per day in and  barrels per day in united states crude oil production averaged  barrels per day in  up from  barrels per day in the us increase was primarily attributable to a full year of oil production at the thunder hawk field that started up in july in the gulf of mexico 
heavy oil production in western canada declined from  barrels per day in to  barrels per day in due to a combination of lower gross production in the seal area plus a higher royalty rate there due to higher sales prices in crude oil production offshore canada fell from  barrels per day in to  barrels per day in essentially due to lower production levels at terra nova caused by field decline and a higher royalty rate at hibernia 
synthetic oil production of  barrels per day in exceeded volumes of  per day due to less downtime for maintenance in the current year 
crude oil and liquids production in malaysia averaged  barrels per day in  down from  barrels per day in  with the decrease mainly due to downtime in the current year at kikeh for well maintenance and installation of drilling equipment on the production facility 
crude oil production in the uk in was about flat with as higher production volumes at schiehallion almost offset lower volumes due to well decline at mungo monan 
oil production in republic of the congo rose to  barrels per day in after averaging  barrels per day for all of  the azurite field came on production in august oil production in the us increased from  barrels per day in to  barrels per day in with the increase mostly caused by start up of the thunder hawk field in july and higher production at the medusa and front runner fields in production of heavy oil in the western canada sedimentary basin was  barrels per day in  down from  barrels per day in  primarily due to the sale of the lloydminster property in early and due to decline at properties operated by a third party in the seal area 
oil production offshore canada fell from  barrels per day in to  barrels per day in due to field decline at terra nova and field decline and a higher net profit royalty rate at hibernia 
synthetic oil operations at syncrude had net production of  barrels per day in  up from  barrels per day in  with the increase caused by a lower royalty rate in due to sales prices significantly below those of the prior year 
oil production in malaysia increased from  barrels per day in to  barrels per day in  with the increase primarily due to higher production at the kikeh field  which recorded peak production levels during oil production in malaysia was also favorably affected in by condensate produced at the sarawak gas fields that started up in september and higher net oil production at the west patricia field 
a higher portion of production at west patricia was allocated to the company s account in as costs incurred for development of sarawak gas fields increased the level of west patricia oil used to recover costs under the production sharing contract for blocks sk and sk oil production in the uk was  barrels per day in  down from  barrels per day in  with the decline primarily due to more downtime at the schiehallion field  mostly due to a damaged export hose that required production to be shut in for nearly all of the fourth quarter 
the azurite field offshore republic of the congo came on production in august and averaged  barrels per day for the full year of the company sold its interest in block and other areas in ecuador in march and has accounted for ecuador as discontinued operations 
oil production in ecuador  excluded from the totals for continuing operations  averaged  barrels per day in and  barrels per day in 
table of contents worldwide sales of natural gas were million cubic feet mmcf per day in  mmcf per day in and mmcf per day in natural gas sales volumes in the us were mmcf per day in  down from production of mmcf per day as higher production at thunder hawk in the gulf of mexico and the eagle ford shale area did not fully offset declines at fields onshore south louisiana and at other fields in the gulf of mexico 
natural gas volumes in western canada increased from mmcf per day in to mmcf per day in essentially due to continued ramp up of tupper area production during the just completed year 
natural gas sales volumes in malaysia increased in for both the sarawak and sabah offshore areas 
sarawak production rose to mmcf per day in following volumes of mmcf per day in sarawak gas production began in september and as such was on production for all of versus four months in the company also continued ramp up of new wells at sarawak gas fields during the current year 
gas sales at the kikeh field averaged mmcf per day in  up from mmcf per day the prior year 
natural gas sales volumes in the uk increased from mmcf per day in to mmcf per day in as gas volumes rose at both the mungo monan and amethyst fields during the current year 
natural gas production in the us averaged mmcf per day in  compared to mmcf per day in the higher volume in was primarily attributable to the mondo nw field that reached peak production during  start up of the thunder hawk field in july and less downtime in the gulf of mexico due to hurricanes 
natural gas production in canada rose from mmcf per day in to mmcf per day in due to ramp up of tupper area production in western canada 
tupper started up in december natural gas production in malaysia also rose significantly in as the sarawak gas development started up in september and kikeh gas production  which started up in december  was onstream for a full year in natural gas production during at sarawak and kikeh averaged mmcf per day and mmcf per day  respectively 
natural gas production in the uk fell from mmcf per day in to mmcf per day in primarily due to the amethyst field being shut in for the first four months of for equipment repairs 
the company s average worldwide realized sales price for crude oil  condensate and gas liquids from continuing operations was per barrel in  per barrel in and per barrel in the average realized crude oil sales price increased in compared to the higher price for was slightly below the increase in west texas intermediate wti sales prices between the years 
other benchmark oil prices used for sale of company crude oil did not increase at the same rate as wti 
the increase in the sales price for appi tapis based crude oil during did not keep pace with the increase in the wti price due to differences in market conditions in asia versus the us during most of  the company sold its kikeh crude oil based on the appi tapis benchmark price 
in late  the company began to sell its kikeh crude oil based on a brent crude oil benchmark 
compared to  the company s average crude oil sales prices rose in the us to average per barrel  heavy oil sales prices in canada rose to an average of per barrel  offshore canada oil sold at per barrel  an increase of  canadian synthetic crude oil sold for more and averaged per barrel  crude oil produced in malaysia increased to an average price of per barrel  uk crude oil prices increased to per barrel  and crude oil sold in republic of the congo increased only to per barrel as the only sale in was near the end of the year when prices were above the average 
the decline in the company s average realized oil sales price of in compared to matched the decline in the average price of west texas intermediate wti crude oil during crude oil prices began to weaken in late as the economic downturn worsened 
crude oil prices started at low levels due to a weakening worldwide demand for energy  but improved as the year progressed 
compared to  the company s average crude oil sales prices fell in the us to per barrel  heavy oil prices in canada fell to per barrel  offshore canada oil was sold for less and averaged per barrel  synthetic crude oil sold for less at per barrel  crude oil in malaysia was down and averaged per barrel  and uk crude oil production sold for less at per barrel 
virtually all natural gas prices showed improvements in compared to the prices for natural gas generally rose in the latest year in sympathy with the increase in average crude oil prices during the same period 
the company s average sales prices for natural gas in north america increased to per mcf in natural gas produced offshore sarawak sold for more in than in and averaged per mcf 
natural gas produced in the uk sold at an average of per mcf in  a increase from 
table of contents the company s natural gas sales prices fell significantly in compared to as weaker demand for energy led to an oversupply of natural gas inventories 
the company s average realized north american natural gas sales prices were per thousand cubic feet mcf in  a decline of from the per mcf realized in in the uk the average sales price fell from per mcf in to per mcf in natural gas produced in offshore sarawak was sold at an average price of per mcf during the year 
based on sales volumes and deducting taxes at marginal rates  each per barrel and per mcf fluctuation in prices would have affected earnings from exploration and production continuing operations by million and million  respectively 
the effect of these price fluctuations on consolidated net income cannot be measured precisely because operating results of the company s refining and marketing segments could be affected differently 
production expenses from continuing operations were million in  million in and million in these amounts are shown by major operating area on pages f and f of this form k report 
costs per equivalent barrel during the last three years are shown in the following table 
dollars per equivalent barrel united states canada excluding synthetic oil synthetic oil malaysia united kingdom republic of the congo worldwide excluding synthetic oil production expense per equivalent barrel in the us increased in compared to due to a higher proportion of production in the later year coming from the higher cost thunder hawk field in the gulf of mexico 
cost per barrel for canada conventional oil and gas operations  excluding synthetic oil  was lower in than due to a larger portion of total hydrocarbons produced coming from the tupper gas area  but this was partially offset by higher unit costs for offshore operations at hibernia and terra nova 
the increase in production costs per barrel for synthetic oil operations in compared to was caused by higher maintenance and natural gas costs in the current year 
production expense in malaysia rose in compared to as higher well maintenance and workover costs at kikeh were only partially offset by a higher proportion of lower cost natural gas produced at fields offshore sarawak 
production expense in in the uk on a per unit basis was lower than due to less repair costs at schiehallion and higher natural gas production at amethyst 
per unit production expense in in republic of the congo was less than in due to higher production levels associated with ramp up of the field  which came onstream in august costs per barrel in the us increased in compared to due to start up of the thunder hawk field in july the per unit cost for canadian conventional oil and gas operations was flat in compared to as the benefit of a full year of natural gas production at tupper was offset by lower production volumes without a comparable reduction in costs at hibernia and terra nova 
lower cost per barrel in compared to at canadian synthetic oil operations was mostly caused by lower natural gas fuel costs 
production cost per unit in malaysia was lower in compared to due to higher oil production at kikeh  and new natural gas production offshore sarawak and higher natural gas production at kikeh that collectively altered the production mix toward lower cost natural gas in higher per barrel production expense in the uk in compared to was primarily attributable to lower production levels at the schiehallion and amethyst fields  both of which were offline for repairs for a portion of 
table of contents exploration expenses from continuing operations for each of the last three years are shown in total in the following table  and amounts are reported by major operating area on pages f and f on this form k report 
expenses other than leasehold amortization are included in the capital expenditures total for exploration and production activities 
millions of dollars dry holes geological and geophysical other undeveloped lease amortization total exploration expenses dry hole expense was million lower in than in despite a increase in spending for exploratory drilling 
dry hole expense in the us was lower in the current year mostly due to deferral of planned gulf of mexico drilling due to the moratorium imposed by the federal government following the april blowout and oil spill at the macondo well owned by other companies 
malaysian operations had lower dry hole expense in due to more successful exploratory drilling results and favorable adjustments to final costs on prior year wells 
dry holes in the uk in primarily related to a decision to expense a well drilled in for which studies in indicated a lack of economical development options based on current pricing levels 
dry hole expense in republic of the congo was higher in than due to drilling more unsuccessful wells in the mps block in the current year 
dry hole expense in in other foreign areas was less than in primarily due to an unsuccessful well offshore australia in the prior year 
geological and geophysical g g expenses were million higher in than areas of higher spending on seismic in the year included the eagle ford shale area of south texas  the mpn and mps blocks offshore republic of the congo and offshore malaysia 
these higher g g costs in were somewhat offset by lower spending in the tupper area of western canada and offshore suriname 
other exploration costs in were million above levels primarily due to higher administrative costs for operations in suriname  indonesia and australia in the current year 
undeveloped leasehold amortization expense rose million in compared to  primarily due to higher amortization associated with lease acquisition costs in the eagle ford shale area of south texas  partially offset by less amortization expense in following sanction of development at the tupper west property in august dry hole expense was million lower in than due to more successful exploratory drilling results during a year with higher drilling capital expended 
during  lower dry hole costs in malaysia and the us was somewhat offset by higher costs in australia and republic of the congo 
g g expenses were million lower in compared to the reduction in g g in was attributable to less spending on seismic in the gulf of mexico  the tupper area in western canada  and offshore sabah in malaysia  but included higher spending for seismic covering the semai ii concession  offshore indonesia 
other exploration costs were million lower in compared to mostly due to less office costs allocable to republic of the congo exploration activities in the current year 
undeveloped leasehold amortization expense was million lower in compared to mostly due to lower amortization for tupper and tupper west area leases in western canada  but partially offset by higher amortization costs for eagle ford shale leases in south texas in an impairment charge of million was recorded in to write off the remaining costs of a poorly performing natural gas field in the gulf of mexico 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense for exploration and production continuing operations totaled  million in  million in and million in the million increase in was primarily caused by higher overall volumes of oil and natural gas sold during the current year 
additionally  a higher proportion of production was derived from fields brought onstream in recent years under a higher cost development environment 
the million increase in compared to was primarily attributable to a combination of higher overall hydrocarbon production levels and start up of new fields in the gulf of mexico  western canada and republic of the congo that had higher per unit depreciation rates than older fields already on production 
the exploration and production business recorded expenses of million in  million in and million in for accretion on discounted abandonment liabilities 
because the abandonment liability is carried on the balance sheet at a discounted fair value  accretion must be recorded annually so that the liability will be recorded at full value at the projected time of abandonment 
the million increase in accretion expense in compared to was due to additional wells drilled during the latest year in several geographical areas and higher estimated abandonment costs for offshore operations in malaysia and synthetic oil operations in western canada 
the million increase in accretion costs in compared to was mostly attributable to additional wells drilled in at the kikeh and sarawak fields  offshore malaysia 

table of contents the effective income tax rate for exploration and production continuing operations was in  in and in the effective tax rate was slightly higher in than mostly due to tax barrels owed the government of republic of the congo under the production sharing agreement covering the azurite field 
more tax barrels were owed the government due to higher azurite production levels in the effective tax rate was higher in than due to both higher expenses in foreign tax jurisdictions where no tax benefit can be currently recognized due to lack of sufficient revenue to realize a current benefit and a higher percentage of profits in malaysia where the effective tax rate of is higher than the effective rates in the us and canada 
the effective tax rates in all three years exceeded the us statutory tax rate of due to higher overall foreign tax rates and exploration activities in areas where current tax benefits cannot be recorded by the company 
tax jurisdictions with no current tax benefit on expenses primarily include non revenue generating areas in malaysia  suriname  australia and indonesia 
each main exploration area in malaysia is currently considered a distinct taxable entity and expenses in certain areas may not be used to offset revenues generated in other areas 
no tax benefits have thus far been recognized for costs incurred for blocks h and p  offshore sabah  and blocks pm  offshore peninsula malaysia 
at december   million barrels of the company s us proved oil reserves and billion cubic feet of the us proved natural gas reserves were undeveloped 
more than of the total us undeveloped reserves on a barrel of oil equivalent basis are associated with the company s various deepwater gulf of mexico fields 
further drilling  facility construction and well workovers are required to move undeveloped reserves to developed 
in the western canadian sedimentary basin  total proved undeveloped natural gas reserves totaled billion cubic feet  with the migration of these reserves  primarily in the tupper and tupper west areas  dependent on both development drilling and completion of processing and transportation facilities 
in block k malaysia  all oil reserves of million barrels for the kakap field are undeveloped pending completion of facilities and development drilling directed by another company 
additionally  the kikeh field had undeveloped oil reserves of million barrels  which are subject to further development drilling before being moved to developed 
also in malaysia  there were billion cubic feet of undeveloped natural gas reserves at various fields offshore sarawak at year end  which were held under this category pending completion of development drilling and facilities 
on a worldwide basis  the company spent approximately billion in  billion in and million in to develop proved reserves 
refining and marketing the company s refining and marketing r m operations generated earnings of million in  million in and million in the r m earnings improvement of million in compared to was mostly attributable to more than a per gallon improvement in retail fuel marketing sales margin in the us and higher profits on merchandise sales at us retail stations in the r m earnings decline of million in compared to was driven primarily by significantly weaker margins in the us retail fuel marketing business and lower refining margins in the uk the company has announced its intention to sell its us refineries and uk refining and marketing operations in the company s r m operations in the united states generated earnings of million in  million in and million in us operations are further reported as segregated between manufacturing and marketing activities 
us manufacturing activities include two oil refineries and two ethanol production facilities  while us marketing activities include retail and wholesale fuel marketing operations 
us manufacturing operations generated profits of million in and million in  but incurred a loss of million in the million decline in manufacturing income in compared to was primarily caused by nonrecurring income of million in from insurance settlements at the meraux  louisiana  refinery 
the insurance settlements related to property damage from hurricane katrina in and damage caused by a refinery fire in final insurance proceeds for hurricane katrina related property damage exceeded amounts originally estimated to be recovered 
manufacturing results in benefited from higher crude oil throughputs at both us refineries  which occurred despite an approximate six week shutdown for a plant wide turnaround at the larger meraux refinery 
overall refining margins per barrel at the company s two us refineries were lower  however  in than during the prior year 
the meraux refinery ran a slightly higher mix of more expensive sweet crudes in and the refinery s product yield of higher value gasoline and distillates in was slightly below levels 
the manufacturing profit included higher earnings from the company s ethanol production facility in hankinson  north dakota 
the hankinson plant  which was acquired on october   was in operation for the full year of compared to three months of operations in in late  the company acquired an unfinished ethanol production facility in hereford  texas 
the company expects to complete construction and start up the hereford plant near the end of the first quarter 
table of contents united states manufacturing results in were improved by million compared to partially due to final insurance settlements in at the meraux refinery for hurricane katrina related property damage and a related crude oil spill and damage caused by a fire 
the insurance settlements provided pretax benefits of million during additionally  had slightly improved refining margins for the company s gulf coast refinery and higher asphalt sales volumes and asphalt margins at the superior  wisconsin refinery 
the hankinson ethanol facility generated profitable operations in the fourth quarter due to the favorable spread between ethanol sales prices and corn prices 
unit margins sales realization less costs of crude and other feedstocks  transportation to point of sale and refinery operating and depreciation expenses for us refining operations averaged per barrel in  compared to per barrel in and per barrel in meraux refinery throughput volumes of crude oil and other feedstocks averaged  barrels per day in   barrels per day in and  barrels per day in superior refinery throughput volumes averaged  barrels per day of crude oil and other feedstocks in  compared to  barrels per day in and  barrels per day in the meraux refinery underwent a full plant turnaround in early  and both us refineries were temporarily shut down for turnaround activities during marketing operations in the us generated earnings of million in  million in and million in profits in exceeded due to more than a per gallon improvement in margins on fuel sold in the company s retail marketing system 
additionally  the company had higher profits in on sale of merchandise in this business 
total fuel sales volumes per station at company operated sites in the us averaged about  gallons per month during  down from the prior year 
united states marketing profits fell million in compared to fuel margins in the retail chain were hurt in by both lower demand for gasoline and diesel due to the weak economy and generally rising wholesale fuel costs caused by crude oil prices that rose gradually during the year 
the large marketing profit in was caused by significant spreads between prices for wholesale and retail gasoline for a portion of that year 
united states refined product sales volumes averaged  barrels per day in  compared to  barrels per day in and  barrels per day in the increases in both and were mostly attributable to more finished products produced at the us refineries compared to the prior year  plus in a full year of ethanol production from the hankinson facility acquired in october  compared to three months of ethanol production in the retail marketing business built stations in  following additions of stations in the us retail marketing network included  stations at year end united kingdom r m operations incurred a loss of million in compared to a loss of million in and a profit of million in the losses in and for uk r m operations were primarily due to weak margins at the company s milford haven  wales  refinery 
additionally  in the refinery underwent approximately a two month plant wide turnaround that reduced crude oil throughputs in the most recent year 
the refining margin was hurt by weak demand for refined products in the uk and western europe during the two year period of and the soft demand led to an industry wide oversupply of gasoline and diesel products in the area 
unit margins in the united kingdom averaged per barrel in  per barrel in and per barrel in overall refined product sales volumes in the uk averaged  barrels per day in  down compared to  primarily due to downtime associated with the turnaround at the milford haven refinery in sales volumes of refined products in the uk declined to  barrels per day in compared to  essentially due to lower production of finished products at the company s milford haven  wales refinery 
corporate the after tax costs of corporate activities  which include interest income  interest expense  foreign exchange gains and losses  and unallocated corporate overhead  were million in  million in and million in the net cost of corporate activities rose million in compared to the most significant variance related to the effects of foreign currency exchange  which was associated with transactions denominated in currencies other than the respective operation s predominant functional currency 
the company had after tax losses from foreign currency exchange of million in  while had after tax gains of million 
the foreign currency exchange loss in was primarily associated with a stronger malaysian ringgit compared to the us dollar 
this led to costs associated with higher recorded future income tax liabilities  which are required to be paid in local currency 
the malaysian operation s functional currency is the us dollar 
foreign currency exchange losses were also experienced in the uk during caused by a stronger uk dollar compared to the british pound sterling 
this led to higher costs for us dollar denominated liabilities owed by the company s uk refining and marketing business  which has a sterling 
table of contents functional currency 
additionally  benefited from interest income of million associated with a recovery of federal royalties previously paid on certain deepwater gulf of mexico oil and natural gas production 
net interest expense  after capitalization of finance related costs to development projects  was million higher in than mostly due to lower interest capitalized on oil and natural gas development projects during the just completed year 
corporate activities had higher administrative and depreciation expenses in than in of million and million  respectively 
the increase in administrative expense in was primarily associated with higher employee compensation costs 
income taxes associated with corporate activities in were significantly favorable to due to higher net pretax costs in the later year 
the net cost of corporate activities in was million lower than in  primarily due to more favorable effects of foreign currency exchange 
foreign currency exchange after taxes was a gain of million in compared to a loss after taxes of million in the us dollar generally weakened against the british pound sterling in after having gained significant ground on the uk currency during the weaker dollar in reduced the cost of us dollar based liabilities for the sterling functional us r m business 
foreign currency transaction effects in canada  malaysia and other foreign countries were generally insignificant for the full year the corporate area also benefited in from higher interest income of million compared to  principally due to million million after taxes of interest recognized on a recovery of us federal royalties previously paid on certain production in the gulf of mexico 
the interest on royalties more than offset lower interest income earned in on cash deposits and other longer term investments as these amounts attracted much lower interest rates during compared to the prior year 
net interest expense  after capitalization of finance related costs to development projects  was million less in than  principally due to lower interest rates charged on certain borrowings under the company s credit facilities 
certain of these facilities charge interest based on a spread above libor rates  which were held low in due to weakness in the overall economy 
administrative and depreciation expenses associated with corporate activities were both slightly higher in compared to income tax expense in was significantly unfavorable to in the corporate area primarily due to the aforementioned favorable pretax variances for foreign exchange  interest income and net interest expense

refining and marketing capital expenditures totaled million in  million in and million in these amounts represented  and of capital expenditures from continuing operations of the company in  and  respectively 
refining capital spending was million in compared to million in and million in refining spending in included costs to reduce benzene production and construct a new laboratory at meraux  costs to meet compliance with ultra low sulfur diesel and mobile source air toxic requirements at superior  and costs to complete an expansion to increase crude oil throughput capacity at milford haven to  barrels per day 
refining spending in mostly included projects at meraux for benzene reduction  a distillate hydrotreater revamp and crude oil storage expansion  a sulfur recovery project at superior  and an ongoing crude oil capacity expansion project at milford haven 
refining capital in included project costs for additional sulfur recovery capacity and property acquisition and improvements at the meraux  louisiana  refinery  and a cogeneration energy plant at the milford haven  wales  refinery 
marketing expenditures amounted to million in  
table of contents million in and million in marketing capital expenditures in were primarily associated with building new retail fueling stations and acquiring land for new station sites in the us marketing capital expenditures in were primarily associated with new station builds and other improvements within the us retail gasoline station network 
marketing capital spending in was split between station construction costs and land acquisitions costs for existing and future retail gasoline stations 
the company added stations within its us retail gasoline network in  after adding in and in the company spent million in to acquire an unfinished ethanol production facility in hereford  texas 
the hereford facility is expected to be completed and in operation near the end of the first quarter 
in  the company spent million to acquire an ethanol production facility in hankinson  north dakota 
the hankinson ethanol plant was financed with an million nonrecourse loan from the seller and a cash payment of million 
the nonrecourse loan was repaid in see note d of the consolidated financial statements for further details about these acquisitions 
cash flows operating activities cash provided by operating activities was billion in  billion in and billion in cash provided by continuing operations in was billion more than primarily due to a drawdown of working capital other than cash in the current year and higher income from continuing operations 
the working capital reduction in included cash receipts of million related to recovery of federal royalties and associated interest income 
income associated with the royalty recovery was recorded in  but the cash proceeds were collected in early cash provided by continuing operations in was billion less than in primarily due to lower net income 
cash provided by operating activities was reduced by expenditures for abandonment of oil and gas properties totaling million in  million in and million in investing activities cash proceeds from property sales classified as continuing operations were million in  million in and million in the proceeds related to sales of two canadian assets  including the company s interests in berkana energy and the lloydminster heavy oil property  plus a sale of of its working interest in the mps block offshore republic of the congo 
during  the company generated cash of million from the sale of its working interest in block in ecuador 
operating results and cash flows associated with ecuador operations have been classified as discontinued operations in the company s consolidated financial statements 
property additions and dry hole costs used cash of billion in  billion in and billion in cash used to pay for capital expenditures was higher in compared to  but was lower in compared to  with these variances essentially in line with changes in capital expenditures in each year 
cash of billion  billion and billion was spent in  and  respectively  to acquire canadian government securities with maturities greater than days at the time of purchase 
proceeds from maturities of canadian government securities with maturities greater than days at date of acquisition were billion in  billion in and million in cash of million in  million in and million in was used for turnarounds at refineries and syncrude 
the increase in was attributable to plant wide turnarounds for both the meraux and milford haven refineries 
financing activities during and  the company used available cash flow to repay million and million  respectively  of debt 
during  the company borrowed million under debt agreements primarily to fund a portion of the company s development capital expenditures 
cash proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plans  including income tax benefits on stock options  amounted to million in  million in and million in in  the company paid million to partially finance the acquisition of the hankinson  north dakota  ethanol plant  the remaining million acquisition price was financed with a seller provided nonrecourse loan 
this nonrecourse loan was fully repaid in cash used for dividends to stockholders was million in  million in and million in the company raised its annualized dividend rate from per share to per share beginning in the third quarter of the company had previously increased the annualized dividend rate from per share to per share beginning in the third quarter of financial condition year end working capital total current assets less total current liabilities totaled million in and billion in the current level of working capital does not fully reflect the company s liquidity position as the carrying value for inventories under last in  first out accounting was million below fair value at december  cash and cash equivalents at the end of totaled million compared to million at year end 
table of contents long term debt  including nonrecourse loans  decreased by million during and totaled million at year end  representing of total capital employed 
long term debt decreased by million in stockholders equity was billion at the end of compared to billion a year ago and billion at the end of a summary of transactions in stockholders equity accounts is presented on page f of this form k report 
other significant changes in murphy s year end balance sheet compared to included a million reduction in the balance of short term investments in canadian government securities with maturities greater than days at the time of purchase 
the total investment in these canadian government securities was million at year end and million at year end these slightly longer term investments were purchased in each year because of a tight supply of shorter term securities available for purchase in canada 
a million increase in accounts receivable in was caused by higher sales prices and volumes for crude oil and finished products sold on credit terms by the company  mostly offset by collection in of a receivable recorded in the prior year associated with recovery of previously paid federal royalties  plus interest thereon  totaling million 
inventory values were million more at year end than in mostly due to higher valued crude and refined products held in storage within downstream operations in the later year  but partially offset by less costs for unsold crude oil production held in inventory in the current year 
prepaid expenses increased million in primarily due to higher prepaid income taxes in the uk short term deferred income tax assets were million higher at year end compared to due mostly to larger current temporary differences for expense deductions within downstream operations 
net property  plant and equipment increased by billion in as a significant level of property additions during the year exceeded the additional depreciation and amortization expensed 
goodwill increased million in due to a stronger canadian dollar exchange rate versus the us dollar 
deferred charges and other assets decreased million mostly due to reclassification of long term prepaid advances from this category to property  plant and equipment during  but partially offset by higher turnaround costs spent and deferred in at the meraux and milford haven refineries 
current maturities of long term debt at year end was essentially unchanged from accounts payable increased by million at year end compared to primarily due to higher amounts owed for refinery crude oil purchases and for e p drilling activities 
income taxes payable was million lower at year end than at the end of  primarily due to less us income tax liabilities owed in the current year 
other taxes payable were million higher mostly due to more value added taxes owed by the uk downstream operations at year end compared to other accrued liabilities increased by million in mostly due to a deposit received related to the pending sale of a natural gas storage asset in spain and higher postemployment plan liabilities classified as a current liability at december  the current portion of deferred income tax liabilities increased million in due to various short term temporary differences for tax deductions in canada 
noncurrent deferred income tax liabilities were million higher at year end mostly due to accelerated tax depreciation associated with the company s capital expenditures  primarily in malaysia and canada 
the liability associated with future asset retirement obligations increased by million mostly due to higher estimated future costs to retire assets in the gulf of mexico and at synthetic oil operations in western canada 
deferred credits and other liabilities were million more in compared to mostly due to higher noncurrent liabilities associated with postemployment benefit plans in the current year 
murphy had commitments for future capital projects of approximately billion at december   including million for field development and future work commitments in malaysia  and million for costs to develop deepwater gulf of mexico fields 
the primary sources of the company s liquidity are internally generated funds  access to outside financing and working capital 
the company uses its internally generated funds to finance the major portion of its capital and other expenditures  but it also maintains lines of credit with banks and borrows as necessary to meet spending requirements 
at december   the company had access to a long term committed credit facility in the amount of billion 
a total of million was borrowed under the committed credit facility at year end the most restrictive covenants under this committed credit facility limit the company s long term debt to capital ratio as defined in the agreements to 
the committed credit facility expires in at december   the company had uncommitted bank credit lines of approximately million  but no borrowings were outstanding under these lines 
the long term debt to capital ratio was approximately at year end in september  the company filed a form s registration statement with the us securities and exchange commission which permits the offer and sale of debt and or equity securities 
the company may use this shelf registration  if needed  in future years to raise debt or equity capital to fund operational requirements 
this shelf registration expires in september current financing arrangements are set forth more fully in note f to the consolidated financial statements 
the company anticipates that it may be able to repay a portion of its long term debt during this assumption is based on the anticipated sale of its three refineries and uk marketing assets during  plus an ability to closely match its spending plans to cash inflows during the year 
however  if the company is unable to sell these downstream assets or if future oil and natural gas prices and or refining 
table of contents and marketing margins weaken significantly  the company may have to borrow under available credit facilities to fund ongoing development projects 
the company s ratio of earnings to fixed charges was to in  to in and to in environmental matters murphy and other companies in the oil and gas industry are subject to numerous federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations dealing with the environment 
compliance with existing and anticipated environmental regulations affects our overall cost of business 
areas affected include capital costs to construct  maintain and upgrade equipment and facilities  in concert with ongoing operating costs for environmental compliance 
anticipated and existing regulations affect our capital expenditures and earnings  and they may affect our competitive position to the extent that regulatory requirements with respect to a particular production technology may give rise to costs that our competitors might not bear 
environmental regulations have historically been subject to frequent change by regulatory authorities  and we are unable to predict the ongoing cost to us of complying with these laws and regulations or the future impact of such regulations on our operations 
violation of federal or state environmental laws  regulations and permits can result in the imposition of significant civil and criminal penalties  injunctions and construction bans or delays 
a discharge of hazardous substances into the environment could  to the extent such event is not insured  subject us to substantial expense  including both the cost to comply with applicable regulations and claims by neighboring landowners and other third parties for any personal injury and property damage that might result 
murphy allocates a portion of its capital expenditure program to comply with environmental laws and regulations  and such capital expenditures were million in and are projected to be million in the most significant of those laws and the corresponding regulations affecting our us operations are the us clean air act  which regulates air emissions the us clean water act  which regulates discharges into us waters the us comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla  which addresses liability for hazardous substance releases the us federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra  which regulates the handling and disposal of solid wastes the us federal oil pollution act of opa  which addresses liability for discharges of oil into navigable waters of the united states the u 
s safe drinking water act  which regulates disposal of wastewater into underground wells regulations of the us department of the interior governing offshore oil and gas operations 
these laws and their associated regulations establish limits on emissions and standards for quality of air  water and solid waste discharges 
they also generally require permits for new or modified operations 
many states and foreign countries where the company operates also have or are developing similar statutes and regulations governing air and water as well as the characteristics and composition of refined products  which in some cases impose or could impose additional and more stringent requirements 
we are also subject to certain acts and regulations  including legal and administrative proceedings  governing remediation of wastes or oil spills from current and past operations  which include but may not be limited to leaks from pipelines  underground storage tanks and general environmental operations 
cercla commonly referred to as the superfund act  and comparable state statutes primarily address historic contamination and impose joint and several liability upon potentially responsible parties prp  without regard to fault or the legality of the original act that contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment 
cleanup of contaminated sites is the responsibility of the owners and operators of the sites that released  disposed  or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site 
cercla also authorizes the us environmental protection agency epa and  in some instances  third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover the costs they incur from the responsible persons 
in the course of our ordinary operations  we generate waste that falls within cercla s definition of a hazardous substance 
we may be jointly and severally liable 
table of contents under cercla for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which such hazardous substances have been disposed of or released into the environment 
cercla also requires reporting of releases to the environment of substances defined as hazardous or extremely hazardous and must be reported to the national response center  if they exceed an epa established reportable quantity 
the epa currently considers us to be a prp at one superfund site 
the potential total cost to all parties to perform necessary remedial work at this site may be substantial 
however  based on current negotiations and available information  we believe that we are a de minimis party as to ultimate responsibility at the superfund site and as such  we have not recorded a liability for remedial costs 
we could be required to bear a pro rata share of costs attributable to nonparticipating prps or could be assigned additional responsibility for remediation at this site or other superfund sites 
we believe that our share of the ultimate costs to clean up this superfund site will be immaterial and will not have a material adverse effect on murphy s net income  financial condition or liquidity in a future period 
we currently own or lease  and have in the past owned or leased  properties at which hazardous substances have been or are being handled 
although we have used operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time  hazardous substances may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by us or on or under other locations where these wastes have been taken for disposal 
in addition  many of these properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes were not under our control 
these properties and the wastes disposed thereon may be subject to cercla  rcra and analogous state laws 
under such laws we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators  to clean up contaminated property including contaminated groundwater or to perform remedial plugging operations to prevent future contamination 
while some of these historical properties are in various stages of negotiation  investigation  and or cleanup  we are investigating the extent of any such liability and the availability of applicable defenses  including state funding for remediation  and believe costs related to these sites will not have a material adverse affect on murphy s net income  financial condition or liquidity in a future period 
although certain environmental expenditures are likely to be recovered by us from other sources  no assurance can be given that future recoveries from these sources will occur 
therefore  we have not recorded a benefit for likely recoveries as of december  rcra and comparable state statutes govern the management and disposal of solid wastes  with the most stringent regulations applicable to treatment  storage or disposal of hazardous wastes 
we generate non hazardous solid wastes that are subject to the requirements of rcra and comparable state statutes 
our operating sites also incur costs to handle and dispose of hazardous waste and other chemical substances 
the types of waste and substances disposed of generally fall into the following categories spent catalysts usually hydrotreating catalysts  spent used filter media  tank bottoms and api separator sludge  contaminated soils  laboratory and maintenance spent solvents  and industrial debris 
the costs of disposing of these substances are expensed as incurred and are not expected to have a material adverse effect on net income  financial condition or liquidity in a future period 
however  it is possible that additional wastes  which could include wastes currently generated during operations  will in the future be designated as hazardous wastes 
hazardous wastes are subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements than are non hazardous wastes 
such changes in the regulations could result in additional capital expenditures and operating expenses 
we are also involved in personal injury and property damage claims  allegedly caused by exposure to or by the release or disposal of materials manufactured or used in our operations 
under our accounting policies  an environmental liability is recorded when such an obligation is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
if there is a range of reasonably estimated costs  the most likely amount will be recorded  or if no amount is most likely  the minimum of the range is used 
recorded liabilities are reviewed quarterly 
actual cash expenditures often occur one or more years after a liability is recognized 
under opa  owners and operators of tankers  owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines  and lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located are liable for removal and cleanup costs of oil discharges into navigable waters of the united states 
to the best of our knowledge  there has been no such opa claims made against murphy 
the epa has issued several standards applicable to the formulation of motor fuels  primarily related to the level of sulfur found in highway diesel and gasoline  which are designed to reduce emissions of certain air pollutants when the fuel is used 
several states have passed similar or more stringent regulations governing the formulation of motor fuels 
the epa s mandated requirements for low sulfur gasoline became effective in and both of our us refineries are capable of producing the required low sulfur gasoline 
each of the us refineries are also capable of producing ultra 
table of contents low sulfur diesel ulsd as required by the epa beginning in under the clean air act  the epa has issued requirements pursuant to the mobile source air toxics msat regulation for the corporate annual average of benzene content in gasoline  which is not to exceed by volume beginning january   with no individual facility to exceed by july equipment has been installed at the meraux and superior refineries to achieve msta compliance 
the energy independence and security act eisa was signed into law in december the eisa  through epa regulation  requires refiners and gasoline blenders to obtain renewable fuel volume or representative trading credits as a percentage of their finished product production 
eisa greatly increases the renewable fuels obligation defined in the renewable fuels standard rfs which began in september murphy is actively blending renewable fuel volumes through its retail and wholesale operations and trading corresponding credits known as renewable identification numbers rins to meet most of its obligation 
on july   the rfs standard came into effect requiring the blending phase in of ethanol  biodiesel  cellulosic and advanced renewable fuels 
murphy is meeting its obligations for rfs primarily through the rins system 
the federal water pollution control act of fwpca imposes restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into navigable waters 
permits must be obtained to discharge pollutants into state and federal waters 
the fwpca imposes substantial potential liability for the costs of removal  remediation and damages 
we maintain wastewater discharge permits for our facilities where required pursuant to the fwpca and comparable state laws 
we have also applied for all necessary permits to discharge storm water under such laws 
we believe that compliance with existing permits and foreseeable new permit requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our net income  financial condition or liquidity in a future period 
our us operations are subject to the federal clean air act and comparable state and local statutes 
we believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with these statutes in all states in which we operate 
amendments to the federal clean air act enacted in required most refining operations in the us to incur capital expenditures in order to meet air emission control standards developed by the epa and state environmental agencies 
under the epa s clean air act authority  the national petroleum refinery npr initiative global consent decree was used by the epa to undertake at virtually all us refineries an investigation of four marquee compliance areas  including i new source review prevention of significant deterioration for fluidized catalytic cracking units  heaters and boilers  ii new source performance standards for flares  sulfur recovery units  fuel gas combustion devices including heaters and boilers  iii leak detection and repair requirements  and iv benzene national emissions standards for hazardous air pollutants 
murphy began negotiations with the epa in  but was interrupted by the events of hurricane katrina 
the states of louisiana and wisconsin are both parties to the npr 
negotiations with epa resumed in and were essentially completed in under the global consent decree  the company agreed to pay a fine of million and committed to capital improvements that are anticipated to cost approximately million over the next eight years 
our meraux  louisiana  refinery is also currently negotiating with the louisiana department of environmental quality ldeq regarding three compliance order notice of proposed penalty co nopp notifications regarding air and water discharges 
while we are in various stages of negotiations and or settlement  the company has proposed a settlement offer related to these co nopp negotiations and has reached agreement either independently with the state of louisiana or as a condition of settlement of the federal global consent decree  with approval of the state of louisiana 
the company does not expect the settlement of this matter to have a material adverse effect on company s net income  financial condition or liquidity in a future period 
world leaders have held numerous discussions about the level of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions 
as part of these discussions  the kyoto agreement was adopted in and was ratified by certain countries in which we operate or may operate in the future  with the united states being the primary country that has yet to ratify the agreement 
while efforts were made at the copenhagen accord  held december   to strengthen the kyoto protocol which expires in  the delegates to the th session of the conference of the parties cop at copenhagen agreed only to take note of the proceedings and did not ratify or agree to a successor to the kyoto protocol 
we are unable to predict how us regulations if any associated with the kyoto agreement will impact costs in future years 
the european union has adopted an emissions trading scheme in response to the kyoto agreement in order to achieve reductions in greenhouse gas emissions 
our refining operations at milford haven currently have the most exposure to these requirements and may require purchase of emission allowances to maintain compliance with environmental permit requirements 
these environmental expenditures are expensed as incurred 

table of contents currently  various national and international legislative and regulatory measures to address greenhouse gas emissions including carbon dioxide  methane and nitrous oxides are in various phases of discussion or implementation 
these include a promulgated epa regulation  mandatory reporting of greenhouse gases for numerous industrial business segments  including refineries and offshore production  which became effective december  these were followed by a more recent regulation requiring mandatory reporting of greenhouse gases for petroleum and natural gas systems  including onshore exploration and production facilities  which became effective december  during  us federal legislation cap and trade legislation  epa s greenhouse gas endangerment finding  epa s prevention of significant deterioration and title v greenhouse gas tailoring rule  low carbon fuel standards  etc 
and various state actions were proposed to develop statewide or regional programs  each of which have or could impose mandatory reductions in greenhouse gas emissions 
the impact of existing and pending climate change legislation  regulations  international treaties and accords could result in increased costs to i operate and maintain our facilities  ii install new emission controls on our facilities  and iii administer and manage any greenhouse gas emissions trading program 
these actions could also impact the consumption of refined products  thereby affecting our refinery operations 
the physical impacts of climate change present potential risks for severe weather floods  hurricanes  tornadoes  etc 
at our meraux  louisiana  refinery in southern louisiana and our offshore platforms in the gulf of mexico 
commensurate with this risk is the possibility of indirect financial and operational impacts to the company from disruptions to the operations of major customers or suppliers caused by severe weather 
the company has repositioned itself to take advantage of potential climate change opportunities by acquiring renewable energy sources through the acquisition of two ethanol production facilities  thereby achieving a lower carbon footprint and an enhanced capability to meet governmental fuel standards 
the company is unable to predict at this time how much the cost of compliance with any future legislation or regulation of greenhouse gas emissions  or the cost impact of natural catastrophic events resulting from climate change  if it occurs  will be in future periods 
the company recognizes the importance of environmental stewardship as a core component of its mission as a responsible international energy company and has implemented sufficient disclosure controls and procedures to capture and process climate change related information 
the company s environmental  health  and safety committee  a standing committee of the board of directors  was created to oversee and monitor the company s environmental  health  and safety ehs policies and practices 
further  in february  our board approved a worldwide environmental  health  and safety policy the ehs policy  which is available on the company s web site 
in addition to requiring that the company comply with all applicable ehs laws and regulations  the ehs policy includes a directive that the company will continue to minimize the impact of our operations  products and services on the environment by implementing economically feasible projects that promote energy efficiency and use natural resources effectively 
we likewise apply this conscientious approach to the issue of climate change 
as a companion to the ehs policy  the company s web site also contains a statement on climate change 
not only does this statement on climate change include our goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions on an absolute basis while growing our upstream and certain downstream operations  the information on our web site describes actions we have already taken to move towards that goal 
while we are admittedly in the early stages of a process that will grow over time  the company has formed an internal climate change workgroup to address emerging climate change issues and improve energy efficiencies 
this climate change workgroup is working with the respective business units to focus on comprehensive climate change efforts aimed at preparing the company to succeed in a world challenged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 
these efforts include incorporating climate change into our planning processes  reducing our own emissions  pursuing new opportunities and engaging legislative and regulatory entities externally 
in support of these efforts  worldwide greenhouse gas inventories have been conducted since the initiatives cited above demonstrate the company s commitment regarding environmental issues  which are at the forefront of today s global public policy dialogue 
murphy is actively engaged in the legislative and regulatory process  both nationally and internationally  in response to climate change issues and to protect our competitive advantage 
additionally  murphy participates in the massachusetts institute of technology mit joint program on the science and policy of global change 
safety matters we are subject to the requirements of the federal occupational safety and health act osha and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers 
in addition  the osha hazard communication standard requires that certain information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees  state and local government authorities and citizens 
we believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with osha requirements  including general industry standards  record keeping requirements and monitoring of occupational exposure to regulated substances 

table of contents in  osha announced a national emphasis program nep for inspecting all refineries in the us for compliance with osha s process safety management psm regulations 
osha conducted an inspection of our meraux  louisiana refinery from july september  and on december   osha issued several compliance related citations and a proposed penalty 
the matter was settled with osha through payment of a  penalty with all of the osha items abated in  with concurrence from osha that the nep event is now closed 
other matters oil spill response plan each murphy offshore facility in the gulf of mexico has in place an emergency evacuation plan eep and an oil spill response plan osrp 
in the event of an explosion  personnel would be evacuated immediately in accordance with the eep and the osrp would be activated if needed 
in the event of an oil spill  the osrp would be executed as needed 
the eep is approved by us coast guard uscg and the osrp is approved by bureau of ocean energy management formerly the minerals management service 
the company also has comprehensive emergency and spill response plans for offshore facilities in international waters 
murphy s osrp utilizes a consortium of seasoned and well equipped contract service companies to provide response equipment and personnel 
one company has been contracted to provide spill containment and recovery equipment  including skimmers  boom  and vessels such as fast response boats and high volume open sea skimmer barges 
this company has hired other companies to store and maintain response equipment and provide certified tanks and barges 
murphy is a founding member of marine preservation association  which provides access to marine spill response corporation assets to support marine spills in the gulf of mexico and other offshore areas 
additionally  murphy has an agreement with another company to provide aerial dispersant spraying services 
we have further contracted with another company to utilize their equipment for oil containment should a well blowout occur 
impact of inflation general inflation was moderate during the last three years in most countries where the company operates  however  the company s revenues and capital and operating costs are influenced to a larger extent by specific price changes in the oil and gas and allied industries than by changes in general inflation 
crude oil and petroleum product prices generally reflect the balance between supply and demand  with crude oil prices being particularly sensitive to opec production levels and or attitudes of traders concerning supply and demand in the near future 
natural gas prices are affected by supply and demand  which are often affected by the weather and by the fact that delivery of gas is generally restricted to specific geographic areas 
prices for oil field goods and services have generally risen with certain of these price increases such as drilling rig day rates having been significant at times during the last few years primarily driven by high demand for such goods and services when oil and gas prices were strong 
as noted earlier  oil and natural gas prices have been extremely volatile over the last several years 
oil prices were very strong in early to mid  then fell precipitously in late and into early  then have generally strengthened since that time 
the prices for oil field goods and services generally rise in periods of higher oil prices and do not usually decline as significantly as oil and gas prices in a lower price environment 
should oil prices continue to rise in future periods  the company anticipates that prices for certain oil field equipment and services could rise sharply 
due to the volatility of oil and natural gas prices  it is not possible to determine what effect these prices will have on the future cost of oil field goods and services 
accounting changes and recent accounting pronouncements the company adopted new guidance issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb regarding accounting for transfers of financial assets effective january  this guidance makes the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity as defined previously no longer relevant for accounting purposes 
therefore  formerly qualifying special purpose entities must be reevaluated for consolidation by reporting entities in accordance with the applicable consolidation guidance 
this adoption of this guidance did not have a significant effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company adopted  effective january   new guidance issued by the fasb that requires a company to perform an analysis to determine whether its variable interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity 
the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity has both the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and the obligation to absorb potentially significant losses of the entity or the right to receive potentially significant benefits from the entity 
a company is required to make ongoing reassessments of whether it is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity 
this guidance also amends previous guidance for determining whether an entity is considered a variable interest entity 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a significant effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in july  the fasb issued new accounting guidance that expands the disclosure requirements about financing receivables and the related allowance for credit losses 
this guidance became effective for the company at december  because the company has no significant financing receivables that extend beyond one year  the impact of this guidance did not have a significant effect on its consolidated financial statement disclosures 
the company adopted new accounting guidance for noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements effective january  this guidance is applied prospectively  except for presentation and disclosure requirements which are applied retrospectively 
this guidance required noncontrolling interests to be reclassified as equity  and consolidated net income and comprehensive income shall include the respective results attributable to noncontrolling interests 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a significant effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company adopted new accounting guidance covering business combinations effective january  the new guidance established principles and requirements for how an acquirer in a business combination recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired business 
it also established how to recognize and measure goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase  if applicable 
this guidance impacts the recognition and measurement of assets and liabilities in business combinations that occur beginning in assets and liabilities that arose from business combinations that occurred prior to are not affected by this guidance 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a significant effect on the company s financial statements for the year ended december  the company is unable to predict how the application of this guidance will affect its financial statements in future periods 
the company adopted new accounting guidance which addressed disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities in january this guidance expanded required disclosures regarding derivative instruments to include qualitative information about objectives and strategies for using derivatives  quantitative disclosures about fair value amounts and gains and losses on derivative instruments  and disclosures about credit risk related contingent features in derivative agreements 
see note l of this form k for further disclosures 
in  the company adopted new accounting guidance for determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities 
this guidance specified that unvested share based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents whether paid or unpaid are participating securities and  therefore  need to be included in the earnings per share eps calculation under the two class method  and also required that all prior period eps calculations be adjusted retrospectively 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on the company s prior period eps calculations 
the company adopted new accounting guidance addressing certain equity method investment accounting considerations in january the guidance  which has been applied prospectively  addressed how to initially measure contingent consideration for an equity method investment  how to recognize other than temporary impairments of an equity method investment  and how an equity method investor is to account for a share issuance by an investee 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company adopted new accounting guidance addressing subsequent events effective june  the guidance clarified the accounting for and disclosure of subsequent events that occur after the balance sheet date through the date of issuance of the applicable financial statements 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a significant effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the fasb s accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles guidance became effective for interim and annual periods ended after september   and it recognized the fasb accounting standards codification as the single source of authoritative nongovernment us generally accepted accounting principles 
the codification superseded all existing accounting standards documents issued by the fasb  and established that all other accounting literature not included in the codification is considered nonauthoritative 
although the codification did not change us generally accepted accounting principles  it did reorganize the principles into accounting topics using a consistent structure 
the codification also included relevant us securities and exchange commission guidance following the same topical structure 
for periods ending after september   all references to us generally accepted accounting principles use the new topical guidelines established with the codification 
otherwise  this new standard did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 

table of contents the fasb has provided additional guidance regarding disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets  including how asset investment allocation decisions are made  the fair value of each major category of plan assets  and how fair value is determined for each major asset category 
this guidance was effective for the company as of december  upon adoption  no comparative disclosures were required for earlier years presented 
see note k of this form k for additional disclosures 
in december  the us securities and exchange commission sec adopted revisions to oil and natural gas reserves reporting requirements which became effective for the company at year end the primary changes to reserves reporting included a revised definition of proved reserves  including the use of unweighted average oil and natural gas prices in effect at the beginning of each month during the year to compute such reserves  expanding the definition of oil and gas producing activities to include non traditional and unconventional resources  which includes the company s canadian synthetic oil operations at syncrude  allowing companies to voluntarily disclose probable and possible reserves in sec filings  amending required proved reserve disclosures to include separate amounts for synthetic oil and gas  expanded disclosures of proved undeveloped reserves  including discussion of such proved undeveloped reserves five years old or more  and disclosure of the qualifications of the chief technical person who oversees the company s overall reserve process 
the company utilized this new guidance at december  and to determine its proved reserves and to develop associated disclosures 
the company chose not to provide voluntary disclosures of probable and possible reserves in this form k 
in january  the fasb issued guidance that aligned its oil and gas reporting requirements and effective date with the sec s guidance described above 
the united states congress passed the dodd frank act in among other requirements  the law requires companies in the oil and gas industry to disclose payments made to the us federal and all foreign governments 
the sec was directed to develop the reporting requirements in accordance with the law 
the sec has issued preliminary guidance and is seeking feedback thereon from all interested parties 
the preliminary rules indicated that payment disclosures would be required at a project level within the annual form k report beginning with the year ending december  the company cannot predict the final disclosure requirements that will be required by the sec 
significant accounting policies in preparing the company s consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  management must make a number of estimates and assumptions related to the reporting of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
application of certain of the company s accounting policies requires significant estimates 
the most significant of these accounting policies and estimates are described below 
proved oil and gas reserves proved oil and gas reserves are defined by the us securities and exchange commission sec as those quantities of oil and gas  which  by analysis of geoscience and engineering data  can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward  from known reservoirs  and under existing economic conditions  operating methods  and government regulation before the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire  unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain  regardless of whether deterministic method or probabilistic method is used for the estimation 
proved developed oil and gas reserves are proved reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared with the cost of a new well  or through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well 
although the company s engineers are knowledgeable of and follow the guidelines for reserves as established by the sec  the estimation of reserves requires the engineers to make a significant number of assumptions based on professional judgment 
sec rules require that we use an unweighted average of the oil and gas prices in effect at the beginning of each month of the year for determining proved reserve quantities 
these historical prices often do not approximate the 
table of contents average price that the company expects to receive for its oil and natural gas production in the future 
the company often uses significantly different oil and natural gas price and reserve assumptions when making its own internal economic property evaluations 
estimated reserves are subject to future revision  certain of which could be substantial  based on the availability of additional information  including reservoir performance  new geological and geophysical data  additional drilling  technological advancements  price changes and other economic factors 
changes in oil and gas prices can lead to a decision to start up or shut in production  which can lead to revisions to reserve quantities 
reserve revisions inherently lead to adjustments of the company s depreciation rates and the timing of settlement of asset retirement obligations 
the company s proved reserves of oil and natural gas are presented on pages f and f of this form k 
the positive revision in us proved oil reserves in was primarily associated with better than anticipated performance of wells at the thunder hawk and medusa fields in the gulf of mexico 
better well performance at the hibernia and terra nova fields led to favorable proved oil reserve revisions in canada in proved oil reserves for canadian synthetic oil operations had a positive revision in primarily due to a lower royalty 
the positive proved oil reserve revision in malaysia in primarily related to better well performance at the kikeh field 
a positive proved oil reserve revision in republic of the congo in was attributable to improved terms under the production sharing agreement that allocated a larger share of production at the azurite field to the account of the company beginning in october a favorable oil reserve revision in in the united states was attributable to favorable performance of the thunder hawk and front runner fields and federal royalty relief for various deepwater fields 
a favorable conventional oil revision in canada in was caused by performance of the terra nova field and improved heavy oil pricing which added reserves in the seal area 
due to changes in the sec s definition of proved oil reserves  which were first effective as of december   synthetic oil reserves are now included as proved oil reserves 
consequently  total synthetic oil reserves as of january  of million barrels were added to total oil reserves in the positive revision to synthetic oil reserves during was attributable to lower royalties compared to a year ago 
an unfavorable revision to oil reserves in malaysia in was due to current year drilling results for a well in the kikeh field  along with reduced entitlements at kikeh and west patricia due to increased prices at year end compared to year end oil reserves in the uk reflected an unfavorable revision in because of an anticipated reduction in life expectancy for major equipment at the schiehallion project 
an unfavorable us oil revision in resulted from updated reservoir modeling of one field in the deepwater gulf of mexico 
an unfavorable revision in canada in was related to low heavy oil prices at year end  but this was partially offset by a favorable impact from better field performance in at hibernia 
a favorable oil reserve revision in malaysia in was attributable to better than anticipated drilling results and additional drilling opportunities in the main reservoir at the kikeh field  coupled with better reservoir performance and artificial lift improvements at the west patricia field 
proved natural gas reserves in the us had positive revisions in due to better well performance at the thunder hawk and mondo fields in the gulf of mexico 
the positive gas reserve revision in canada in was attributable to performance at various wells in the tupper area of british columbia 
proved reserves of natural gas in malaysia were revised downward in due to higher prices leading to a lower future entitlement percentage for the company 
positive gas reserve revisions in the uk in were attributable to better well performance at all gas producing fields 
in  a positive us gas reserve revision was caused by favorable performance of the thunder hawk  front runner and mondo nw fields as well as federal royalty relief for various deepwater fields 
in malaysia  a combination of increased entitlements due to pricing and drilling performance at the sarawak gas project led to positive gas revisions in gas reserves in the uk were favorably revised in because of the amethyst field gas compression project and better mungo field performance 
an unfavorable natural gas reserve revision in malaysia in was related to entitlement adjustments under the production sharing contract for blocks sk and sk and gas volumes lost due to operational delays that restricted sales volumes at the kikeh field  offshore sabah 
the company cannot predict the type of oil and natural gas reserve revisions that will be required in future periods 
successful efforts accounting the company utilizes the successful efforts method to account for exploration and development expenditures 
unsuccessful exploration wells are expensed and can have a significant effect on net income 
successful exploration drilling costs  all development capital expenditures and asset retirement costs are capitalized and systematically charged to expense using the units of production method based on proved developed oil and natural gas reserves as estimated by the company s engineers 

table of contents in some cases  a determination of whether a drilled well has found proved reserves cannot be made immediately 
this is generally due to the need for a major capital expenditure to produce and or evacuate the hydrocarbon s found 
the determination of whether to make such a capital expenditure is  in turn  usually dependent on whether additional exploratory wells find a sufficient quantity of additional reserves 
under current accounting rules  the company holds well costs in property  plant and equipment in the consolidated balance sheet when the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and the company is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project 
based on the time required to complete further exploration and appraisal drilling in areas where hydrocarbons have been found but proved reserves have not been booked  dry hole expense may be recorded one or more years after the original drilling costs are incurred 
in  a dry hole was recorded for a well in the north sea that was drilled in extensive evaluations of this oil discovery determined in that recovery of hydrocarbons was not economical in the current price environment 
there were no dry holes in or that were drilled in prior years 
impairment of long lived assets the company continually monitors its long lived assets recorded in property  plant and equipment and goodwill in the consolidated balance sheet to make sure that they are fairly presented 
the company must evaluate its properties for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from future cash flows 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment at least annually 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations since the results are based on estimated future events 
such events include a projection of future oil and natural gas sales prices  an estimate of the amount of oil and natural gas that will be produced from a field  the timing of this future production  future costs to produce the oil and natural gas  future capital and abandonment costs  future margins on refined products produced and sold  and future inflation levels 
the need to test a property for impairment can be based on several factors  including but not limited to a significant reduction in sales prices for oil and or natural gas  unfavorable reserve revisions  expected deterioration of future refining and or marketing margins for refined products  or other changes to contracts  environmental regulations or tax laws 
all of these same factors must be considered when evaluating a property s carrying value for possible impairment 
in making its impairment assessments involving exploration and production property and equipment  the company must make a number of projections involving future oil and natural gas sales prices  future production volumes  and future capital and operating costs 
due to the volatility of world oil and gas markets  the actual sales prices for oil and natural gas have often been quite different from the company s projections 
estimates of future oil and gas production and sales volumes are based on a combination of proved and risked probable and possible reserves 
although the estimation of reserves and future production is uncertain  the company believes that its estimates are reasonable  however  there have been cases where actual production volumes were higher or lower than projected and the timing was different than the original projection 
the company adjusts reserves and production estimates as new information becomes available 
the company generally projects future costs by using historical costs adjusted for both assumed long term inflation rates and known or expected changes in future operations 
although the projected future costs are considered to be reasonable  at times  costs have been higher or lower than originally estimated 
in assessing potential impairment involving refining and marketing assets  the company evaluates its properties when circumstances indicate that carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from future cash flows 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations since the results are based on estimated future events  which include projections of future margins  future capital expenditures and future operating expenses 
future marketing or operating decisions  such as closing or selling certain assets  and future regulatory or tax changes could also impact the company s conclusion about potential asset impairment 
impairment expense of million was recorded in to write off the remaining carrying value of one underperforming natural gas field in the gulf of mexico 
based on an evaluation of expected future cash flows from properties at year end  the company does not believe it had any other significant properties with carrying values that were impaired at that date 
the expected future sales prices for crude oil and natural gas used in the evaluation were based on quoted future prices for the respective production periods 
these quoted prices often reflect higher expected prices for oil and natural gas in the future compared to the existing spot prices at the time of assessment 
if quoted prices for future years had been lower  the smaller projected cash flows for properties could have led to significant impairment charges being recorded for certain properties in in addition  one or a combination of factors such as lower future sales prices  lower future production  higher future costs  lower future margins on refining and marketing sales  or the actions of government authorities could lead to impairment expenses in future periods 
based on these unknown future factors as described herein  the company cannot predict the amount or timing of impairment expenses that may be recorded in the future 

table of contents income taxes the company is subject to income and other similar taxes in all areas in which it operates 
when recording income tax expense  certain estimates are required because a income tax returns are generally filed months after the close of its annual accounting period  b tax returns are subject to audit by taxing authorities and audits can often take years to complete and settle  and c future events often impact the timing of when income tax expenses and benefits are recognized by the company 
the company has deferred tax assets mostly relating to basis differences for property  equipment and inventories  and dismantlements and retirement benefit plan liabilities 
the company routinely evaluates all deferred tax assets to determine the likelihood of their realization 
a valuation allowance has been recognized for deferred tax assets related to basis differences for blocks h  p and pm in malaysia and blocks mps and mpn in republic of the congo  for exploration licenses in certain areas  the largest of which are australia and suriname  and for certain basis differences in the uk due to management s belief that these assets cannot be deemed to be realizable with any degree of confidence at this time 
the company occasionally is challenged by taxing authorities over the amount and or timing of recognition of revenues and deductions in its various income tax returns 
although the company believes that it has adequate accruals for matters not resolved with various taxing authorities  gains or losses could occur in future years from changes in estimates or resolution of outstanding matters 
accounting for retirement and postretirement benefit plans murphy oil and certain of its subsidiaries maintain defined benefit retirement plans covering most of its full time employees 
the company also sponsors health care and life insurance benefit plans covering most retired us employees 
the expense associated with these plans is determined by management based on a number of assumptions and with consultation assistance from qualified third party actuaries 
the most important of these assumptions for the retirement plans involve the discount rate used to measure future plan obligations and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
for the retiree medical and insurance plans  the most important assumptions are the discount rate for future plan obligations and the health care cost trend rate 
discount rates are based on the universe of high quality corporate bonds that are available within each country 
cash flow analyses are performed in which a spot yield curve is used to discount projected benefit payment streams for the most significant plans 
the discounted cash flows are used to determine an equivalent single rate which is the basis for selecting the discount rate within each country 
expected plan asset returns are based on long term expectations for asset portfolios with similar investment mix characteristics 
anticipated health care cost trend rates are determined based on prior experience of the company and an assessment of near term and long term trends for medical and drug costs 
based on bond yields at year end  the company has used a discount rate of at year end and beyond for the primary us plans 
although the company presently assumes a return on plan assets of for the primary us plan  it periodically reconsiders the appropriateness of this and other key assumptions 
the smoothing effect of current accounting regulations tends to buffer the current year s pension expense from wide swings in liabilities and asset valuations 
the company s normal annual retirement and postretirement plan expenses are expected to increase slightly in compared to based on the effects of a growing employee base 
in  the company paid million into various retirement plans and million into postretirement plans 
in  the company is expecting to fund payments of approximately million into various retirement plans and million for postretirement plans 
the company could be required to make additional and more significant funding payments to retirement plans in future years 
future required payments and the amount of liabilities recorded on the balance sheet associated with the plans could be unfavorably affected if the discount rate declines  the actual return on plan assets falls below the assumed return  or the health care cost trend rate increase is higher than expected 
as described above  the company s retirement and postretirement expenses are sensitive to certain assumptions  primarily related to discount rates and assumed return on plan assets 
a decline in the discount rate would increase annual retirement and postretirement expenses by million and million  respectively  and a decline in the assumed rate of return on plan assets would increase retirement expense by million 
legal  environmental and other contingent matters a provision for legal  environmental and other contingent matters is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
judgment is often required to determine when expenses should be recorded for legal  environmental and other contingent matters 
in addition  the company often must estimate the amount of such losses 
in many cases  management s judgment is based on interpretation of laws and regulations  which can be interpreted differently by regulators and or courts of law 
the company s management closely monitors known and potential legal  environmental and other contingent matters  and makes its best estimate of the amount of losses and when they should be recorded based on information available to the company 

table of contents contractual obligations and guarantees the company is obligated to make future cash payments under borrowing arrangements  operating leases  purchase obligations primarily associated with existing capital expenditure commitments  and other long term liabilities 
in addition  the company expects to extend certain operating leases beyond the minimum contractual period 
total payments due after under such contractual obligations and arrangements are shown below 
amount of obligation millions of dollars total after total debt including current maturities operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities total the company has entered into agreements to lease production facilities for various producing oil fields 
in addition  the company has other arrangements that call for future payments as described in the following section 
the company s share of the contractual obligations under these leases and other arrangements has been included in the table above 
in the normal course of its business  the company is required under certain contracts with various governmental authorities and others to provide financial guarantees or letters of credit that may be drawn upon if the company fails to perform under those contracts 
the amount of commitments as of december  that expire in future periods is shown below 
amount of commitment millions of dollars total after financial guarantees letters of credit total material off balance sheet arrangements the company occasionally utilizes off balance sheet arrangements for operational or funding purposes 
the most significant of these arrangements at year end includes operating leases of floating  production  storage and offloading vessels fpso for the kikeh and azurite oil fields  operating leases for production facilities at the thunder hawk and west patricia fields  a natural gas transportation contract for the tupper area in western canada and a hydrogen purchase contract for the meraux refinery 
the leases call for future monthly net lease payments through at kikeh  through at azurite  through at thunder hawk and through at west patricia 
the tupper transportation contract requires minimum monthly payments through the meraux refinery contract to purchase hydrogen ends in the hydrogen contract requires a monthly minimum base facility charge whether or not any hydrogen is purchased 
future required minimum annual payments under these arrangements are included in the contractual obligation table shown above 
outlook prices for the company s primary products are often quite volatile 
the price for crude oil is primarily attributable to the level of demand for energy 
in january  west texas intermediate crude oil traded in a band between and per barrel 
nymex natural gas traded in a band of to per mmbtu during this same time 
us refining margins in january were somewhat stronger than in late  but us retail marketing margins were squeezed by higher wholesale fuel costs during this period 
the company continually monitors the prices for its main products and often alters its operations and spending based on these prices 
the company s capital expenditure budget for was prepared during the fall of and based on this budget capital expenditures are expected to be slightly higher than levels 
since the budget was approved by the company s board of directors  crude oil prices have generally been above the levels assumed in the budget  but north american natural gas prices have generally trailed the budgeted prices 
based on a recent review of capital expenditure projects  capital expenditures in are projected to total approximately billion 
of this amount  billion or about  is allocated for the exploration and production program 
geographically  e p capital is spread approximately as follows each for the united states and malaysia  for canada and for all other areas 
spending in the 
table of contents us is primarily associated with development and exploration programs in the eagle ford shale 
the company believes that budgeted spending for exploration and development activities in the gulf of mexico is at risk due to the us government s delay in permitting all such activities following the macondo incident in in malaysia  the majority of the spending is for continued development of natural gas fields in blocks sk and sk offshore sarawak and at the kikeh and kakap fields in block k 
approximately one half of canadian spending in will relate to natural gas development activities at the tupper and tupper west areas in western canada  with the remainder to be spent on continued development of existing oil fields 
other spending is primarily in republic of the congo for continued development of the azurite offshore field and further exploration drilling in the mps block 
refining and marketing expenditures in should be about million  or of the company total  including funds for construction of additional us retail gasoline stations 
capital and other expenditures will be routinely reviewed during and planned capital expenditures may be adjusted to reflect differences between budgeted and actual cash flow during the year 
capital expenditures may also be affected by asset purchases  which often are not anticipated at the time the budget is prepared 
the company will primarily fund its capital program in using operating cash flow  but will supplement funding where necessary using borrowings under available credit facilities 
the company s budget calls for a partial pay down of long term debt during the year  primarily based on the assumption that worldwide refining and uk marketing assets will be sold during if oil and or natural gas prices weaken or refining and uk marketing assets are not sold  actual cash flow generated from operations or asset dispositions could be reduced such that borrowings might be required during the year to maintain funding of the company s ongoing development projects 
the company currently expects production in to average between  and  barrels of oil equivalent per day 
a key assumption in projecting the level of company production is the anticipated ramp up of natural gas production following a february start up at the tupper west area in western canada 
other key assumptions include the timing of and ramp up of oil production from well workovers at the kikeh field and well performance at the azurite field offshore republic of the congo 
in addition  continued reliability of production at significant operations such as syncrude  hibernia and terra nova and the continued demand for natural gas from our offshore malaysia fields are necessary to achieve the anticipated production levels 
forward looking statements this form k contains forward looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of these statements  which express management s current views concerning future events or results  are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  the volatility and level of crude oil and natural gas prices  the level and success rate of our exploration programs  our ability to maintain production rates and replace reserves  customer demand for our products  political and regulatory instability  and uncontrollable natural hazards 
for further discussion of risk factors  see item a 
risk factors  which begins on page of this annual report on form k 
murphy undertakes no duty to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risks associated with interest rates  prices of crude oil  natural gas and petroleum products  and foreign currency exchange rates 
as described in note l to the consolidated financial statements  murphy makes limited use of derivative financial and commodity instruments to manage risks associated with existing or anticipated transactions 
there were short term commodity derivative contracts in place at december  to hedge the value of about million barrels of crude oil at the company s refineries 
additionally  on this date the company had open fixed price corn purchase commitments of approximately million bushels of corn expected to be purchased and processed at the company s ethanol production facility 
the company also had open derivative contracts at that date to sell million bushels of corn at these fixed prices and buy it back at future prices in effect at the time the corn is actually purchased 
a increase in the respective benchmark price of these commodities would have reduced the recorded asset associated with these derivative contracts by approximately million  while a decrease would have increased the recorded asset by a similar amount
