item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents retail revenues retail customers are classified within residential  commercial  and industrial classes  with no single customer representing more than of pge s total retail revenues or of total retail deliveries 
commercial and industrial customer classes are not dominated by any single industry 
while the largest commercial and industrial customers constituted of total retail revenues in  they represented nine different groups  including retail  high technology  paper manufacturing  metal fabrication  health services and governmental agencies 
additional information on the customer classes follows 
residential customers include single family housing  multiple family housing such as apa rtments  duplexes  and town homes  mobile homes  and small farms 
pricing of service to the residential class is based on the costs pge incurs to provide electric service 
residential demand is sensitive to the effects of weather  with demand historically highest during the winter heating season although  due to the increased use of air conditioning in pge s service territory  the summer peaks have increased in recent years 
economic conditions can also affect demand from the company s residential customers  as historical data suggests that high unemployment rates eventually lead to a decrease in demand from the company s residential customers 
residential demand is also impacted by energy efficiency measures  however  the decoupling mechanism substantially mitigates the financial eff ects of such measures 
during  total residential deliveries decreased compared to  with milder weather conditions accounting for nearly half of the decrease 
during  total residential deliveries remained comparable to  however  on a weather adjusted basis they declined 
commercial customers consist of non residential customers who accept energy deliveries at voltages equivalent to those delivered to residential customers 
this customer class consists of most businesses  including small industrial companies  and public street and highway lighting accounts 
demand from the company s commercial customers is generally not affected as much by weather as the residential class 
in  however  the weather did contribute to the decline in deliveries compared to economic conditions and fluctuations in total employment in the region can also lead to corresponding changes in energy demand from commercial customers 
commercial demand is also impacted by energy efficiency measures  the financial ef fects of which are partially mitigated by the decoupling mechanism 
during  as the oregon economy lost approximately of its payroll  the company s commercial energy deliveries decreased compared to with milder weather  including a very cool summer in  contributing about one third of the decline 
during  as the oregon economy lost about of its payroll  the company s commercial energy deliveries decreased compared to industrial customers consist of non residential custom ers who accept delivery at higher voltages than commercial customers  with pricing based on the amount of electricity delivered and the applicable tariff 
demand from industrial customers is primarily affected by national and global economic conditions 
weather has little impact on this customer class 
a change in oregon s economic activity can also lead to a change in energy demand from the company s industrial customers 
in  the company s industrial energy deliveries rose compared to  driven by increased production levels by certain industrial customers in the latter half of in  total energy deliveries to industrial customers decreased compared to as industrial production declined 

table of contents the following table reflects averages over the past three year period by customer class 
retail energy deliveries and retail revenues are expressed as a percentage of the totals customer class average customers energy deliveries revenues residential commercial td style vertical align bottom  padding left px  padding top px  padding b ottom px  padding right px  industrial other accrued revenues  net consists of items that are not currently included in customer prices  but are expected to be included in prices in a future period 
such amounts include deferrals recorded under sb and regulatory mechanisms for the renewable adjustment clause  the power cost adjustment  and decoupling 
see state of oregon regulation in the regulation and rates section of this item for further information on these items 
other accrued revenues also include deferrals recorded pursuant to the residential exchange program rep 
under the rep  the bonneville power administration bpa provides federal hydropower benefits to residential and small farm customers of certain investor owned electric utilities 
pge receives monthly payments from bpa under the program and passes such payments along to eligible customers in the form of monthly billing credits 
in september  the bpa and pge entered into an agreement that provides for monthly payments through the term of the agreement  which extends to september pge received payments totaling million in each of the twelve month periods ended september  and  which were credited to customers 
payments for the twelve month period ending september  are expected to be approximately million  with benefits to be credited to eligible customers 
the company will continue to pursue ongoing benefits for its customers under the rep and  along with other investor owned utilities in the pacific northwest  is currently in settlement negotiations that would provide benefits from october  until the year wholesale revenues pge participates in the wholesale electricity marketplace in order to balance its supply of power to meet the needs of its retail customers  manage risk  and administer its current long term wholesale contracts 
the company s participation includes purchases and sales of power that result from economic dispatch decisions for its own generation  which contributes to pge s ability to secure reasonably priced power for its customers 
interconnected transmission systems in the western united states serve utilities with diverse load requirements and allow the company to purchase and sell electricity within the region depending upon the relative price and availability of power  hydro conditions  and daily and seasonal retail demand 
the majority of pge s wholesale electricity sales is to utilities and power marketers and is predominantly short term 
the company may net purchases and sales with the same counterparty rather than simultaneously receiving and delivering physical power  with only the net amount of those purchases or sales required to meet retail and wholesale obligations physically settled 
other operating revenues other operating revenues consist primarily of the sale of excess natural gas and oil  as well as revenues from transmission services  excess transmission capacity resales  pole contact rentals  and certain other electric services provided to customers 
seasonality demand for electricity by pge s residential customers is affected by seasonal weather conditions  as discussed above 
heating and cooling degree days are common measures used to analyze the effect of weather on the demand for electricity 
heating and cooling degree days  which measure how much the average daily temperature varies from degrees over a period of time  indicate the extent to which customers are likely to use  or have used  
table of contents electricity for heating or air conditioning 
the higher the numbers of degree days  the greater the expected demand for heating or cooling 
the following table indicates the heating and cooling degree days for the most recent three year period  along with year averages for the most recent year provided by the national weather service  as measured at portland international airport heating degree days cooling degree days year average for the table above indicates that during  heating degree days were down about from the prior year  while in demand for heating was greater than the year average  but less than what it was in demand for electricity for air cond itioning was down in due to the decline in cooling degree days from  which saw an unusually warm summer  while was a near average cooling degree year 
pge s all time high net system load peak of  mw occurred in december the company s all time summer peak of  mw occurred in july  driven by unusually warm weather  and exceeded the december winter peak of  mw 
the following table shows the company s average winter and summer loads for the periods indicated along with the corresponding peak load and month in which it occurred average load peak load mw month mw winter november summer august win ter december summer july winter december summer august the company tracks and evaluates both base load growth and peak capacity for purposes of long term load forecasting and int egrated resource planning as well as for preparing general rate case assumptions 
behavior patterns  conservation  energy efficiency initiatives and measures  weather effects  and demographic changes all play a role in determining expected future customer demand and the resulting resources the company will need to adequately meet those loads and maintain adequate reserves 

table of contents power supply pge relies upon its generating resources as well as short and long term power purchase contracts to meet its customers energy requirements 
the company executes economic dispatch decisions concerning its own generation  and participates in the wholesale market as a result of those economic dispatch decisions  in an effort to obtain reasonably priced power for its retail customers 
pge s base generating resources consist of five thermal plants  seven hydroelectric plants  and a wind farm located at biglow canyon in eastern oregon 
the volume of electricity the company generates is dependent upon  among other factors  the capacity and availability of its generating resources 
capacity of a given plant represents the mw the plant is capable of generating under normal operating conditions  net of electricity used in the operation of the plant 
the capacity of the company s thermal generating resources is also affected by ambient temperatures 
availability represents the percentage of the year the plant was available for operations  which reflects the impact of planned  forced and maintenance outages 
for a complete listing of these facilities  see item properties 
the company also promotes the expansion of renewable energy resources  as well as energy efficiency measures  to meet its energy requirements and enhance customers ability to manage their energy use more efficiently 
pge s resource capacity in mw was as follows as of december  capacity capacity capacity generation thermal natural gas coal total thermal hydro wind total generation nbs p  purchased power long term contracts capacity exchange mid columbia hydro confederated tribes hydro wind other total long term contracts short term contracts total purchased power total resource capacity for information regarding actual generating output and purchases for the years ended december   and  see the results of operations section of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condi tion and results of operations 

table of contents generation that portion of pge s energy requirements generated by its plants varies from year to year and is determined by various factors  including planned and forced outages  availability and price of coal and natural gas  precipitation and snow pack levels  the market price of electricity  and wind variability 
thermal pge has a ownership interest in boardman  which it operates  and a ownership interest in colstrip units and these two coal fired generating facilities provided approximately of the company s total retail load requirement in  compared to in and in the company s three natural gas fired generating facilities  port westward  beaver  and coyote springs  provided approximately of its total retail load requirement in  and these thermal plants  which have a combined capacity of approximately  mw  continue to provide reliable power for customers 
plant availability  excluding colstrip  was in  in and in  with colstrip availability in  in and in hydro the company s ferc licensed hydroelectric projects consist of two plants on the deschutes river near madras  oregon  four plants on the clackamas river and one on the willamette river 
the licenses for these proj ects expire at various dates from to these plants  which have a combined capacity of mw  provided of the company s total retail load requirement in  and  with availability of in those years 
northwest hydro conditions have a significant impact on the region s power supply  with water conditions significantly impacting pge s cost of power and its ability to economically displace more expensive thermal generation and spot market power purchases 
pge has a ownership interest in the mw pelton round butte hydroelectric project on the deschutes river  with the remaining interest held by the confederated tribes of the warm springs reservation of oregon tribes 
a year joint license for th e project  which is operated by pge  was issued by the ferc in the tribes have an option to purchase an additional undivided interest in pelton round butte at its discretion no sooner than january  and no later than july  the tribes have a second option to purchase an undivided interest in pelton round butte at its discretion no sooner than december  if both options are exercised by the tribes  the tribes ownership percentage would exceed wind biglow canyon wind farm biglow canyon  located in sherman county  oregon  is pge s largest renewable energy resource with wind turbines with a total installed capacity of approximately mw 
it was completed and placed in service in three phases between december and august in  biglow canyon provided of the company s total retail load requirement  compared to in and in  with availability at in  in  and in dispatchable standby generation dsg pge has a dsg program under which the company can start  operate  and monitor customer owned standby generators when needed to meet peak demand 
the program helps provide operating reserves for the company s generating resources and  when operating  can supply most or all of dsg customer loads 
as of december   there were projects that together can provide approximately mw of diesel fired capacity at peak times 
in addition  there were projects under construction that are expected to provide an additional mw 

table of contents fuel supply pge contracts for natural gas and coal supplies required to fuel the company s thermal generating plants  with certain plants also able to operate on fuel oil if needed 
in addition  the company uses forward  swap  option  and futures contracts to manage its exposure to volatility in natural gas prices 
coal boardman pge has fixed price purchase agreements that provide coal for boardman through the coal is obtained from surface mining operations in wyoming and montana and is delivered by rail under two separate ten year transportation contracts which extend through in the first half of  pge intends to seek requests for proposal for the purchase of coal for and beyond 
the terms of the contract and quality of coal is expected to be staged in alignment with the timing of the installation of required emissions controls 
for additional information on boardman s emissions controls  see the capital requirements section in item ld quo  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
natural gas port westward and beaver firm gas supplies for port westward and beaver are purchased up to months in advance  based on anticipated operation of the plants 
pge owns of the kelso beaver pipeline  which directly connects both generating plants to the northwest pipeline  an interstate natural gas pipeline operating between british columbia and new mexico 
currently  pge transports gas on the kelso bea ver pipeline for its own use under a firm transportation service agreement  with capacity offered to others on an interruptible basis to the extent not utilized by the company 
pge has access to  dth per day of firm gas transportation capacity to serve the two plants 
pge also has contractual access through april to natural gas storage in mist  oregon  from which it can draw in the event that gas supplies are interrupted or if economic factors require its use 
this storage may be used to fuel both port westward and beaver 
pge believes that sufficient market supplies of gas are available to meet anticipated operations of both plants 
the beaver generating plant has the capability to operate on no 
diesel fuel oil when it is economical or if the plant s natural gas supply is interrupted 
pge had an approximate day supply of ultra low sulfur diesel fuel oil at the plant site as of december  the current operating permit for beaver limits the number of gallons of fuel that can be burned daily  which effectively limits the daily hours of operation of beaver 
coyote springs the coyote springs generating station utilizes  dth day of natural gas when operating at full capacity  with firm transportation capacity on three pipeline systems accessing gas fields in alberta  canada 
pge believes that sufficient market supplies of gas are available for coyote springs  based on anticipated operation of the plant 
although coyote springs was designed to also operate on oil  such capability has been deactivated in order to optimize natural gas operations 
purchased power pge supplements its own generation with power purchased in the wholesale market to meet its energy requirements 
the company utilizes short and long term wholesale power purchase co ntracts to provide the most favorable economic mix on a variable cost basis 
such contracts have terms ranging from one month to years and expire at varying dates through pge s medium term power cost strategy helps mitigate the effect of price volatility on its customers due to changing energy market conditions 
the strategy allows the company to take positions in power and fuel markets up to five years in advance of physical delivery 
by purchasing a portion of anticipated energy needs for future years over an extended period  pge mitigates a portion of the potential future volatility in the average cost of purchased power and fuel 

table of contents the company s major power purchase contracts consist of the following also see the preceding table which summarizes the average resource capabilities related to these contracts capacity exc hange these five contracts provide pge with firm capacity to help meet the company s peak loads 
the contracts range from mw to mw and expire at various dates from february through december they include seasonal exchange contracts with other western utilities that help meet both winter and summer peaking requirements 
mid columbia hydro pge has long term power purchase contracts with certain public utility districts in the state of washington for a portion of the output of four hydroelectric projects on the mid columbia river 
the projects currently provide a total of mw of firm capacity  with actua l energy received dependent upon river flows 
confederated tribes pge has a long term agreement under which the company purchases  at market prices  the tribes interest in the output of the pelton round butte hydroelectric project 
wind the company has three long term contracts  which extend to various dates between and  that provide for the purchase of renewable wind generated electricity 
other these primarily consist of long term contracts to purchase power from various counterparties  including other pacific northwest utilities  over terms extending up to other also includes contracts that provide for the purchase of renewable solar powered electricity 
pge has invested in three photovoltaic solar power projects  with a combined installed capacity of mw  through separate limited liabil ity companies as follows installation completed in december  the first project has an installed capacity of approximately kw and is located on property owned by the oregon department of transportation odot 
pge purchases any excess energy generated from this facility pursuant to a net metering arrangement with odot  installation completed in january  the second project has a total installed capacity of approximately mw and is located on the rooftops of three distribution warehouses in portland  oregon 
pge purchases of the energy generated from these facilities  and installation completed in july  the third project has a total installed capacity of approximately mw and is located on the rooftops of seven distribution warehouses in portland  oregon 
pge purchases of the energy generated from these facilities 
in september  pge entered into two year purchase agreements for the power to be generated from two solar photovoltaic projects to be installed near salem  oregon 
the construction of the projects is expected to be completed by mid  with pge then purchasing the power generated from these f acilities  which are designed to have a combined generating capacity of mw 
short term contracts these contracts are for delivery periods of one month up to one year in length 
they are entered into with various counterparties to provide additional firm energy to help meet the company s load requirement 
pge also utilizes spot purchases of power in the open market to secure the energy required to serve its retail customers 
such purchases are made under contracts that range i n duration from one hour to less than one month
