aggregates shipments in benefited from increased highway construction activity and some improvement in housing 
new home construction declined to historically low levels in then  after consecutive months of year over year declines  single family housing starts part ii 
table of contents began to improve in late by the end of  full year single family housing starts  as measured by mcgraw hill construction  had increased from and multi family housing starts increased 
tight credit has contributed to a sharp decrease in construction of nonresidential buildings  particularly stores and offices 
however  the rate of decline in private nonresidential construction began to slow late in construction activity funded by the public sector  typically less affected in economic cycles  increased in due mostly to the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra 
during the twelve months ended december  total contract awards for highway construction in vulcan served states  including awards for federal  state and local projects  increased from the prior year compared to a decrease of for other states 
the positive effects of arra spending in were somewhat offset by the failure of congress to reauthorize the most recent multi year federal transportation bill known as safetea lu  which expired on september  the federal transportation program was funded through a series of short term extensions in late and early passage of the hiring incentives to restore employment hire act in march included authorized funding for transportation programs through december  arra includes economic stimulus funding of to billion for heavy construction projects  including billion for highways and bridges 
vulcan served states were apportioned more funds than other states  with california  texas and florida receiving of the total for highways and bridges 
the challenge of meeting arra deadlines to ensure use of federal funds  coupled with the uncertainty surrounding the regular federal highway bill  led many states to slow the pace of obligating new projects funded by regular federal funding for highways during the first nine months of fiscal year ended september  during the last three months of the fiscal year  obligation of funds for projects was at record levels 
according to the federal highway administration  approximately billion or of the total stimulus funds apportioned for highways and bridges in vulcan served states remains to be spent 
the vast majority of this unspent amount  billion  is located in vulcan s top revenue producing states california  virginia  florida  texas  tennessee  georgia  illinois  north carolina  alabama and south carolina 
the pace of obligating  bidding  awarding and starting stimulus related highway construction projects has varied widely across states 
these state by state differences in awarding projects and spending patterns are due  in part  to the types of planned projects and to the proportion sub allocated to metropolitan planning organizations where project planning and execution can be more complicated and time consuming 
we have worked diligently throughout this downturn to position our company for earnings growth when demand recovers 
improved stability in the economic factors that drive demand for our products will bring the strength of our fundamentals back into focus 
vulcan preserved reasonably stable aggregates pricing during the worst year of demand maintained productivity levels despite slightly lower sales volumes controlled selling  administrative and general expenses as a result of these efforts  cash earnings for each ton of aggregates sold in was higher than at the peak of demand in part ii 
table of contents reconciliation of non gaap financial measures generally accepted accounting principles gaap does not define free cash flow and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
thus  they should not be considered as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities or any other liquidity or earnings measure defined by gaap 
we present these metrics for the convenience of investment professionals who use such metrics in their analysis  and for shareholders who need to understand the metrics we use to assess performance and to monitor our cash and liquidity positions 
the investment community often uses these metrics as indicators of a company s ability to incur and service debt 
we use free cash flow  ebitda and other such measures to assess the operating performance of our various business units and the consolidated company 
we do not use these metrics as a measure to allocate resources 
reconciliations of these metrics to their nearest gaap measures are presented below free cash flow free cash flow deducts purchases of property  plant equipment from net cash provided by operating activities

table of contents results of operations intersegment sales are internal sales between any of our four operating segments aggregates concrete asphalt mix cement intersegment sales consist of our aggregates and cement segments selling product to our concrete segment and our aggregates segment selling product to our asphalt mix segment 
we include intersegment sales in our comparative analysis of segment revenue at the product line level 
these intersegment sales are made at local market prices for the particular grade and quality of material required 
net sales and cost of goods sold exclude intersegment sales and delivery revenues and cost 
this presentation is consistent with the basis on which we review results of operations 
we discuss separately our discontinued operations  which consist of our former chemicals business

our aggregates shipments in were just over half the level shipped in when demand peaked 
we continued to manage our business to maximize cash generation 
in  we again reduced inventory levels of aggregates 
while this action negatively affected reported earnings  it increased cash generation and better positions us to increase production and earnings as demand recovers 
we also continued to reduce our overhead expenses 
cost associated with implementing some of these reductions increased selling  administrative and general expense in  however  the benefits of these overhead reductions should be realized in and beyond

table of contents the results include million of pretax charges related to the settlement of a lawsuit with the illinois department of transportation idot  a million pretax gain associated with the sale of non strategic assets in rural virginia and increased pretax costs of million related to higher unit costs for diesel fuel and liquid asphalt 
while we believed that the idot settlement was covered by insurance  we did not recognize its recovery as of december  due to uncertainty as to the amount and timing of a recovery 
however  in february we completed the first of two arbitrations in which two of our three insurers participated 
the arbitration panel awarded us a total of million in payment of their share of the settlement amount and attorneys fees 
this award will be recorded as income in the first quarter of the results include a million pretax goodwill impairment charge for our cement segment 
the results also include a million pretax gain from the sale of mining operations divested as a condition for approval of the florida rock acquisition by the department of justice

operating results by segment we present our results of operations by segment at the gross profit level

management reviews earnings for the product line segments principally at the gross profit level 
part ii 
table of contents aggregates our year over year aggregates shipments declined in in in to date  the economic recovery has not had a significant effect on some of our key end markets or key regional markets 
as a result  market conditions varied across our markets throughout the year 
aggregates shipments declined sharply in certain markets such as north carolina  florida and georgia  while shipments increased modestly in other markets such as south carolina  tennessee and texas 
our year over year aggregates selling price declined in improved in improved in since  our aggregates selling price has cumulatively increased 
the decline in aggregates selling price was due primarily to weakness in demand in florida and california 
in florida  demand remained relatively weak throughout the year while demand for aggregates in california exhibited some modest growth in the fourth quarter versus aggregates revenues and gross profits line graph aggregates unit shipments aggregates selling price customer and internal tons  in millions freight adjusted average sales price per ton line graph we continued tight management of our controllable plant operating costs to match weak demand

raw material costs were lower than and more than offset the effects of a decline in shipments 
concrete revenues and gross profits line graph asphalt mix our year over year asphalt mix shipments declined in in in asphalt mix segment earnings declined million from due mostly to a increase in the average unit cost for liquid asphalt 
higher liquid asphalt costs lowered segment earnings million in the average selling price for asphalt mix declined as selling prices for asphalt mix generally lag increasing liquid asphalt costs and were further held in check due to competitive pressures 
part ii 
table of contents asphalt mix revenues and gross profits line graph cement the average unit selling price for cement decreased  more than offsetting the earnings effect of a increase in unit sales volumes 
the increase in unit sales volumes was primarily attributable to an increase in intersegment sales 
cement revenues and gross profits line graph selling  administrative and general expenses additional costs associated with implementing some overhead expense reductions actually increased selling  administrative and general sag expenses for however  the benefits of these overhead reductions should be realized in and beyond 
on a comparable basis  sag costs in were million lower than benefits related to our project to replace legacy it systems began to be realized in  reducing project costs for the year 
we expect additional benefits from this project in the decline in sag cost was due primarily to reductions in employee related expenses which more than offset a year over year increase in project costs for the replacement of legacy it systems
