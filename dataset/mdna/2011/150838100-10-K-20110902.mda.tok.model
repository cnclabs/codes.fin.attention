item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations recent results and fiscal year end financial condition for the fiscal year ended june   total revenue increased  to million from million during fiscal freight revenue  which excludes revenue from fuel surcharges  increased  to million in fiscal from million in we generated net income of million  or per diluted share  for fiscal compared with net income of million  or per diluted share  for fiscal we believe that an improving economy and decreased industry wide trucking capacity in fiscal compared to fiscal were the major factors that contributed to our increase in net income 
increased revenue per loaded mile due to the rebounding economy caused an increase in average revenue per tractor per week 
as a result  average freight revenue per loaded mile excluding fuel surcharge for increased to compared with per mile in average freight revenue per tractor per week  our main measure of asset productivity  increased to  in compared with  for this increase was due to an increase in rates 
our operating margin  excluding the effect of fuel surcharge which is calculated as the percentage of operating expenses net of fuel surcharge over trucking revenue  improved to for compared with for at june   our total balance sheet debt was million and our total stockholders equity was million  for a total debt to capitalization ratio of 
at june   we had million of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility and million of cash on hand 
revenue we generate substantially all of our revenue by transporting freight for our customers 
generally  we are paid by the mile or by the load for our services 
we also derive revenue from fuel surcharges  loading and unloading activities  equipment detention  other trucking related services  and from warehousing services 
the main factors that affect our revenue are the revenue per mile we receive from our customers  the percentage of miles for which we are compensated  the number of tractors operating  and the number of miles we generate with our equipment 
these factors relate to  among other things  the us economy  inventory levels  the level of truck capacity in our markets  specific customer demand  the percentage of team driven tractors in our fleet  driver availability  and our average length of haul 
we eliminate fuel surcharges from revenue  when calculating operating ratios and some of our operating data 
we believe that eliminating the impact of this sometimes volatile source of revenue affords a more consistent basis for comparing our results of operations from period to period 
expenses and profitability the main factors that impact our profitability on the expense side are the variable costs of transporting freight for our customers 
these costs include fuel expense  driver related expenses  such as wages  benefits  training  and recruitment  and independent contractor costs  which we record as purchased transportation 
expenses that have both fixed and variable components include maintenance and tire expense and our total cost of insurance and claims 
these expenses generally vary with the miles we travel  but also have a controllable component based on safety  fleet age  efficiency  and other factors 
our main fixed cost is the acquisition and financing of long term assets  primarily revenue equipment 
we have other mostly fixed costs  such as our non driver personnel and facilities expenses 
in discussing our expenses as a percentage of revenue  we sometimes discuss changes as a percentage of revenue before fuel surcharges  in addition to absolute dollar changes  because we believe the high variable cost nature of our business makes a comparison of changes in expenses as a percentage of revenue more meaningful at times than absolute dollar changes 
the trucking industry has experienced significant increases in expenses over the past several years  in particular those relating to equipment costs  driver compensation  insurance  and fuel 
as the united states economy slowed down  many trucking companies were forced to lower freight rates to keep their trucks moving 
as the economy has started to improve  we are increasing rates as contracts expire or as the spot quote market allows 
over the long term  we expect a limited pool of qualified drivers and intense competition to recruit and retain those drivers to constrain overall industry capacity 
assuming a return to economic growth in us manufacturing  retail  and other high volume shipping industries  we expect to be able to raise freight rates in line with or faster than expenses 

table of contents revenue equipment we operate  tractors and  trailers 
of our tractors at june   were owned   were acquired under operating leases  and were provided by independent contractors  who own and drive their own tractors 
of our trailers at june    were owned   were acquired under operating leases and were acquired under capital leases 
we use a combination of cash and operating leases to acquire our new tractors 
most of our new trailers are acquired with operating leases 
these leases generally run for a period of three years for tractors and seven years for trailers 
when we finance revenue equipment acquisitions with operating leases  rather than borrowings or capital leases  the interest component of our financing activities is recorded as an above the line operating expense on our statements of operations 
independent contractors owner operators provide a tractor and a driver and are responsible for all operating expenses in exchange for a fixed payment per mile 
we do not have the capital outlay of purchasing the tractors 
the payments to independent contractors are recorded in purchased transportation and the payments for equipment under operating leases are recorded in revenue equipment rentals 
expenses associated with independent contractors  such as interest  depreciation  driver compensation  fuel  and other expenses are not incurred by the company 
because obtaining equipment from independent contractors and through operating leases effectively shifts these expenses from interest to above the line operating expenses  we evaluate our efficiency using our operating ratio as well as income before income taxes 
outlook looking forward  our profitability goal is to return our operating ratio to the low s in the near term and subsequently achieve an operating ratio of less than 
we expect this to require improvements in rate per mile and miles per tractor and decreased non revenue miles 
because a large percentage of our costs are variable  changes in revenue per mile affect our profitability to a greater extent than changes in miles per tractor 
for fiscal  the key factors that we expect to have the greatest effect on our profitability are our freight revenue per tractor per week which will be affected by the general freight environment  including the balance of freight demand and industry wide trucking capacity  our compensation of drivers  our cost of revenue equipment particularly in light of the epa engine requirements  our fuel costs  and our insurance and claims 
to overcome cost increases and improve our margins  we will need to achieve increases in freight revenue per tractor 
operationally  we will seek improvements in safety  driver recruiting  and retention 
our success in these areas primarily will affect revenue  driver related expenses  and insurance and claims expense 
given the slowly recovering economy  we believe achieving our near term profitability goal will be difficult to achieve 

table of contents results of operations the following tables set forth the percentage relationship of revenue and expense items to operating and freight revenue for the periods indicated 
fiscal year ended june  operating revenue operating expenses salaries  wages  and employee benefits fuel purchased transportation revenue equipment rentals operations and maintenance insurance and claims depreciation and amortization cost of products and services sold communication and utilities operating taxes and licenses general and other operating total operating expenses operating income other expense interest expense  net other expense income  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income freight revenue operating expenses salaries  wages  and employee benefits fuel purchased transportation revenue equipment rentals operations and maintenance insurance and claims depreciation and amortization cost of products and services sold communication and utilities operating taxes and licenses general and other operating total operating expenses operating income other expense interest expense  net other expense income  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income freight revenue is total operating revenue less fuel surcharges 
in this table  fuel surcharges are eliminated from revenue and subtracted from fuel expense 
the amounts were million  million  and million   and  respectively 

table of contents fiscal year ended june   compared with fiscal year ended june total revenue increased by million  or  to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal freight revenue increased by million  or  to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in freight rates  due to the slowly recovering economy and reduced capacity 
average freight revenue per total mile  excluding fuel surcharge  increased to in fiscal from for fiscal  or 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in billed miles to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal average freight revenue per seated tractor per week  excluding fuel surcharge  which is our primary measure of asset productivity  increased to  in fiscal  from  for fiscal  as a result of an increase in freight rates 
our freight rates improved throughout the fiscal year 
we expect our freight rates to maintain an upward trend through the end of the year as industry capacity continues to tighten 
fuel surcharge revenue increased to million from million for fiscal and  respectively 
revenue for our asset light segment increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  or 
warehousing  ltl  and brokerage revenues were up in fiscal tuckersbb decreased in fiscal as the subsidiary was sold into a joint venture in february therefore  truckersbb is recorded as minority interest in other income expense only for march through june  which does not reflect revenue or operating expenses in the consolidated statement of operations 
salaries  wages  and employee benefits were million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal  compared to million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal this decrease in salaries  wages  and benefits is largely due to decreased driver payroll related to decreased company driver miles  offset by increases in recruiting expense 
as the market for qualified drivers tightens  salaries  wages  and benefits may increase due to increases in driver pay 
however  the timing of any increase is uncertain 
fuel expenses  net of fuel surcharge revenue of million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively  decreased to million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal  compared to million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal these decreases were attributable to a decrease in gallons purchased due to decreased miles driven  offset by a increase in average fuel prices to per gallon for fiscal  from per gallon for fiscal we expect that our continued efforts to reduce idling  operate more fuel efficient tractors  and implement locking in fuel hedges when appropriate will continue to have a positive impact on our miles per gallon  however  we expect this positive impact to be partially offset by increasing fuel costs per gallon 
purchased transportation increased to million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal  from million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal the majority of these increases are related to increased miles and increased fuel surcharge paid to our independent contractor fleet as part of the independent contractor fixed payment 
the number of independent contractors increased to at june   compared with at june  independent contractors are drivers who cover all of their operating expenses fuel  driver salaries  maintenance  and equipment costs for a fixed payment per mile 
in addition  our brokerage and intermodal expenses are increasing year over year as we continue to develop and increase those offerings 
going forward  depending on outside factors such as the freight environment confronting our industry and the strength of the us economy  in general  we may decide to increase the number of independent contractors we engage 
accordingly  to the extent we increase the number of independent contractors in our fleet and continue to increase our purchased transportation for brokerage and intermodal transportation  we expect purchased transportation to increase as well 
revenue equipment rentals decreased to million  or of freight revenue  in fiscal  compared to million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal these decreases are related to a decreased number of leased tractors and an increase in lease rentals from our lease purchase program 
operations and maintenance consist of direct operating expense  maintenance  physical damage  and tire expense 
this category increased to million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal  from million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal the dollar increase in fiscal is related to an increase in costs associated with tractor maintenance from the new csa implementation and as tractors under warranty have declined  and tire expense increased 
we expect our operations and maintenance expense to be similar to the current level going forward  subject to implementation of csa that may impact these expenses 

table of contents insurance and claims expense increased to million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal  compared to million  or of freight revenue for fiscal insurance consists of premiums for liability  physical damage  cargo damage  and workers compensation insurance 
these increases are attributable to an increase in liability claims and cargo claims expense  due to an increase in the number and or severity of claims reported including loss development 
our insurance program involves self insurance at various risk retention levels 
claims in excess of these risk levels are covered by insurance in amounts we consider to be adequate 
we accrue for the uninsured portion of claims based on known claims and historical experience 
we continually review and revise our insurance program to maintain a balance between premium expense and the risk retention we are willing to assume 
we expect our insurance and claims expense to revert to more historical dollar averages going forward 
depreciation and amortization  consisting primarily of depreciation of revenue equipment  decreased to million  or of freight revenue  in fiscal from million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal these decreases are related to an increase in the gains recognized on the sale of equipment in fiscal compared to losses recognized on sales in fiscal these decreases are offset by an increase in the owned tractor depreciation 
revenue equipment held under operating leases is not reflected on our balance sheet and the expenses related to such equipment are reflected on our statements of operations in revenue equipment rentals  rather than in depreciation and amortization and interest expense  as is the case for revenue equipment that is financed with borrowings or capital leases 
all of our other expenses are relatively minor in amount  and there were no significant changes in these expenses 
accordingly  we have not provided a detailed discussion of such expenses 
our pretax margin  which we believe is a useful measure of our operating performance because it is neutral with regard to the method of revenue equipment financing that a company uses  increased basis points to of freight revenue for fiscal  from for fiscal income from the sale of a majority interest in a subsidiary was million in the third quarter of fiscal in february  we entered into a joint venture by selling of truckersbb to an unrelated third party 
in addition to other factors described above  canadian exchange rate fluctuations principally impact salaries  wages  and benefits and purchased transportation and  therefore  impact our pretax margin and results of operations 
the higher canadian dollar  which increased to an average 
relationship with the us dollar for fiscal  from an average 
relationship with the us dollar for fiscal  negatively impacted earnings per share by approximately 
income taxes increased to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal  resulting from a higher pre tax income 
due to the non deductible effects of our driver per diem pay structure  our tax rate will fluctuate from the standard federal rate  in future periods as net income fluctuates 
going forward  we expect our effective tax rate will be around to 
as a result of the factors described above  net income increased to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal fiscal year ended june   compared with fiscal year ended june total revenue increased by million  or  to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal freight revenue excludes million and million of fuel surcharge revenue for fiscal and  respectively 
freight revenue increased by million  or  to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in freight demand  due to the slowly recovering economy 
this increase was partially attributable to an increase in billed miles to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  and offset slightly by a decrease in average freight revenue per total mile  excluding fuel surcharge  to from 
average freight revenue per tractor per week  excluding 
table of contents fuel surcharge  which is our primary measure of asset productivity  increased to  in fiscal  from  for fiscal  as a result of increasing general freight demand  an increase in miles  partially offset by lower rates 
our freight rates began to improve at the end of the third quarter and continued to improve throughout the fourth quarter 
we expect our freight rates to maintain an upward trend through the end of the year as industry capacity continues to tighten 
revenue for truckersbb remained unchanged at million in fiscal and fiscal revenue was flat as truckersbb continues to operate in a challenging environment as smaller fleets have been forced out of business by the economy and difficult operating conditions and many of those remaining have cut back on purchases 
to the extent small and mid size carriers continue to be affected adversely by the weakened economy  lagging freight demand  limited financing availability  and licensing  insurance  and other costs  we anticipate the revenue for truckersbb to be negatively impacted as well 
salaries  wages  and employee benefits were million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal  compared to million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal this slight dollar increase in salaries  wages  and benefits is largely due to increased driver payroll related to increased miles and increases in stock appreciation rights expenses as the stock price has increased 
these were offset by a reduction in administrative payroll  due to the efforts in the latter part of fiscal to eliminate or consolidate several functions  therefore reducing payroll expense 
also offsetting this increase was a reduction in driver pay per mile and a reduction in our driver recruiting costs in fiscal as compared to fiscal however  the increased freight revenue resulted in a decrease in salaries  wages  and employee benefits as a percentage of freight revenue 
fuel expenses  net of fuel surcharge revenue of million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively  increased to million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal  compared to million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal these increases were attributable to an increase in gallons purchased due to increased miles driven  offset by a decrease in average fuel prices to per gallon for fiscal  from per gallon for fiscal we expect that our continued efforts to reduce idling and operate more fuel efficient tractors will continue to have a positive impact on our miles per gallon  however  we expect this will be partially offset by lower fuel economy on epa mandated new engines 
purchased transportation increased to million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal  from million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal the majority of these increases are related to increased miles by our independent contractor fleet 
the number of independent contractors increased to at june   compared with at june  independent contractors are drivers who cover all their operating expenses fuel  driver salaries  maintenance  and equipment costs for a fixed payment per mile 
in addition  our brokerage and intermodal expenses are increasing year over year as we continue to develop and increase those offerings 
going forward  depending on outside factors such as the freight environment confronting our industry and the strength of the us economy  in general  we may decide to increase the number of independent contractors we engage 
accordingly  to the extent we increase the number of independent contractors in our fleet and continue to increase our purchased transportation for brokerage and intermodal transportation  we expect purchased transportation to increase as well 
revenue equipment rentals increased to million  or of freight revenue  in fiscal  compared to million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal the majority of these increases are related to an increased number of leased tractors which is partially offset by increased lease rentals from our lease purchase program 
operations and maintenance consist of direct operating expense  maintenance  physical damage  and tire expense 
this category increased to million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal  from million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal the dollar increase in fiscal is primarily related to an increase in costs associated with tire and physical damage expenses 
however  these factors were offset by a decrease in tractor maintenance and miscellaneous direct operating expenses 
insurance and claims expense increased to million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal  compared to million  or of freight revenue for fiscal insurance consists of premiums for liability  physical damage  cargo damage  and workers compensation insurance 
this increase is attributable to an increase in workers compensation claims  liability claims  and cargo claims expense  due to an increase in the number and or severity of claims reported including loss development 
our insurance program involves self insurance at various 
table of contents risk retention levels 
claims in excess of these risk levels are covered by insurance in amounts we consider to be adequate 
we accrue for the uninsured portion of claims based on known claims and historical experience 
we continually review and revise our insurance program to maintain a balance between premium expense and the risk retention we are willing to assume 
we expect our insurance and claims expense to revert to more historical averages going forward 
depreciation and amortization  consisting primarily of depreciation of revenue equipment  decreased to million  or of freight revenue  in fiscal from million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal these decreases are related to a decrease in the number of owned tractors 
these decreases are partially offset by a slight increase in losses on sales of equipment in fiscal compared to fiscal to the extent the used equipment market remains weak going forward  we expect to face difficulty selling equipment in quantities and at prices that are satisfactory to us 
revenue equipment held under operating leases is not reflected on our balance sheet and the expenses related to such equipment are reflected on our statements of operations in revenue equipment rentals  rather than in depreciation and amortization and interest expense  as is the case for revenue equipment that is financed with borrowings or capital leases 
all of our other expenses are relatively minor in amount  and there were no significant changes in these expenses 
accordingly  we have not provided a detailed discussion of such expenses 
our pretax margin  which we believe is a useful measure of our operating performance because it is neutral with regard to the method of revenue equipment financing that a company uses  increased basis points to of freight revenue for fiscal  from for fiscal in addition to other factors described above  canadian exchange rate fluctuations principally impact salaries  wages  and benefits and purchased transportation and  therefore  impact our pretax margin and results of operations 
the higher canadian dollar  which increased to an average 
relationship with the us dollar for fiscal  from an average 
relationship with the us dollar for fiscal  negatively impacted earnings per share by approximately 
income taxes increased to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal  resulting from a higher pre tax income 
due to the non deductible effects of our driver per diem pay structure  our tax rate will fluctuate from the standard federal rate  in future periods as net income fluctuates 
going forward  we expect our effective tax rate will be around to 
income tax expense for fiscal included an adjustment of approximately  related to per diem calculations for prior years 
as a result of the factors described above  net income increased to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal liquidity and capital resources trucking is a capital intensive business 
we require cash to fund our operating expenses other than depreciation and amortization  to make capital expenditures and acquisitions  and to repay debt  including principal and interest payments 
other than ordinary operating expenses  we anticipate that capital expenditures for the acquisition of revenue equipment will constitute our primary cash requirement over the next twelve months 
we frequently consider potential acquisitions  and if we were to consummate an acquisition  our cash requirements would increase and we may have to modify our expected financing sources for the purchase of tractors 
subject to any required lender approval  we may make acquisitions  although we do not have any specific acquisition plans at this time 
our principal sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations  bank borrowings  capital and operating lease financing of revenue equipment  and proceeds from the sale of used revenue equipment 
at june   our total balance sheet debt  including capital lease obligations and current maturities  was million  compared to million at june  as of june   we had on order tractors for delivery through fiscal we also had on order trailers for delivery through fiscal these revenue equipment orders represent a capital commitment of approximately million  before considering the proceeds of equipment dispositions 
in fiscal  we expect to purchase our new tractors with both cash and off balance sheet operating leases and our new trailers with off balance sheet operating leases 

table of contents we believe we will be able to fund our operating expenses  as well as our current commitments for the acquisition of revenue equipment  over the next twelve months with a combination of cash generated from operations  borrowings available under secured equipment financing or our primary credit facility  equipment sales  and lease financing arrangements 
we will continue to have significant capital requirements over the long term  and the availability of the needed capital will depend upon our financial condition and operating results and numerous other factors over which we have limited or no control  including prevailing market conditions and the market price of our common stock 
however  based on our operating results  anticipated future cash flows  current availability under our credit facility  and sources of equipment lease financing that we expect will be available to us  we do not expect to experience significant liquidity constraints in the foreseeable future 
cash flows we generated net cash from operating activities of million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal the decrease in net cash provided by operations in fiscal from fiscal is due primarily to an increase in net income and trade receivables  prepaid expenses and other current assets  and tires in service  and a decrease in income taxes payable 
net cash used in investing activities was million for fiscal  million for fiscal  and million for fiscal the decrease in cash used for investing activities from to was primarily due to increased proceeds from sale of equipment 
capital expenditures primarily for tractors and trailers including lease buyouts and new equipment purchases totaled million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal we generated proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal net cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal the increase in cash used for financing activities was primarily due to the increased payments on our capital leases 
financing activity represents bank borrowings new borrowings  net of repayments and payment of the principal component of capital lease obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements operating leases have been an important source of financing for our revenue equipment 
our operating leases include some under which we do not guarantee the value of the asset at the end of the lease term walk away leases and some under which we do guarantee the value of the asset at the end of the lease term residual value 
therefore  we are subject to the risk that equipment value may decline in which case we would suffer a loss upon disposition and be required to make cash payments because of the residual value guarantees 
we were obligated for residual value guarantees related to operating leases of million at june  compared to million at june  a small portion of these amounts is covered by repurchase and or trade agreements we have with the equipment manufacturer 
we believe that any residual payment obligations that are not covered by the manufacturer will be satisfied  in the aggregate  by the value of the related equipment at the end of the lease 
to the extent the expected value at the lease termination date is lower than the residual value guarantee  we would accrue for the difference over the remaining lease term 
we anticipate that going forward we will use a combination of operating leases and cash generated from operations to finance tractor purchases and operating leases to finance trailer purchases 
the use of operating leases also affects our statement of cash flows 
for assets subject to these operating leases  we do not record depreciation as an increase to net cash provided by operations  nor do we record any entry with respect to investing activities or financing activities 
primary credit agreement on december   the company entered into a new million five year revolving credit facility agented by bank of america  na the facility refinanced the company existing credit facility and provides for ongoing working capital needs and general corporate purposes 
bank of america  na served as the lead arranger in the facility and wells fargo bank  na also participated in the new facility 
at june   we were authorized to borrow up to million under this revolving line of credit  which expires december  the applicable interest rate under this agreement is based on either a base rate equal to the greater of the bank of america  na prime rate or libor plus an applicable margin between and that is adjusted quarterly based on the company lease adjusted total debt to ebitdar ratio 
at june   we had no outstanding borrowings related to our credit facility and million utilized for letters of credit 
we are obligated to comply with certain financial covenants under our credit agreement and we were in compliance with these covenants at june  
table of contents contractual obligations and commitments as of june   our bank loans  capitalized leases  operating leases  other debts  and future commitments have stated maturities or minimum annual payments as follows cash requirements as of june  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years operating leases lease residual value guarantees capital lease obligations long term debt sub total future purchase of revenue equipment employment and consulting agreements standby letters of credit total contractual and cash obligations includes interest 
the amounts reflected in the table do not include amounts that could become payable to our chief executive officer and president and chief operating officer  under certain circumstances if their employment by the company is terminated 
inflation  new emissions control regulations  and fuel costs most of our operating expenses are inflation sensitive  with inflation generally producing increased costs of operations 
during the past three years  the most significant effects of inflation have been on revenue equipment prices and fuel prices 
new emissions control regulations and increases in commodity prices  wages of manufacturing workers  and other items have resulted in higher tractor prices 
we attempt to limit the effects of inflation through increases in freight rates  certain cost control efforts  and limiting the effects of fuel prices through fuel surcharges 
the engines used in our tractors are subject to emissions control regulations  which have substantially increased our operating expenses since additional and more stringent regulation began in as of june   our tractor fleet has engines compliant with stricter regulations regarding emissions that became effective in compliance with such regulations is expected to increase the cost of new tractors and could impair equipment productivity  lower fuel mileage  and increase our operating expenses 
these adverse effects combined with the uncertainty as to the reliability of the vehicles equipped with the newly designed diesel engines and the residual values that will be realized from the disposition of these vehicles could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business or operations as the regulations impact our business through new tractor purchases 

table of contents fluctuations in the price or availability of fuel  as well as hedging activities  surcharge collection  the percentage of freight we obtain through brokers  and the volume and terms of diesel fuel purchase commitments may increase our costs of operation  which could materially and adversely affect our profitability 
we impose fuel surcharges on substantially all accounts 
these arrangements may not fully protect us from fuel price increases and also may result in us not receiving the full benefit of any fuel price decreases 
as of june   we had up to of our estimated fuel purchases hedged through september with the use of these hedges and any additional future hedges  we may be forced to make cash payments under the hedging arrangements 
based on current market conditions  we have decided to limit our hedging and purchase commitments  but we continue to evaluate such measures 
the absence of meaningful fuel price protection through these measures could adversely affect our profitability and results of operation 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that impact the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
therefore  the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and associated disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities are affected by these estimates and assumptions 
we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis  utilizing historical experience  consultation with experts  and other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances 
nevertheless  actual results may differ significantly from our estimates and assumptions  and it is possible that materially different amounts would be reported using differing estimates or assumptions 
we consider our critical accounting policies to be those that require us to make more significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our financial statements 
our critical accounting policies include the following depreciation of property and equipment 
we depreciate our property and equipment using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the asset 
we generally use estimated useful lives of to years for new tractors and trailers  and estimated salvage values for new tractors and trailers generally range from to of the capitalized cost 
gains and losses on the disposal of revenue equipment are included in depreciation expense in our statements of operations 
we review the reasonableness of our estimates regarding useful lives and salvage values of our revenue equipment and other long lived assets based upon  among other things  our experience with similar assets  conditions in the used equipment market  and prevailing industry practice 
changes in our useful life or salvage value estimates or fluctuations in market values that are not reflected in our estimates  could have a material effect on our results of operations 
revenue equipment and other long lived assets are tested for impairment whenever an event occurs that indicates an impairment may exist 
expected future cash flows are used to analyze whether an impairment has occurred 
if the sum of expected undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the long lived asset  then an impairment loss is recognized 
we measure the impairment loss by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value 
fair value is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis or the appraised or estimated market value of the asset  as appropriate 
operating leases 
we have financed a substantial percentage of our tractors and trailers with operating leases 
these leases generally contain residual value guarantees  which provide that the value of equipment returned to the lessor at the end of the lease term will be no lower than a negotiated amount 
to the extent that the value of the equipment is below the negotiated amount  we are liable to the lessor for the shortage at the expiration of the lease 
for all equipment  we are required to recognize additional rental expense to the extent we believe the fair market value at the lease termination will be less than our obligation to the lessor 
in accordance with accounting standards codification asc topic  accounting for leases  property and equipment held under operating leases  and liabilities related thereto  are not reflected on our balance sheet 
all expenses related to revenue equipment operating leases are reflected on our statements of operations in the line item entitled revenue equipment rentals 
as such  financing revenue equipment with operating leases instead of bank borrowings or capital leases effectively moves the interest component of the financing arrangement into operating expenses on our statements of operations 

table of contents claims reserves and estimates 
the primary claims arising for us consist of cargo liability  personal injury  property damage  collision and comprehensive  workers compensation  and employee medical expenses 
we maintain self insurance levels for these various areas of risk and have established reserves to cover these self insured liabilities 
we also maintain insurance to cover liabilities in excess of these self insurance amounts 
claims reserves represent accruals for the estimated uninsured portion of reported claims  including adverse development of reported claims  as well as estimates of incurred but not reported claims 
reported claims and related loss reserves are estimated by third party administrators  and we refer to these estimates in establishing our reserves 
claims incurred but not reported are estimated based on our historical experience and industry trends  which are continually monitored  and accruals are adjusted when warranted by changes in facts and circumstances 
in establishing our reserves we must take into account and estimate various factors  including  but not limited to  assumptions concerning the nature and severity of the claim  the effect of the jurisdiction on any award or settlement  the length of time until ultimate resolution  inflation rates in health care  and in general interest rates  legal expenses  and other factors 
our actual experience may be different than our estimates  sometimes significantly 
changes in assumptions as well as changes in actual experience could cause these estimates to change in the near term 
insurance and claims expense will vary from period to period based on the severity and frequency of claims incurred in a given period 
derivative instruments and hedging activity 
we use derivative financial instruments to manage the economic impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates and fuel prices 
derivative financial instruments related to currency exchange rates and heating oil fuel prices include forward purchase and sale agreements which generally have terms no greater than months 
to account for our derivative financial instruments  we follow the provisions of asc topic  derivatives and hedging 
derivative financial instruments are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in earnings or accumulated other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is designated and effective as part of a hedge transaction  and if it is  the type of hedge transaction 
gains and losses on derivative instruments reported in accumulated other comprehensive income are subsequently included in earnings in the periods in which earnings are affected by the hedged item 
these activities have not had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations for the periods presented herein 
accounting for income taxes 
deferred income taxes represent a substantial liability on our consolidated balance sheet 
deferred income taxes are determined in accordance with asc topic income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
we evaluate our tax assets and liabilities on a periodic basis and adjust these balances as appropriate 
we believe that we have adequately provided for our future tax consequences based upon current facts and circumstances and current tax law 
however  should our tax positions be challenged and not prevail  different outcomes could result and have a significant impact on the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
the carrying value of our deferred tax assets tax benefits expected to be realized in the future assumes that we will be able to generate  based on certain estimates and assumptions  sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions to utilize these deferred tax benefits 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to reduce the value of the deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense 
we believe that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets  net of valuation allowance  will be realized  based on forecasted income 
however  there can be no assurance that we will meet our forecasts of future income

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements on december   the fasb issued asu  which does not prescribe a specific method of calculating the carrying value of a reporting unit in the performance of step of the goodwill impairment test and requires entities with a zero or negative carrying value to assess  considering qualitative factors such as those listed in asc these factors are not all inclusive  whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists confirming this aspect of the consensus for exposure 
if an entity concludes that it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists  the entity must perform step of the goodwill impairment test 
this asu is effective for impairment tests performed during entities fiscal years and interim periods within those years that begin after december  early application is not permitted 
it is not expected that adoption of asu will have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
on july   the fasb issued asu  which amends asc by requiring more robust and disaggregated disclosures about the credit quality of an entity s financing receivables and its allowance for credit losses 
the purpose of the additional disclosures is to improve financial statement users understanding of the nature of an entity s credit risk associated with its financing receivables and the entity s assessment of that risk in estimating its allowance for credit losses as well as changes in the allowance and the reasons for those changes 
the new and amended disclosures that relate to information as of the end of a reporting period will be effective for the first time including interim periods on or after december  most of the new and amended disclosures in the asu became effective at year end however  the disclosures that include information for activity that occurs during a reporting period will be effective for the first time including interim periods beginning after december  those disclosures include the activity in the allowance for credit losses for each period and disclosures about modifications of financing receivables 
these disclosures will be effective for the first quarter of and are not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in december  fasb issued asu this accounting standards update amends fasb accounting standards codification asc of fasb statement no 
 amendments to fasb interpretation no 
r issued june the amendments in this accounting standards update replace the quantitative based risks and rewards calculation for determining which reporting entity  if any  has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity with an approach focused on identifying which reporting entity has the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity 
an approach that is expected to be primarily qualitative will be more effective for identifying which reporting entity has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity 
the amendments in this update also require additional disclosures about a reporting entity involvement in variable interest entities  which will enhance the information provided to readers of financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we experience various market risks  including changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and fuel prices 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes  nor when there are no underlying related exposures 
interest rate risk 
we are exposed to interest rate risk principally from our primary credit facility 
the credit facility carries a maximum variable interest rate based on either a base rate equal to the greater of the bank of america  na prime rate or libor plus an applicable margin between and that is adjusted quarterly based on the company lease adjusted total debt to ebitdar ratio 
at june   we did not have any variable rate term loan borrowings outstanding under the credit facility 
a hypothetical increase in the bank base rate and libor would be immaterial to our net income 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk  specifically in connection with our canadian operations 
while virtually all of the expenses associated with our canadian operations  such as independent contractor costs  company driver compensation  and administrative costs  are paid in canadian dollars  a significant portion of our revenue generated from those operations is billed in us dollars because many of our customers are us shippers transporting goods to or from canada 
as a result  increases in the canadian dollar exchange rate adversely affect the profitability of our canadian operations 
assuming revenue and expenses for our canadian operations identical to the year ended june  both in terms of amount and currency mix  we estimate that a increase in the canadian dollar exchange rate would reduce our annual net income by approximately  we currently have contracts for million canadian dollars through august 
table of contents while virtually all of the expenses associated with our mexican operations  such as independent contractor costs  company driver compensation  and administrative costs  are paid in mexican pesos  a significant portion of our revenue generated from those operations is billed in us dollars because many of our customers are us shippers transporting goods to or from mexico 
as a result  a decrease in the value of the mexican peso could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 
assuming revenue and expenses for our mexican operations identical to the year ended june  both in terms of amount and currency mix  we estimate that a decrease in the mexican peso exchange rate would reduce our annual net income by approximately  we currently have contracts for million mexican pesos per month through may  representing approximately of our mexican currency exposure 
derivative gains losses  initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income  are reclassified to earnings in the period when the forecasted transaction affects earnings 
commodity price risk 
shortages of fuel  increases in prices  or rationing of petroleum products can have a materially adverse effect on our operations and profitability 
fuel is subject to economic  political  and market factors that are outside of our control 
historically  we have sought to recover a portion of short term increases in fuel prices from customers through the collection of fuel surcharges 
however  fuel surcharges do not always fully offset increases in fuel prices 
in addition  from time to time we may enter into derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations 
as of june   we had up to of our estimated fuel purchases hedged through september based on our expected fuel consumption for  a change in the related price of heating oil or diesel per gallon would not have a material financial impact  assuming no further changes to our fuel hedging program or our fuel surcharge recovery
