table of contents our raw materials the manufacturing of pulp and paper requires wood fiber  chemicals and energy 
we discuss these three major raw materials used in our manufacturing operations  below 
wood fiber united states pulp and paper mills the fiber used by our pulp and paper mills in the united states is primarily hardwood and secondarily softwood  both being readily available in the market from multiple third party sources 
the mills obtain fiber from a variety of sources  depending on their location 
these sources include a combination of long term supply contracts  wood lot management arrangements  advance stumpage purchases and spot market purchases 
canadian pulp and paper mills the fiber used at our windsor pulp and paper mill is hardwood originating from a variety of sources  including purchases on the open market in canada and the united states  contracts with quebec wood producers marketing boards  public land where we have wood supply allocations and from domtar s private lands 
the softwood and hardwood for our espanola pulp and paper mill  and the softwood fiber for our dryden pulp mill is obtained from third parties  directly or indirectly from public lands  through designated wood supply allocations for the pulp mills or from business to business arrangements from the ontario sawmills sold to eacom timber corporation 
the fiber used at our kamloops pulp mill is all softwood  originating mostly from third party sawmilling operations in the southern interior part of british columbia 
cutting rights on public lands related to our pulp and paper mills in canada represent about million cubic meters of softwood and million cubic meters of hardwood  for a total of million cubic meters of wood per year 
access to harvesting of fiber on public lands in ontario and quebec is subject to licenses and review by the respective governmental authorities 
during  the cost of wood fiber relating to our papers segment comprised approximately of the total cost of sales 
chemicals we use various chemical compounds in our pulp and paper manufacturing facilities that we purchase  primarily on a central basis  through contracts varying between one and twelve years in length to ensure product availability 
most of the contracts have pricing that fluctuates based on prevailing market conditions 
for pulp manufacturing  we use numerous chemicals including caustic soda  sodium chlorate  sulfuric acid  lime and peroxide 
for paper manufacturing  we also use several chemical products including starch  precipitated calcium carbonate  optical brighteners  dyes and aluminum sulfate 
during  the cost of chemicals relating to our papers segment comprised approximately of the total cost of sales 
energy our operations consume substantial amounts of fuel including natural gas  fuel oil  coal and biomass  as well as electricity 
we purchase substantial portions of the fuel we consume under supply contracts 
under most of these contracts  suppliers are committed to provide quantities within pre determined ranges that provide us with our needs for a particular type of fuel at a specific facility 
most of these contracts have pricing that fluctuates based on prevailing market conditions 
natural gas  fuel oil  coal and biomass are consumed primarily to produce steam that is used in the manufacturing process and  to a lesser extent  to provide direct heat to be used in the chemical recovery process 
about of the total energy required to manufacture our products comes from renewable fuels such as bark and spent cooking liquor 
the remainder of the energy comes from purchased fossil fuels such as natural gas  oil and coal 

table of contents we own power generating assets  including steam turbines  at all of our integrated pulp and paper mills  as well as hydro assets at four locations espanola  our former ottawa hull site  nekoosa and rothschild

this leading market position provides us with key competitive advantages  including economies of scale  wider sales and marketing coverage and a broad product offering of business  printing and publishing and converting and specialty paper grades 
efficient and cost competitive assets 
our network of world class assets allows us to be a low cost producer of high volume papers and an efficient producer of value added specialty papers 
our five largest mills focus on the production of high volume copy and offset papers while production at our other mills focuses on value added paper products where quality  flexibility and service are key factors 
most of our paper is produced at mills with integrated pulp production and cogeneration facilities  reducing our exposure to price volatility for purchased pulp and energy 
proximity to customers 
we have a broad manufacturing footprint supported by a network of converting and distribution operations located across north america 
this proximity to customers provides opportunities for direct and enhanced customer service and minimizes freight distances  response time and delivery cost 
these constitute key competitive advantages  particularly in the high volume copy and offset paper grades market segment 
customer proximity also allows for just in time delivery of high demand paper products in less than hours to most major north american markets 
strong franchise with customer focused solutions 
we sell paper to multiple market segments through a variety of channels  including paper merchants  converters  retail companies and publishers throughout north america 
in addition  we maintain a strong market presence through our ownership of ariva

we are building on the successful relationships that we have developed with key customers to support their businesses and to provide inventory reduction solutions through just in time delivery for the most demanded products 
we believe that we are a supplier of choice for customers who seek competitively priced pulp and paper products and services 

table of contents focus on generating free cash flow and maintaining financial discipline 
we believe efficiently operated assets and carefully managed manufacturing costs are key to creating shareholder value 
to generate free cash flow  we are focused on assigning our capital expenditures effectively and minimizing working capital requirements by reducing discretionary spending  reviewing procurement costs and pursuing the balancing of production and inventory control 
leverage our expertise to tap into growth opportunities 
in order to sustain the success of our company  we believe that we must leverage our core competencies and expertise as operators of large scale operations and our expertise in the manufacture of fiber based products and fiber sourcing 
we are focused on optimizing and expanding our operations in markets with positive demand dynamics to help grow our business and counteract secular demand decline in our core north american fine paper business 
operate in a responsible way 
customers  end users  and all stakeholders in communities where we operate seek assurances from the pulp and paper industry that resources are managed in a sustainable manner 
we strive to provide these assurances by certifying our manufacturing and distribution operations  namely with fsc chain of custody standards  and we intend to have our environmental management systems third party verified against internationally recognized standards 
continue to grow our line of environmentally and ethically responsible papers 
we believe we are delivering improved service to customers through a broad range of product offerings and greater access to volume 
the development of earthchoice  our line of environmentally and socially responsible paper  is providing a platform upon which to expand our offering to customers 
the earthchoice line of papers  a product line supported by leading environmental groups  offers customers solutions and peace of mind through the use of a combination of fsc virgin fiber and recycled fiber 
fsc is the certification recognized by environmental groups as the most stringent and is third party audited 
our competition the markets in which our businesses operate are highly competitive with well established domestic and foreign manufacturers 
in the paper business  our paper production does not rely on proprietary processes or formulas  except in highly specialized papers or customized products 
in order to gain market share in uncoated freesheet  we compete primarily on the basis of product quality  breadth of offering  service solutions and competitively priced paper products 
we seek product differentiation through an extensive offering of high quality fsc certified paper products 
while we have a leading position in the north american uncoated freesheet market  we also compete with other paper grades  including coated freesheet  and with electronic transmission and document storage alternatives 
as the use of these alternative products continues to grow  we continue to see a decrease in the overall demand for paper products or shifts from one type of paper to another 
all of our pulp and paper manufacturing facilities are located in the united states or in canada where we sell of our products 
the five largest manufacturers of uncoated freesheet papers in north america represent approximately of the total production capacity 
on a global basis  there are hundreds of manufacturers that produce and sell uncoated freesheet papers  eight of which have annual production capacities of over million tons 
the level of competitive pressures from foreign producers in the north american market is highly dependent upon exchange rates  including the rate between the us dollar and the euro as well as the us dollar and the brazilian real 
the market pulp we sell is either softwood  fluff pulp  or hardwood 
the pulp market is highly fragmented with many manufacturers competing worldwide  some of whom have lower operating costs than we do 
competition is primarily on the basis of access to low cost wood fiber  product quality and competitively priced pulp products 
the pulp we sell is primarily slow growth northern bleached softwood and hardwood kraft  and we produce specialty engineered pulp grades with a pre determined mix of wood species 
our pulps are sold to a combination of paper grade customers who make printing and writing grades  and non paper grade 
table of contents customers who make a variety of products for specialty paper  packaging  tissue and industrial applications 
we also seek product differentiation through the certification of our pulp mills to the fsc chain of custody standard and the procurement of fsc certified virgin fiber 
all of our market pulp production capacity is located in the united states or in canada  and we sell of our pulp to other countries 
our employees we have over  employees  of which approximately are employed in the united states and in canada 
approximately of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements  generally on a facility by facility basis  certain of which expired in and some will expire between and in  we signed a four year umbrella agreement with the united steelworkers union  affecting approximately  employees at our us locations 
this agreement only covers certain economic elements  and all other contract issues will be negotiated at each operating location  as the related collective bargaining agreements become subject to renewal 
the parties have agreed not to strike or lock out during the terms of the respective local agreements 
our approach to sustainability we adopted our statement on sustainable growth to govern our pathway to sustainability  from excellence in corporate and ethical standards to product stewardship 
consistently with our statement  we define our actions under our code of ethics  policies addressing health and safety  environment  forestry fiber procurement and others 
our environmental challenges our business is subject to a wide range of general and industry specific laws and regulations in the united states and canada relating to the protection of the environment  including those governing harvesting  air emissions  climate change  waste water discharges  the storage  management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes  contaminated sites  landfill operation and closure obligations and health and safety matters 
compliance with these laws and regulations is a significant factor in the operation of our business 
we may encounter situations in which our operations fail to maintain full compliance with applicable environmental requirements  possibly leading to civil or criminal fines  penalties or enforcement actions  including those that could result in governmental or judicial orders that stop or interrupt our operations or require us to take corrective measures at substantial costs  such as the installation of additional pollution control equipment or other remedial actions 
compliance with us federal  state and local and canadian federal and provincial environmental laws and regulations involves capital expenditures as well as additional operating costs 
for example  the united states environmental protection agency will be promulgating regulations addressing the emissions of hazardous air pollutants from all industrial boilers  including those present at pulp and paper mills  which will require the use of maximum achievable control technology

item a 
risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other information presented in this annual report on form k 
risks relating to the industry and businesses of the company some of the company s products are vulnerable to long term declines in demand due to competing technologies or materials 
the company s business competes with electronic transmission and document storage alternatives  as well as with paper grades it does not produce  such as uncoated groundwood 
as a result of such competition  the company is experiencing on going decreasing demand for most of its existing paper products 
as the use of these alternatives grows  demand for paper products is likely to further decline 
failure to successfully implement our business diversification initiatives could have a material adverse affect on our business  financial results or condition we are pursuing strategic initiatives that management considers important to our long term success including  but not limited to  optimizing and expanding our operations in markets with positive demand dynamics to help grow our business and counteract secular demand decline in our core north american paper business 
these initiatives may involve organic growth  select joint ventures and strategic acquisitions 
the success of these initiatives will depend  among other things  on our ability to identify potential strategic initiatives  understand the key trends and principal drivers affecting businesses to be acquired and to execute the initiatives in a cost effective manner 
there are significant risks involved with the execution of these initiatives  including significant business  economic and competitive uncertainties  many of which are outside of our control 
strategic acquisitions may expose us to additional risks 
we may have to compete for acquisition targets and any acquisitions we make may fail to accomplish our strategic objectives or may not perform as expected 
in addition  the costs of integrating an acquired business may exceed our estimates and may take significant time and attention from senior management 
accordingly  we cannot predict whether we will succeed in implementing these strategic initiatives 
if we fail to successfully diversify our business  it may have a material adverse effect on our competitive position  financial condition and operating results 

table of contents the pulp and paper industry is highly cyclical 
fluctuations in the prices of and the demand for the company s products could result in lower sales volumes and smaller profit margins 
the pulp and paper industry is highly cyclical 
historically  economic and market shifts  fluctuations in capacity and changes in foreign currency exchange rates have created cyclical changes in prices  sales volume and margins for the company s products 
the length and magnitude of industry cycles have varied over time and by product  but generally reflect changes in macroeconomic conditions and levels of industry capacity 
most of the company s paper products are commodities that are widely available from other producers 
even the company s non commodity products  such as value added papers  are susceptible to commodity dynamics 
because commodity products have few distinguishing qualities from producer to producer  competition for these products is based primarily on price  which is determined by supply relative to demand 
the overall levels of demand for the products the company manufactures and distributes  and consequently its sales and profitability  reflect fluctuations in levels of end user demand  which depend in part on general macroeconomic conditions in north america and worldwide  as well as competition from electronic substitution 
see conditions in the global capital and credit markets  and the economy generally  can adversely affect the company business  results of operations and financial position and some of the company s products are vulnerable to long term declines in demand due to competing technologies or materials 
for example  demand for cut size office paper may fluctuate with levels of white collar employment 
industry supply of pulp and paper products is also subject to fluctuation  as changing industry conditions can influence producers to idle or permanently close individual machines or entire mills 
such closures can result in significant cash and or non cash charges 
in addition  to avoid substantial cash costs in connection with idling or closing a mill  some producers will choose to continue to operate at a loss  sometimes even a cash loss  which could prolong weak pricing environments due to oversupply 
oversupply can also result from producers introducing new capacity in response to favorable short term pricing trends 
industry supply of pulp and paper products is also influenced by overseas production capacity  which has grown in recent years and is expected to continue to grow 
as a result  prices for all of the company s products are driven by many factors outside of its control  and the company has little influence over the timing and extent of price changes  which are often volatile 
because market conditions beyond the company s control determine the prices for its commodity products  the price for any one or more of these products may fall below its cash production costs  requiring the company to either incur cash losses on product sales or cease production at one or more of its manufacturing facilities 
the company continuously evaluates potential adjustments to its production capacity  which may include additional closures of machines or entire mills  and the company could recognize significant cash and or non cash charges relating to any such closures in future periods 
see part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  under restructuring activities 
therefore  the company s profitability with respect to these products depends on managing its cost structure  particularly wood fiber  chemical and energy costs  which represent the largest components of its operating costs and can fluctuate based upon factors beyond its control  as described below 
if the prices of or demand for its products decline  or if its wood fiber  chemical or energy costs increase  or both  its sales and profitability could be materially and adversely affected 
conditions in the global capital and credit markets  and the economy generally  can adversely affect the company business  results of operations and financial position 
a significant or prolonged downturn in general economic condition may affect the company s sales and profitability 
the company has exposure to counterparties with which we routinely execute transactions 
such counterparties include commercial banks  insurance companies and other financial institutions  some of which may be exposed to bankruptcy or liquidity risks 
while the company has not realized any significant losses to date  a bankruptcy or illiquidity event by one of its significant counterparties may materially and adversely affect the company s access to capital  future business and results of operations 

table of contents the company faces intense competition in its markets  and the failure to compete effectively would have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations 
the company competes with both us and canadian producers and  for many of its product lines  global producers  some of which may have greater financial resources and lower production costs than the company 
the principal basis for competition is selling price 
the company s ability to maintain satisfactory margins depends in large part on its ability to control its costs 
the company cannot provide assurance that it will compete effectively and maintain current levels of sales and profitability 
if the company cannot compete effectively  such failure will have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations 
the company s manufacturing businesses may have difficulty obtaining wood fiber at favorable prices  or at all 
wood fiber is the principal raw material used by the company  comprising approximately of the total cost of sales during wood fiber is a commodity  and prices historically have been cyclical 
the primary source for wood fiber is timber 
environmental litigation and regulatory developments  alternative use for energy production and reduction in harvesting related to the housing market  have caused  and may cause in the future  significant reductions in the amount of timber available for commercial harvest in the united states and canada 
in addition  future domestic or foreign legislation and litigation concerning the use of timberlands  the protection of endangered species  the promotion of forest health and the response to and prevention of catastrophic wildfires could also affect timber supplies 
availability of harvested timber may be further limited by adverse weather  fire  insect infestation  disease  ice storms  wind storms  flooding and other natural and man made causes  thereby reducing supply and increasing prices 
wood fiber pricing is subject to regional market influences  and the company s cost of wood fiber may increase in particular regions due to market shifts in those regions 
any sustained increase in wood fiber prices would increase the company s operating costs  and the company may be unable to increase prices for its products in response to increased wood fiber costs due to additional factors affecting the demand or supply of these products 
the company currently obtains its wood fiber requirements by purchasing wood fiber from third parties and in part by harvesting timber pursuant to its forest licenses and forest management agreements 
if the company s cutting rights  pursuant to its forest licenses or forest management agreements are reduced  or any third party supplier of wood fiber stops selling or is unable to sell wood fiber to the company  its financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
an increase in the cost of the company s purchased energy or chemicals would lead to higher manufacturing costs  thereby reducing its margins 
the company s operations consume substantial amounts of energy such as electricity  natural gas  fuel oil  coal and hog fuel 
energy comprised approximately of the total cost of sales in energy prices  particularly for electricity  natural gas and fuel oil  have been volatile in recent years 
as a result  fluctuations in energy prices will impact the company s manufacturing costs and contribute to earnings volatility 
while the company purchases substantial portions of its energy under supply contracts  most of these contracts are based on market pricing 
other raw materials the company uses include various chemical compounds  such as precipitated calcium carbonate  sodium chlorate and sodium hydroxide  sulfuric acid  dyes  peroxide  methanol and aluminum sulfate 
purchases of chemicals comprised approximately of the total cost of sales in the costs of these chemicals have been volatile historically  and they are influenced by capacity utilization  energy prices and other factors beyond the company s control 
due to the commodity nature of the company s products  the relationship between industry supply and demand for these products  rather than solely changes in the cost of raw materials  will determine the company s ability to increase prices 
consequently  the company may be unable to pass on increases in its operating costs to 
table of contents its customers 
any sustained increase in chemical or energy prices without any corresponding increase in product pricing would reduce the company s operating margins and may have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations 
the company depends on third parties for transportation services 
the company relies primarily on third parties for transportation of the products it manufactures and or distributes  as well as delivery of its raw materials 
in particular  a significant portion of the goods it manufactures and raw materials it uses are transported by railroad or trucks  which are highly regulated 
if any of its third party transportation providers were to fail to deliver the goods the company manufactures or distributes in a timely manner  the company may be unable to sell those products at full value  or at all 
similarly  if any of these providers were to fail to deliver raw materials to the company in a timely manner  it may be unable to manufacture its products in response to customer demand 
in addition  if any of these third parties were to cease operations or cease doing business with the company  it may be unable to replace them at reasonable cost 
any failure of a third party transportation provider to deliver raw materials or finished products in a timely manner could harm the company s reputation  negatively impact its customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and operating results 
the company could experience disruptions in operations and or increased labor costs due to labor disputes or restructuring activities 
employees at of the company s facilities  a majority of the company s  employees  are represented by unions through collective bargaining agreements  generally on a facility by facility basis  certain of which expired in and some will expire between and currently  collective bargaining agreements are up for renegotiation of which only three are currently under negotiation 
the company may not be able to negotiate acceptable new collective bargaining agreements  which could result in strikes or work stoppages or other labor disputes by affected workers 
renewal of collective bargaining agreements could also result in higher wages or benefits paid to union members 
in addition  labor organizing activities could occur at any of the company s facilities 
therefore  the company could experience a disruption of its operations or higher ongoing labor costs  which could have a material adverse effect on its business and financial condition 
in connection with the company s restructuring efforts  the company has suspended operations at  or closed or announced its intention to close  various facilities and may incur liability with respect to affected employees  which could have a material adverse effect on its business or financial condition 
in addition  the company continues to evaluate potential adjustments to its production capacity  which may include additional closures of machines or entire mills  and the company could recognize significant cash and or non cash charges relating to any such closures in the future 
the pulp and paper mill in prince albert was closed in the first quarter of and has not been operated since 
in december  we decided to dismantle the prince albert facility 
in a grievance relating to the closure of the prince albert facility  the union claimed that it was entitled to the accumulated pension benefits during the actual layoff period because  according to the union  a majority of employees still had recall rights during the layoff 
arbitration in this matter was held on february to   and the arbitrator ruled in favor of the company on august  the arbitrator s decision is subject to the union s right to apply for judicial review 
the company relies heavily on a small number of significant customers  including one customer that represented approximately of the company s sales in a loss of any of these significant customers could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
the company heavily relies on a small number of significant customers 
the company s largest customer represented approximately of the company s sales in a significant reduction in sales to any of the 
table of contents company s key customers  which could be due to factors outside its control  such as purchasing diversification or financial difficulties experienced by these customers  could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
a material disruption at one or more of the company s manufacturing facilities could prevent it from meeting customer demand  reduce its sales and or negatively impact its net income 
any of the company s pulp or paper manufacturing facilities  or any of its machines within an otherwise operational facility  could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events  including unscheduled maintenance outages  prolonged power failures  equipment failure  chemical spill or release  explosion of a boiler  the effect of a drought or reduced rainfall on its water supply  labor difficulties  government regulations  disruptions in the transportation infrastructure  including roads  bridges  railroad tracks and tunnels  adverse weather  fires  floods  earthquakes  hurricanes or other catastrophes  terrorism or threats of terrorism  or other operational problems  including those resulting from the risks described in this section 
events such as those listed above have resulted in operating losses in the past 
future events may cause shutdowns  which may result in additional downtime and or cause additional damage to the company s facilities 
any such downtime or facility damage could prevent the company from meeting customer demand for its products and or require it to make unplanned capital expenditures 
if one or more of these machines or facilities were to incur significant downtime  it may have a material adverse effect on the company financial results and financial position 
the company s indebtedness  which is approximately million as of december   could adversely affect its financial condition and impair its ability to operate its business 
as of december   the company had approximately million of outstanding indebtedness  including million of capital leases and million of unsecured notes 
the company s degree of indebtedness could have important consequences to the company s financial condition  operating results and business  including the following it may limit the company s ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing for working capital  capital expenditures  product development  debt service requirements  acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes  a portion of the company s cash flows from operations will be dedicated to payments on its indebtedness and will not be available for other purposes  including operations  capital expenditures and future business opportunities  the debt service requirements of the company s indebtedness could make it more difficult for the company to satisfy its other obligations  
table of contents the company s borrowings under the senior secured revolving credit facilities are at variable rates of interest  exposing the company to increased debt service obligations in the event of increased interest rates  it may limit the company s ability to adjust to changing market conditions and place it at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that have less debt  and it may increase the company s vulnerability to a downturn in general economic conditions or in its business  and may make the company unable to carry out capital spending that is important to its growth 
in addition  the company is subject to agreements that require meeting and maintaining certain financial ratios and tests 
a significant or prolonged downturn in general business and economic conditions may affect the company s ability to comply with these covenants or meet those financial ratios and tests and could require the company to take action to reduce its debt or to act in a manner contrary to its current business objectives 
a breach of any of the senior secured revolving credit facility or long term note indenture covenants may result in an event of default under those agreements 
this may allow the counterparties to those agreements to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder  together with accrued interest  to be immediately due and payable 
if this occurs  the company may not be able to refinance the indebtedness on favorable terms  or at all  or repay the accelerated indebtedness 
the company s operations require substantial capital  and it may not have adequate capital resources to provide for all of its capital requirements 
the company s businesses are capital intensive and require that it regularly incur capital expenditures in order to maintain its equipment  increase its operating efficiency and comply with environmental laws 
in  the company s total capital expenditures were million million 
in addition  million was spent under the pulp and paper green transformation program nil  which is reimbursed by the government of canada 
if the company s available cash resources and cash generated from operations are not sufficient to fund its operating needs and capital expenditures  the company would have to obtain additional funds from borrowings or other available sources or reduce or delay its capital expenditures 
the company may not be able to obtain additional funds on favorable terms  or at all 
in addition  the company s debt service obligations will reduce its available cash flows 
if the company cannot maintain or upgrade its equipment as it requires or allocate funds to ensure environmental compliance  it could be required to curtail or cease some of its manufacturing operations  or it may become unable to manufacture products that compete effectively in one or more of its product lines 
despite current indebtedness levels  the company and its subsidiaries may incur substantially more debt 
this could further exacerbate the risks associated with its leverage 
the company and its subsidiaries may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future 
although the senior secured revolving credit facility contains restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness  including secured indebtedness  these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions  and additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial 
as of december   the company had no borrowings under the senior secured revolving credit facility and had outstanding letters of credit amounting to million under this senior secured revolving credit facility  resulting in million of availability for future drawings under this credit facility 
other new borrowings could also be incurred by domtar corporation or its subsidiaries 
among other things  the company could determine to incur additional debt in connection with a strategic acquisition 
if the company incurs additional debt  the risks associated with its leverage would increase 

table of contents the company s ability to generate the significant amount of cash needed to pay interest and principal on the domtar corporation notes and service its other debt and financial obligations and its ability to refinance all or a portion of its indebtedness or obtain additional financing depends on many factors beyond the company s control 
the company has considerable debt service obligations 
the company s ability to make payments on and refinance its debt  including the domtar corporation notes and amounts borrowed under its senior secured revolving credit facility and other financial obligations and to fund its operations will depend on its ability to generate substantial operating cash flow 
the company s cash flow generation will depend on its future performance  which will be subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  many of which are beyond its control 
the company s business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future borrowings may not be available to the company under its senior secured revolving credit facility or otherwise in amounts sufficient to enable the company to service its indebtedness  including the domtar corporation notes  and borrowings  if any  under its senior secured revolving credit facilities or to fund its other liquidity needs 
if the company cannot service its debt  the company will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital investments  selling assets  restructuring or refinancing its debt or seeking additional equity capital 
any of these remedies may not be effected on commercially reasonable terms  or at all  and may impede the implementation of its business strategy 
furthermore  the senior secured revolving credit facility may restrict the company from adopting any of these alternatives 
because of these and other factors that may be beyond its control  the company may be unable to service its indebtedness 
the company is affected by changes in currency exchange rates 
the company manufactures a significant portion of pulp and paper in canada 
sales of these products by the company s canadian operations will be invoiced in us dollars or in canadian dollars linked to us pricing but most of the costs relating to these products will be incurred in canadian dollars 
as a result  any decrease in the value of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar will reduce the company s profitability 
exchange rate fluctuations are beyond the company s control 
from to  the canadian dollar had appreciated over relative to the us dollar 
in  when compared to  the canadian dollar increased in value by approximately relative to the us dollar 
the level of the canadian dollar can have a material adverse effect on the sales and profitability of the canadian operations 
the company has liabilities with respect to its pension plans and the actual cost of its pension plan obligations could exceed current provisions 
as of december   the company s defined benefit plans had a surplus of million on certain plans and a deficit of million on others on an ongoing basis 
the company s future funding obligations for the defined benefit pension plans depend upon changes to the level of benefits provided by the plans  the future performance of assets set aside in trusts for these plans  the level of interest rates used to determine minimum funding levels  actuarial data and experience  and any changes in government laws and regulations 
as of december   the company s canadian defined benefit pension plans held assets with a fair value of  million cdn  million  including a fair value of million cdn million of asset backed commercial paper abcp 
most of the abcp investments were subject to restructuring under the court order governing the montreal accord that was completed in january while the remainder is in conduits restructured outside the montreal accord or subject to litigation between the sponsor and the credit counterparty 
at december   the company determined that the fair value of these abcp investments was million cdn million million cdn million 
possible changes that could have a material effect on the future value of the abcp include changes in the value of the underlying assets and the related derivatives transaction  developments related to the liquidity of the abcp market  and a severe and prolonged economic slowdown in north america and the bankruptcy of referenced corporate credits 

table of contents the company does not expect any potential short term liquidity issues to affect the pension funds since pension fund obligations are primarily long term in nature 
losses in pension fund investments  if any  would result in future increased contributions by the company or its canadian subsidiaries 
additional contributions to these pension funds would be required to be paid over year or year periods  depending upon the applicable provincial requirement for funding solvency deficits 
losses  if any  would also impact operating results over a longer period of time and immediately increase liabilities and reduce equity 
the company could incur substantial costs as a result of compliance with  violations of or liabilities under applicable environmental laws and regulations 
it could also incur costs as a result of asbestos related personal injury litigation 
the company is subject  in both the united states and canada  to a wide range of general and industry specific laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and natural resources  including those governing air emissions  greenhouse gases and climate change  wastewater discharges  harvesting  silvicultural activities  the storage  management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes  the cleanup of contaminated sites  landfill operation and closure obligations  forestry operations and endangered species habitat  and health and safety matters 
in particular  the pulp and paper industry in the united states is subject to the united states environmental protection agency s epa cluster rules 
the company has incurred  and expects that it will continue to incur  significant capital  operating and other expenditures complying with applicable environmental laws and regulations as a result of remedial obligations 
the company incurred approximately million of operating expenses and million of capital expenditures in connection with environmental compliance and remediation for as of december  the company had a provision of million for environmental expenditures  including certain asset retirement obligations such as for land fill capping and asbestos removal million as of december  
the pulp and paper mill in prince albert was closed in the first quarter of and has not been operated since 
in december  the company decided to dismantle the prince albert facility 
the province of saskatchewan may require active decommissioning and reclamation at the facility 
in the event decommissioning and reclamation is required at the facility  the work is likely to include investigation and remedial action for areas of significant environmental impacts 
the company has a reserve for the estimated required environmental remediation at the site 
the company also could incur substantial costs  such as civil or criminal fines  sanctions and enforcement actions including orders limiting its operations or requiring corrective measures  installation of pollution control equipment or other remedial actions  cleanup and closure costs  and third party claims for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of  or liabilities under  environmental laws and regulations 
the company s ongoing efforts to identify potential environmental concerns that may be associated with its past and present properties will lead to future environmental investigations 
those efforts will likely result in the determination of additional environmental costs and liabilities which cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
as the owner and operator of real estate  the company may be liable under environmental laws for cleanup  closure and other damages resulting from the presence and release of hazardous substances  including asbestos  on or from its properties or operations 
the amount and timing of environmental expenditures is difficult to predict  and  in some cases  the company s liability may be imposed without regard to contribution or to whether it knew of  or caused  the release of hazardous substances and may exceed forecasted amounts or the value of the property itself 
the discovery of additional contamination or the imposition of additional cleanup obligations at the company s or third party sites may result in significant additional costs 
any material liability the company incurs could adversely impact its financial condition or preclude it from making capital expenditures that would otherwise benefit its business 
in addition  the company may be subject to asbestos related personal injury litigation arising out of exposure to asbestos on or from its properties or operations  and may incur substantial costs as a result of any defense  settlement  or adverse judgment in such litigation 
the company may not have access to insurance proceeds to cover costs associated with asbestos related personal injury litigation 

table of contents enactment of new environmental laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations  or interpretation thereof  might require significant expenditures 
for example  changes in climate change regulation see item  legal proceedings  under the caption climate change regulation  and see item note commitments and contingencies industrial boiler maximum achievable controlled technology standard 
the company may be unable to generate funds or other sources of liquidity and capital to fund environmental liabilities or expenditures 
failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse affect on our business  financial results or condition 
in addition to environmental laws  our business and operations are subject to a broad range of other laws and regulations in the united states and canada as well as other jurisdictions in which we operate  including antitrust and competition laws  occupational health and safety laws and employment laws 
many of these laws and regulations are complex and subject to evolving and differing interpretation 
if the company is determined to have violated any such laws or regulations  whether inadvertently or willfully  it may be subject to civil and criminal penalties  including substantial fines  or claims for damages by third parties which may have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the company s intellectual property rights are valuable  and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of its products and its brands 
the company relies on patent  trademark  and other intellectual property laws of the united states and other countries to protect its intellectual property rights 
however  the company may be unable to prevent third parties from using its intellectual property without its authorization  which may reduce any competitive advantage it has developed 
if the company had to litigate to protect these rights  any proceedings could be costly  and it may not prevail 
the company cannot guarantee that any united states or foreign patents  issued or pending  will provide it with any competitive advantage or will not be challenged by third parties 
additionally  the company has obtained and applied for united states and foreign trademark registrations  and will continue to evaluate the registration of additional service marks and trademarks  as appropriate 
the company cannot guarantee that any of its pending patent or trademark applications will be approved by the applicable governmental authorities and  even if the applications are approved  third parties may seek to oppose or otherwise challenge these registrations 
the failure to secure any pending patent or trademark applications may limit the company s ability to protect the intellectual property rights that these applications were intended to cover 
if the company is unable to successfully retain and develop executive leadership and other key personnel  it may be unable to fully realize critical organizational strategies  goals and objectives 
the success of the company is substantially dependent on the efforts and abilities of its key personnel  including its executive management team  to develop and implement its business strategies and manage its operations 
the failure to retain key personnel or to develop successors with appropriate skills and experience for key positions in the company could adversely affect the development and achievement of critical organizational strategies  goals and objectives 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retain or develop the key personnel it needs and the failure to do so may adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations 
a third party has demanded an increase in consideration from domtar inc under an existing contract 
in july  domtar inc now a owned subsidiary of domtar corporation acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of eb eddy limited and eb eddy paper  inc eb eddy  an integrated producer of specialty paper and wood products 
the purchase agreement includes a purchase price adjustment whereby  in the event of the acquisition by a third party of more than of the shares of domtar inc in specified

the province of saskatchewan may require active decommissioning and reclamation at the facility 
in the event decommissioning and reclamation is required at the facility  the work is likely to include investigation and remedial action for areas of significant environmental impacts 
the company has a reserve for the estimated required environmental remediation at the site 
an action was commenced by seaspan international ltd 
seaspan in the supreme court of british columbia  on march  against domtar inc and others with respect to alleged contamination of seaspan s site bordering burrard inlet in north vancouver  british columbia  including contamination of sediments in burrard inlet  due to the presence of creosote and heavy metals 
as of july   the parties entered into a partial settlement agreement the settlement agreement which provided that  while the agreement is performed in accordance with its terms  the action commenced by seaspan will be held in abeyance 
the settlement agreement focused on the sharing of costs between seaspan and domtar inc for certain remediation of contamination referred to in the plaintiff s claim 
the settlement agreement did not address all of the plaintiff s claims and such claims cannot be reasonably determined at this time 
on june   domtar was notified by seaspan that it terminated the settlement agreement 
the government of british columbia issued on february  a remediation order to seaspan and domtar inc in order to define and implement an action plan to address soil  sediment and 
table of contents groundwater issues 
this order was appealed to the environmental appeal board the board but there is no suspension in the execution of this order unless the board orders otherwise 
the hearing scheduled for january was cancelled with no alternative date scheduled as of yet 
the relevant government authorities are reviewing several remediation plans 
the company has recorded an environmental reserve to address estimated exposure 
at december   the company had a provision of million for environmental matters and other asset retirement obligations million in 
additional costs  not known or identifiable  could be incurred for remediation efforts 
based on policies and procedures in place to monitor environmental exposure  management believes that such additional remediation costs would not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  result of operations or cash flows 
climate change regulation since  when an international conference on global warming concluded an agreement known as the kyoto protocol  which called for reductions of certain emissions that may contribute to increases in atmospheric greenhouse gas ghg concentrations  various international  national and local laws have been proposed or implemented focusing on reducing ghg emissions 
these actual or proposed laws do or may apply in the countries where the company currently has  or may have in the future  manufacturing facilities or investments 
in the united states  the th congress may consider legislation to reduce emissions of ghgs 
in june  the us house of representatives passed the american clean energy and security act of  a cap and trade bill designed to reduce ghg emissions 
in september the clean energy jobs and american power act was introduced in the us senate  but the legislation ultimately was not passed 
in december  the carbon limits and energy for america s recovery clear act was also introduced in the us senate 
in addition  several states are already requiring the reduction of ghg emissions by certain companies and public utilities  primarily through the planned development of ghg emission inventories and or state ghg cap and trade programs 
in addition  the us environmental protection agency epa is beginning to regulate ghg emissions 
the us supreme court ruled in april in massachusetts et al 
v 
epa  that ghgs fall under the federal clean air act s definition of air pollutant 
in december  the epa issued its endangerment findings which found that ghgs endanger public health and welfare 
the finding itself does not impose any requirement on our industry but is a pre requisite for epa to regulate ghg emissions 
passage of climate control legislation or other regulatory initiatives by congress or various us states  or the adoption of regulations by the epa or analogous state agencies that restrict emissions of ghgs in areas in which the company conducts business may have a material effect on our operations 
the company expects not to be disproportionately affected by these measures compared with other pulp and paper operations in the united states 
there are presently no federal or provincial legislative or regulatory obligations to reduce ghg for our pulp and paper operations in canada 
while it is likely that there will be increased regulation relating to ghg and climate change  at this stage it is not possible to estimate either a timetable for the promulgation or implementation of any new regulations or the company s cost of compliance to said regulations
