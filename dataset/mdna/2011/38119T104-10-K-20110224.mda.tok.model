canadian reporting requirements for disclosure of mineral properties are governed by national instrument ni 
the definitions in ni are adopted from those given by the canadian institute of mining  metallurgy and petroleum 
us reporting requirements for disclosure of mineral properties are governed by the sec industry guide these reporting standards have similar goals in terms of conveying an appropriate level of confidence in the disclosures being reported  but embody differing approaches and definitions 
we estimate and report our mineral resources and mineral reserves according to the definitions set forth in ni and modify them as appropriate to conform to sec industry guide for reporting in the us the definitions for each reporting standard are presented below with supplementary explanation and descriptions of the similarities and differences 
ni definitions mineral reserve the term mineral reserve refers to the economically mineable part of a measured or indicated mineral resource demonstrated by at least a preliminary feasibility study 
the study must include adequate information on mining  processing  metallurgical  economic  and other relevant factors that demonstrate  at the time of reporting  that economic extraction can be justified 
a mineral reserve includes diluting materials and allowances for losses that may occur when the material is mined 
proven mineral reserve the term proven mineral reserve refers to the economically mineable part of a measured mineral resource demonstrated by at least a preliminary feasibility study 
this study must include adequate information on mining  processing  metallurgical  economic  and other relevant factors that demonstrate  at the time of reporting  that economic extraction is justified 
probable mineral reserve the term probable mineral reserve refers to the economically mineable part of an indicated  and in some circumstances  a measured mineral resource demonstrated by at least a preliminary feasibility study 
this study must include adequate information on mining  processing  metallurgical  economic  and other relevant factors that demonstrate  at the time of reporting  that economic extraction is justified 
mineral resource the term mineral resource refers to a concentration or occurrence of diamonds  natural solid inorganic material  or natural solid fossilized organic material including base and precious metals  coal  and industrial minerals in or on the earth s crust in such form and quantity and of such a grade or quality that it has reasonable prospects for economic extraction 
the location  quantity  grade  geological characteristics and continuity of a mineral resource are known  estimated or interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge 
measured mineral resource the term measured mineral resource refers to that part of a mineral resource for which quantity  grade or quality  densities  shape and physical characteristics are so well established that they can be estimated with confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic parameters  to support production planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit 
the estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration  sampling and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops  trenches  pits  workings and drill holes that are spaced closely enough to confirm both geological and grade continuity 
indicated mineral resource the term indicated mineral resource refers to that part of a mineral resource for which quantity  grade or quality  densities  shape and physical characteristics can be estimated with a level of confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic parameters  to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit 
the estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops  trenches  pits  workings and drill holes that are spaced closely enough for geological and grade continuity to be reasonably assumed 
inferred mineral resource the term inferred mineral resource refers to that part of a mineral resource for which quantity and grade or quality can be estimated on the basis of geological evidence and limited sampling and reasonably assumed  but not verified  geological and grade continuity 
the estimate is based on limited information and sampling gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops  trenches  pits  workings and drill holes 
qualified person the term qualified person refers to an individual who is an engineer or geoscientist with at least five years of experience in mineral exploration  mine development or operation or mineral project assessment  or any combination of these  has experience relevant to the subject matter of the mineral project and the technical report and is a member in good standing of a professional association 
sec industry guide definitions reserve the term reserve refers to that part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination 
reserves must be supported by a feasibility study done to bankable standards that demonstrates the economic extraction 
bankable standards implies that the confidence attached to the costs and achievements developed in the study is sufficient for the project to be eligible for external debt financing 
a reserve includes adjustments to the in situ tonnes and grade to include diluting materials and allowances for losses that might occur when the material is mined 
proven reserve the term proven reserve refers to reserves for which a quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops  trenches  workings or drill holes  grade and or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling and b the sites for inspection  sampling and measurement are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that size  shape depth and mineral content of reserves are well established 
probable reserve the term probable reserve refers to reserves for which quantity and grade and or quality are computed from information similar to that used for proven measured reserves  but the sites for inspection  sampling  and measurement are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced 
the degree of assurance  although lower than that for proven reserves  is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation 
mineralized material the term mineralized material refers to material that is not included in the reserve as it does not meet all of the criteria for adequate demonstration for economic or legal extraction 
non reserves the term non reserves refers to mineralized material that is not included in the reserve as it does not meet all of the criteria for adequate demonstration for economic or legal extraction 
exploration stage an exploration stage prospect is one which is not in either the development or production stage 
development stage a development stage project is one which is undergoing preparation of an established commercially mineable deposit for its extraction but which is not yet in production 
this stage occurs after completion of a feasibility study 
production stage a production stage project is actively engaged in the process of extraction and beneficiation of mineral reserves to produce a marketable metal or mineral product 
industry guide does not require designation of a qualified person 
for industry guide purposes the feasibility study must include adequate information on mining  processing  metallurgical  economic  and other relevant factors that demonstrate  at the time of reporting  that economic extraction is justified

the design capacity of the carbon in leach processing plant at wassa wassa plant is nominally million tonnes per annum but varies depending on the ratio of hard to soft ore 
gswl also owns the hwini butre and benso concessions the hbb properties in southwest ghana 
the hbb properties send their ore to wassa for processing 
the hwini butre and benso concessions are located approximately km and km  respectively  by road south of wassa 
wassa hbb produced and sold  ounces of gold in and  ounces of gold in we also hold interests in several gold exploration projects in ghana and elsewhere in west africa including sierra leone  burkina faso  niger and c te d ivoire  and in south america where we hold exploration properties in brazil 
all our operations  with the exception of certain exploration projects  transact business in us dollars and keep financial records in us dollars 
our accounting records are kept in accordance with cdn gaap 
our fiscal year ends december we are a reporting issuer or the equivalent in all provinces of canada  in ghana and in the united states and file disclosure documents with securities regulatory authorities in canada and ghana  and with the united states securities and exchange commission 
note that gold productions mineral reserves and mineral resources are shown on a basis in this form k  which represents our current beneficial interest 
while the government of ghana owns a carried interest in gsbpl and in gswl  the government s interest is limited to of any dividends distributed from gsbpl and gswl but only after their outstanding loans and interest have been repaid to golden star 
the mineral resources at prestea underground  which are owned by gsbpl  are also subject to the government of ghana s minority interest  resulting in an effective interest 
gold sales and production ghana has been a significant gold producing country for over years with anglogold ashanti s obuasi mine and our inactive underground mine at prestea historically being the two major producers 
several other areas in ghana have also produced large amounts of gold 
ghana produced just under million ounces of gold in currently  all our gold production is shipped to a south african gold refinery in accordance with a long term gold sales contract 
our gold is sold in the form of dor bars that average approximately gold by weight with the remaining portion being silver and other metals 
the sales price is based on the london pm fix on the day of shipment to the refinery 
gold price history the price of gold is volatile and is affected by numerous factors all of which are beyond our control such as the sale or purchase of gold by various central banks and financial institutions  inflation  recession  fluctuation in the relative values of the us dollar and foreign currencies  changes in global and regional gold demand  and the political and economic conditions of major gold producing countries throughout the world

benso development activities started in late  and in we began trucking ore from the benso mine to the wassa plant for processing 
hwini butre development was initiated in the fourth quarter of  and in may the hwini butre mine began shipping ore to the wassa plant for processing 
our overall objective is to grow our business to become a mid tier gold producer 
we continue to evaluate potential acquisition and merger opportunities that could further increase our annual gold production 
however  we presently have no agreement or understanding with respect to any specific potential transaction 
in addition to our gold mining and development activities  we actively explore for gold in west africa and south america  investing approximately million on such activities during and approximately million during we are conducting regional reconnaissance projects in ghana  cote d ivoire and brazil  and have drilled more advanced targets in ghana  niger  sierra leone  burkina faso and brazil

mineral reserves our proven and probable mineral reserves are estimated in conformance with definitions set out in ni we have filed technical reports regarding the initial disclosure of mineral reserves and mineral resources for bogoso prestea and wassa hbb as required by ni the proven and probable mineral reserves are those ore tonnages contained within economically optimized pits  configured using current and predicted mining and processing methods and related operating costs and performance parameters 
we believe that our mineral reserves are estimated on a basis consistent with the definition of proven and probable reserves prescribed for use in the us by the us securities and exchange commission and set forth in sec industry guide see our glossary of terms 
in estimating mineral reserves  we first design an economically optimized pit based on all operating costs  including the costs to mine 
since all material lying within the optimized pit will be mined  the cut off grade used in determining our mineral reserves is estimated based on the material that  having been mined  is economic to transport and process without regard to primary mining costs ie mining costs that were appropriately applied at the economic optimization stage 
the qa qc controls program used in connection with the estimation of our mineral reserves consists of regular insertion and analysis of blanks and standards to monitor laboratory performance 
blanks are used to check for contamination 
standards are used to check for grade dependence biases

the stated mineral reserves have been prepared in accordance with canada s national instrument standards of disclosure for mineral projects and are classified in accordance with the canadian institute of mining  metallurgy and petroleum s cim definition standards for mineral resources and mineral reserves 
mineral reserves are equivalent to proven and probable reserves as defined by the sec industry guide mineral reserve estimates reflect the company s reasonable expectation that all necessary permits and approvals will be obtained and maintained 
mining dilution and mining recovery vary by deposit and have been applied in estimating the mineral reserves 
the and mineral reserves were prepared under the supervision of mr 
karl smith  vice president technical services for the company 
mr 
smith is a qualified person as defined by canada s national instrument the mineral reserves at december   were estimated using a gold price of  per ounce  which is approximately equal to the three year average gold price 
at december   mineral reserves were estimated using a gold price of per ounce 
the terms non refractory and refractory refer to the metallurgical characteristics of the ore and are defined in the glossary of terms 
we plan to process the refractory ore in our sulfide bio oxidation plant at bogoso and to process the non refractory ore using our more traditional gravity  flotation and or cyanidation techniques 
the slope angles of all pit designs are based on geotechnical criteria as established by external consultants 
the size and shape of the pit designs are guided by consideration of the results from a pit optimization program which incorporates historical and projected operating costs at bogoso prestea  wassa and hwini butre and benso 
metallurgical recoveries are based on historical performance or estimated from test work and typically range from to for non refractory ores and from to for refractory ores

where such a variance occurs it will arise from the differing requirements for reporting mineral reserves 
for example  ni has a minimum requirement that mineral reserves be supported by a pre feasibility study  whereas sec industry guide requires support from a detailed feasibility study that demonstrates that economic extraction is justified 
for the mineral reserves at december   and  there is no difference between the mineral reserves as disclosed under ni and those disclosed under sec industry guide  and therefore no reconciliation is provided

employees as of december   golden star  including our majority owned subsidiaries  had approximately  full time employees and approximately contract employees  for a total of  a increase from the approximately  full time and contract employees at the end of the total includes employees at our principal office in littleton  colorado and exploration personnel in south america 
customers currently all of our gold production is shipped to a south african gold refinery in accordance with a gold sales contract 
the refinery arranges for sale of the gold on the day it is shipped from the mine site and we receive payment for gold sold approximately two working days after the gold leaves the mine site 
the global gold market is competitive with numerous banks and refineries willing to buy gold on short notice 
therefore  we believe that the loss of our current customer would not materially delay or disrupt revenues 
competition our competitive position depends upon our ability to successfully and economically explore  acquire and develop new and existing gold properties 
factors that allow gold producers to remain competitive in the market over the long term include the quality and size of ore bodies  cost of operation  and the acquisition and retention of qualified employees 
we compete with other mining companies in the acquisition  exploration  financing and development of new mineral properties 
many of these companies are larger and better capitalized than we are 
there is significant competition for a limited number of gold acquisition and exploration opportunities 
we also compete with other mining companies for skilled mining engineers  mine and processing plant operators and mechanics  mining equipment  geologists  geophysicists and other experienced technical personnel 
seasonality all of our operations are in tropical climates that experience annual rainy seasons 
ore output from our surface mining operations can be reduced during wet periods 
while mine plans anticipate periods of high rain fall each year  in the third and fourth quarters of unusually heavy rainfall disrupted operations at both bogoso prestea and wassa hbb for extended periods 
exploration activities are generally timed to avoid the rainy periods to ease transportation logistics associated with wet roads and swollen rivers

risk factors you should consider the following discussion of risks in addition to the other information contained in or included by reference in this form k 
in addition to historical information  the information in this form k contains forward looking statements about our future business and performance 
our actual operating results and financial performance may be very different from what we expect as of the date of this form k 
the risks below address material factors that may affect our future operating results and financial performance 
general risks a substantial or prolonged decline in gold prices would have a material adverse effect on us 
the price of our common shares  our financial results and our exploration  development and mining activities have previously been  and would in the future be significantly adversely affected by a substantial or prolonged decline in the price of gold 
the price of gold is volatile and is affected by numerous factors beyond our control such as the sale or purchase of gold by various central banks and financial institutions  inflation or deflation  fluctuation in the value of the united states dollar and foreign currencies  global and regional demand  and the political and economic conditions of major gold producing countries throughout the world 
any drop in the price of gold adversely impacts our revenues  profits and cash flows 
in particular  a sustained low gold price could cause suspension of our mining operations at bogoso prestea and wassa hbb if these operations become uneconomic at the then prevailing gold price  thus further reducing revenues  cause us to be unable to fulfill our obligations under agreements with our partners or under our permits and licenses which could cause us to lose our interests in  or be forced to sell  some of our properties  cause us to be unable to fulfill our debt payment obligations  halt or delay the development of new projects  and reduce funds available for exploration  with the result that depleted mineral reserves are not replaced 
furthermore  the need to reassess the feasibility of any of our projects because of declining gold prices could cause substantial delays or could interrupt operations until a reassessment could be completed 
mineral reserve estimations and life of mine plans using significantly lower gold prices could result in reduced estimates of mineral reserves and non reserve mineral resources and in material write downs of our investment in mining properties and increased amortization  reclamation and closure charges 
we have incurred and may in the future incur substantial losses that could make financing our operations and business strategy more difficult and that may affect our ability to service our debts as they become due 
while we had net income of million in  we experienced net losses of million  million and million in  and  respectively  and have experienced net losses in other prior fiscal years 
in recent years  increasing operating costs  natural variation in ore grades and gold recovery rates within the pits mined  and impairment write offs of mine property and exploration property costs have been the primary factors contributing to such losses 
in the future  these factors  as well as declining gold prices  could cause us to continue to be unprofitable 
future operating losses could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital if needed  and could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
in addition  continuing operating losses could affect our ability to meet our debt payment obligations 
our obligations could strain our financial position and impede our business strategy 
we had total consolidated debt and liabilities as of december   of million  including million in equipment financing loans  million million including the loan s equity portion pursuant to the convertible debentures  million of current trade payables  accrued current and other liabilities  million of current and future taxes  million payable under capital leases and a million accrual for environmental rehabilitation liabilities 
our indebtedness and other liabilities may increase as a result of general corporate activities 
these liabilities could have important consequences  including the following increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital  capital expenditures  exploration costs and other general corporate requirements  requiring us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments  which would reduce our ability to fund working capital  capital expenditures  exploration and other general corporate requirements  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry  and placing us at a disadvantage when compared to our competitors that have less debt relative to their market capitalization 
our estimates of mineral reserves and non reserves could be inaccurate  which could cause actual production and costs to differ from estimates 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating proven and probable mineral reserves and non reserve measured  indicated and inferred mineral resources  including many factors beyond our control 
the accuracy of estimates of mineral reserves and non reserves is a function of the quantity and quality of available data and of the assumptions made and judgments used in engineering and geological interpretation  which could prove to be unreliable 
these estimates of mineral reserves and non reserves may not be accurate  and mineral reserves and non reserves may not be able to be mined or processed profitably 
fluctuation in gold prices  results of drilling  metallurgical testing  changes in operating costs  production  and the evaluation of mine plans subsequent to the date of any estimate could require revision of the estimates 
the volume and grade of mineral reserves mined and processed and recovery rates might not be the same as currently anticipated 
any material reductions in estimates of our mineral reserves and non reserves  or of our ability to extract these mineral reserves and non reserves  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we currently have only two sources of operational cash flows  which could be insufficient by themselves to fund our continuing exploration and development activities 
while we have received significant infusions of cash from sales of equity and debt securities  our only current significant internal sources of funds are operational cash flows from bogoso prestea and wassa hbb 
the anticipated continuing exploration and development of our properties are expected to require significant expenditures over the next several years 
although we expect sufficient internal cash flow to cover all of these projects  such expenditures may exceed free cash flows generated by bogoso prestea and wassa hbb in future years  and therefore  we may require additional external debt or equity financing 
our ability to raise significant new capital will be a function of macroeconomic conditions  future gold prices  our operational performance and our then current cash flow and debt position  among other factors 
in light of the current limited global availability of credit  we may not be able to obtain adequate financing on acceptable terms or at all  which could cause us to delay or indefinitely postpone further exploration and development of our properties 
as a result  we could lose our interest in  or could be forced to sell  some of our properties 
we are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates  which could materially adversely affect our financial position 
our revenues are in united states dollars  and we maintain most of our working capital in united states dollars or united states dollar denominated securities 
we convert our united states funds to foreign currencies as certain payment obligations become due 
accordingly  we are subject to fluctuations in the rates of currency exchange between the united states dollar and these foreign currencies  and these fluctuations could materially affect our financial position and results of operations 
a significant portion of the operating costs at bogoso prestea and wassa hbb is based on the ghanaian currency  the cedi 
we are required by the government of ghana to convert into cedis of the foreign exchange proceeds that we receive from selling gold  but the government could require us to convert a higher percentage of gold sales proceeds into cedis in the future 
we obtain construction and other services and materials and supplies from providers in south africa and other countries 
the costs of goods and services could increase or decrease due to changes in the value of the united states dollar or the cedi  the euro  the south african rand or other currencies 
consequently  operation and development of our properties could be more costly than anticipated 
our hedging activities might be unsuccessful and incur losses 
during the second quarter of  we entered into contracts with respect to  ounces of gold to address potential gold price volatility 
all of these contracts expired by the end of the second quarter of as of december   we had no outstanding hedge contracts 
while we may enter into additional hedging arrangements in the future  further hedging activities might not protect adequately against declines in the price of gold 
in addition  although a hedging program could protect us from a decline in the price of gold  it might also prevent us from benefiting fully from price increases 
for example  as part of a hedging program  we could be obligated to sell gold at a price lower than the then current market price 
risks inherent in acquisitions that we might undertake could adversely affect our current business and financial condition and our growth 
we plan to continue to pursue the acquisition of producing  development and advanced stage exploration properties and companies 
the search for attractive acquisition opportunities and the completion of suitable transactions are time consuming and expensive  divert management attention from our existing business and may be unsuccessful 
success in our acquisition activities depends on our ability to complete acquisitions on acceptable terms and integrate the acquired operations successfully with our operations 
any acquisition would be accompanied by risks 
for example  there may be a significant change in commodity prices after we have committed to complete a transaction and established the purchase price or exchange ratio  a material ore body may prove to be below expectations or the acquired business or assets may have unknown liabilities which may be significant 
we may lose the services of our key employees or the key employees of any business we acquire or have difficulty integrating operations and personnel 
the integration of an acquired business or assets may disrupt our ongoing business and our relationships with employees  suppliers and contractors 
any one or more of these factors or other risks could cause us not to realize the anticipated benefits of an acquisition of properties or companies  and could have a material adverse effect on our current business and financial condition and on our ability to grow 
we are subject to litigation risks 
all industries  including the mining industry  are subject to legal claims  with and without merit 
as such  we are involved in various routine legal proceedings incidental to our business 
defense and settlement costs can be substantial  even with respect to claims that have no merit 
due to the inherent uncertainty of the litigation process  the resolution of any particular legal proceeding could have a material effect on our future financial position and results of operations 
we are subject to a number of operational hazards that can delay production or result in liability to us 
our activities are subject to a number of risks and hazards including power shortages  mechanical and electrical equipment failures  parts availability  unexpected changes in ore grades  unexpected changes in ore chemistry and gold recoverability  environmental hazards  discharge of pollutants or hazardous chemicals  industrial accidents  labor disputes and shortages  supply and shipping problems and delays  shortage of equipment and contractor availability  unusual or unexpected geological or operating conditions  cave ins of underground workings  slope failures and failure of pit walls or dams  fire  marine and transit damage and or loss  changes in the regulatory environment  including in the area of climate change  delayed or restricted access to ore due to community interventions  and natural phenomena such as inclement weather conditions  floods  droughts and earthquakes 
these or other occurrences could result in damage to  or destruction of  mineral properties or production facilities  personal injury or death  environmental damage  delays in mining  delayed production  monetary losses and possible legal liability 
satisfying such liabilities could be very costly and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
our mining operations are subject to numerous environmental laws  regulations and permitting requirements and bonding requirements that can delay production and adversely affect operating and development costs 
compliance with existing regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment  or otherwise relating to environmental protection  in the jurisdictions where we have projects may have a material adverse effect on our exploration activities  results of operations and competitive position 
new or expanded regulations  if adopted  could affect the exploration  development  or operation of our projects or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our operations 
portions of our wassa property  as well as some of our exploration properties in ghana  including dunkwa  are located within forest reserve areas 
although dunkwa and wassa have been identified by the government of ghana as eligible for mining permits  subject to normal procedures and a site inspection  permits for projects in forest reserve areas may not be issued in a timely fashion  or at all  and such permits may contain special requirements with which it is burdensome or uneconomic to comply 
mining and processing gold from our future development projects in ghana will require mining  environmental  and other permits and approvals from the government of ghana 
these permits and approvals may not be issued on a timely basis or at all  and such permits and approvals  when issued  may be subject to requirements or conditions with which it is burdensome or uneconomic to comply 
for example  although we received mining permits for prestea south in  we are still awaiting the environmental permit from the government of ghana 
such permitting issues could adversely affect our projected production commencement dates  production amounts and costs 
developing our pit at dumasi will require us to implement a resettlement action plan and reach agreements both with the residents that live close to the pit and other stakeholders 
these negotiations could be difficult or unsuccessful and may materially affect our ability to access these mineral reserves and mineral resources 
due to an increased level of non governmental organization activity targeting the mining industry in ghana  the potential for the government of ghana to delay the issuance of permits or impose new requirements or conditions upon mining operations in ghana may increase 
any changes in the government of ghana s policies  or their application  may be costly to comply with and may delay mining operations 
the exact nature of other environmental control problems  if any  which we may encounter in the future  cannot be predicted primarily because of the changing character of environmental requirements that may be enacted within the various jurisdictions where we operate 
as a result of the foregoing risks  project expenditures  production quantities and rates and cash operating costs  among other things  could be materially and adversely affected and could differ materially from anticipated expenditures  production quantities and rates  and costs 
in addition  estimated production dates could be delayed materially 
any such events could have a materially adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the development and operation of our mining projects involve numerous uncertainties that could affect the feasibility or profitability of such projects 
mine development projects  including our recent development at benso and hwini butre  typically require a number of years and significant expenditures during the development phase before production is possible 
development projects are subject to the completion of successful feasibility studies and environmental and socioeconomic assessments  the issuance of necessary governmental permits and receipt of adequate financing 
the economic feasibility of development projects is based on many factors such as estimation of mineral reserves and mineral resources  mining rate  dilution and recovery  anticipated metallurgical characteristics of the ore and gold recovery rates  environmental and community considerations including resettlement  permitting and approvals  future gold prices  and anticipated capital and operating costs 
estimates of proven and probable mineral reserves and operating costs developed in feasibility studies are based on reasonable assumptions including geologic and engineering analyses and may not prove to be accurate 
the management of mine development projects and the start up of new operations are complex 
completion of development and the commencement of production may be subject to delays  as occurred in connection with the bogoso sulfide expansion project 
any of the following events  among others  could affect the profitability or economic feasibility of a project unanticipated changes in grade and tonnage of ore to be mined and processed  unanticipated adverse geotechnical conditions  incorrect data on which engineering assumptions are made  costs of constructing and operating a mine in a specific environment  cost of processing and refining  availability of economic sources of power and fuel  availability of qualified staff  adequacy of water supply  adequate access to the site including competing land uses such as agriculture and illegal mining  unanticipated transportation costs and shipping incidents and losses  significant increases in the cost of diesel fuel  cyanide or other major components of operating costs  government regulations and changes to existing regulations including regulations relating to prices  royalties  duties  taxes  permitting  restrictions on production  quotas on exportation of minerals  protection of the environment and agricultural lands  including bonding requirements  fluctuations in gold prices  and accidents  labor actions and force majeure events 
adverse effects on the operations or further development of a project could also adversely affect our business including our ability to achieve our production estimates  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
we need to continually discover  develop or acquire additional mineral reserves for gold production and a failure to do so would adversely affect our business and financial position in the future 
because mines have limited lives based on proven and probable mineral reserves  we must continually replace and expand mineral reserves as our mines produce gold 
we are required to estimate mine life in connection with our estimation of reserves  but our estimates may not be correct 
in addition  mine life would be shortened if we expand production or if we lose reserves due to changes in gold price or operating costs 
our ability to maintain or increase our annual production of gold will be dependent in significant part on our ability to bring new mines into production and to expand or extend the life of existing mines 
gold exploration is highly speculative  involves substantial expenditures  and is frequently non productive 
gold exploration  including the exploration of the prestea underground and other projects  involves a high degree of risk 
exploration projects are frequently unsuccessful 
few prospects that are explored are ultimately developed into producing mines 
we cannot assure you that our gold exploration efforts will be successful 
the success of gold exploration is dependent in part on the following factors the identification of potential gold mineralization based on surface analysis  availability of prospective land  availability of government granted exploration and exploitation permits  the quality of our management and our geological and technical expertise  and the funding available for exploration and development 
substantial expenditures are required to determine if a project has economically mineable mineralization 
it could take several years to establish proven and probable mineral reserves and to develop and construct mining and processing facilities 
because of these uncertainties  we cannot assure you that current and future exploration programs will result in the discovery of mineral reserves  the expansion of our existing mineral reserves or the development of mines 
we face competition from other mining companies in connection with the acquisition of properties 
we face strong competition from other mining companies in connection with the acquisition of properties producing  or capable of producing gold 
many of these companies have greater financial resources  operational experience and technical capabilities 
as a result of this competition  we might be unable to maintain or acquire attractive mining properties on terms we consider acceptable or at all 
consequently  our future revenues  operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
title to our mineral properties could be challenged 
we seek to confirm the validity of our rights to title to  or contract rights with respect to  each mineral property in which we have a material interest 
we have mining leases with respect to our bogoso prestea  wassa  prestea underground and hbb properties 
title insurance generally is not available  and our ability to ensure that we have obtained a secure claim to individual mineral properties or mining concessions is limited 
we generally do not conduct surveys of our properties until they have reached the development stage  and therefore  the precise area and location of such properties could be in doubt 
accordingly  our mineral properties could be subject to prior unregistered agreements  transfers or claims  and title could be affected by  among other things  undetected defects 
in addition  we might be unable to operate our properties as permitted or to enforce our rights with respect to our properties 
we depend on the services of key executives 
we are dependent on the services of key executives including our president and chief executive officer and a small number of highly skilled and experienced executive personnel 
due to the relatively small size of our management team  the loss of one or more of these persons or our inability to attract and retain additional highly skilled employees could have an adverse effect on our business and future operations 
our insurance coverage could be insufficient 
our business is subject to a number of risks and hazards generally  including adverse environmental conditions  industrial accidents  labor disputes  unusual or unexpected geological conditions  ground or slope failures  cave ins  changes in the regulatory environment  marine transit and shipping damage and or losses  natural phenomena such as inclement weather conditions  floods and earthquakes  and political risks including expropriation and civil war 
such occurrences could result in damage to mineral properties or production facilities and equipment  personal injury or death  loss of legitimate title to properties  environmental damage to our properties or the properties of others  delays in mining  processing and development  monetary losses  and possible legal liability 
although we maintain insurance in amounts that we believe to be reasonable  our insurance might not cover all the potential risks associated with our business 
we might also be unable to maintain insurance to cover these risks at economically feasible premiums 
insurance coverage might not continue to be available or might not be adequate to cover any resulting liability 
moreover  insurance against risks such as environmental pollution or other hazards as a result of exploration and production is not generally available to us or to other companies in the mining industry on acceptable terms 
we might also become subject to liability for pollution or other hazards which we cannot insure against or which we might elect not to insure against because of premium costs or other reasons 
losses from these events might cause us to incur significant costs that could have a material adverse effect upon our financial performance and results of operations 
governmental and regulatory risks as a holding company  limitations on the ability of our operating subsidiaries to make distributions to us could adversely affect the funding of our operations 
we are a holding company that conducts operations through foreign principally ghanaian subsidiaries and joint ventures  and substantially all of our assets consist of equity in these entities 
accordingly  any limitation on the transfer of cash or other assets between the parent corporation and these entities  or among these entities  could restrict our ability to fund our operations efficiently  or to repay the convertible debentures or other debt 
any such limitations  or the perception that such limitations might exist now or in the future  could have an adverse impact on available credit and our valuation and stock price 
we are subject to changes in the regulatory environment where we operate which may increase our costs of compliance 
our mining operations and exploration activities are subject to extensive regulation governing various matters  including licensing  production  taxes  disposal of process water or waste rock  toxic substances  development and permitting  exports and imports  labor standards  mine and occupational health and safety  environmental protection and corporate responsibility  and mine rehabilitation and closure plans 
compliance with these regulations increases the costs of the following planning  designing  drilling  operating  developing  constructing  and closure  reclamation and rehabilitation and post closure 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with current laws and regulations in ghana and elsewhere 
however  these laws and regulations are subject to frequent change and reinterpretation 
amendments to current laws and regulations governing operations and activities of mining companies or more stringent implementation or interpretation of these laws and regulations could have a material adverse impact on us 
these factors could cause a reduction in levels of production and delay or prevent the development or expansion of our properties in ghana 
the implementation of changes in regulations that limit the amount of proceeds from gold sales that could be withdrawn from ghana could also have a material adverse impact on us  as bogoso prestea and wassa are currently our only sources of internally generated operating cash flows 
environmental bonding requirements are under review in ghana and bonding requirements may be increased 
as part of its periodic assessment of mine reclamation and closure costs  the ghana environmental protection agency the epa reviews the adequacy of reclamation bonds and guarantees 
in certain cases  it has requested higher levels of bonding based on its findings 
if the epa were to require additional bonding at our properties  it may be difficult  if not impossible  to provide sufficient bonding 
if we are unable to meet any such increased requirements or negotiate an acceptable solution with the ghanaian government  our operations and exploration and development activities in ghana may be materially adversely affected 
the government of ghana has the right to increase its interest in certain subsidiaries 
in accordance with the minerals and mining act  act  the government of ghana has a carried interest in the mineral operations of ghanaian mining companies 
the carried interest comes into existence at the time the government issues a mining license 
as such  the government of ghana currently has a carried interest in our subsidiaries that own the bogoso prestea properties  and the wassa hbb properties 
under act  the government has the right to acquire a special share or golden share in such subsidiaries at any time for no consideration or such consideration as the government of ghana and such subsidiaries might agree  and a pre emptive right to purchase all gold and other minerals produced by such subsidiaries 
a golden share carries no voting rights and does not participate in dividends  profits or assets 
while the government of ghana has not sought to exercise any of these rights at our properties  any such attempts to do so in the future could adversely affect our financial results 
during the first quarter of  the government of ghana amended the minerals and mining act to change the method of calculating mineral royalties payable to the government 
the prior rules established a royalty rate of not less than and not more than of a mine s total revenues  the exact amount being determined by each mine s margin as defined in the law 
under the old rules  our mines have  since their inception  qualified for and paid a rate 
under the amended law  the royalty has been set at a flat rate of of mineral revenues with an effective date of march  in october  we were notified that the effective date was extended to the end of march certain mining companies operating in ghana  including our subsidiaries gsbpl and gswl  operate under tax stabilization agreements which govern  among other things  royalty rates and various tax rules 
discussions with the ministry of finance and economic planning are ongoing to determine the applicability of this new royalty legislation to gsbpl and gswl after march we are subject to risks relating to exploration  development and operations in foreign countries 
our assets and operations are affected by various political and economic uncertainties in the countries where we operate  including war  civil unrest  terrorism  coups or other violent or unexpected changes in government  political instability and violence  expropriation and nationalization  renegotiation or nullification of existing concessions  licenses  permits  and contracts  illegal mining  changes in taxation policies such as the temporary national stabilization levy imposed by the government of ghana in july  which require payments equal to of profits before tax  unilaterally imposed increases in royalty rates  restrictions on foreign exchange and repatriation  and changing political conditions  currency controls  and governmental regulations that favor or require the awarding of contracts to local contractors or require foreign contractors to employ citizens of  or purchase supplies from  a particular jurisdiction 
illegal mining has occurred on our properties  it is difficult to control  can disrupt our business and can expose us to liability 
we continue to experience illegal mining activity on our mining and exploration properties 
most of this activity is on our prestea south and hwini butre properties 
while we are proactively working with local  regional and national governmental authorities to obtain protection of our property rights  any action on the part of such authorities may not occur  may not fully address our problems or may be delayed 
in addition to the impact on our mineral reserves and non reserves  the presence of illegal miners can lead to project delays and disputes and delays regarding the development or operation of commercial gold deposits 
illegal miners could cause environmental damage or other damage to our properties  or personal injury or death  for which we could potentially be held responsible 
illegal miners may work on other of our properties from time to time  and they may in the future increase their presence and have increased negative impacts such as those described above on such other properties 
our activities are subject to complex laws  regulations and accounting standards that can adversely affect operating and development costs  the timing of operations  the ability to operate our mines and our financial results 
our business  mining operations and exploration and development activities are subject to extensive canadian  united states  ghanaian and other foreign  federal  state  provincial  territorial and local laws and regulations governing exploration  development  production  exports  taxes  labor standards  waste disposal  protection of the environment  reclamation  historic and cultural resource preservation  mine safety and occupational health  toxic substances  reporting and other matters  as well as accounting standards 
compliance with these laws  regulations and standards or the imposition of new such requirements could adversely affect operating and development costs  the timing of operations and the ability to operate and financial results 
failure to maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our business and share price 
annually  we are required to test our internal controls over financial reporting to satisfy the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of  which requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting 
failure to maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our business and share price 
market risks the market price of our common shares has experienced volatility and could continue to do so in the future 
our common shares are listed on the nyse amex  the toronto stock exchange and the ghana stock exchange 
companies with market capitalizations similar to ours have experienced substantial volatility in the past  often based on factors unrelated to the financial performance or prospects of the companies involved 
these factors include macroeconomic developments in north america and globally and market perceptions of the attractiveness of particular industries 
our share price is also likely to be significantly affected by short term changes in gold prices or in our financial condition or results of operations as reflected in our quarterly earnings reports 
other factors unrelated to our performance that could have an effect on the price of our common shares include the following the extent of analytical coverage available to investors concerning our business could be limited if investment banks with research capabilities do not continue to follow our securities  the trading volume and general market interest in our securities could affect an investor s ability to trade significant numbers of common shares  the size of the public float in our common shares may limit the ability of some institutions to invest in our securities  and a substantial decline in our stock price that persists for a significant period of time could cause our securities to be delisted from nyse amex  the toronto stock exchange and or the ghana stock exchange  further reducing market liquidity 
as a result of any of these factors  the market price of our common shares at any given point in time might not accurately reflect our long term value 
the stock markets in general have recently suffered major declines 
securities class action litigation often has been brought against companies following periods of market price volatility that affects the market price of particular securities without regard to the performance of the company whose stock price is affected 
we could in the future be the target of similar litigation 
securities litigation could result in substantial costs and damages and divert management s attention and resources 
investors could have difficulty or be unable to enforce certain civil liabilities on us  our directors and our experts 
golden star is a canadian corporation 
a majority of our assets are located outside of canada and the united states  and our head office is located in the united states 
it might not be possible for investors to collect judgments obtained in canadian courts predicated on the civil liability provisions of canadian or us securities legislation 
it could also be difficult for investors to effect service of process in connection with any action brought in the united states upon our directors and officers 
execution by united states courts of any judgment obtained against us  or any of the directors or executive officers  in the united states courts would be limited to our assets or the assets of such persons in the united states 
the enforceability in canada of united states judgments or liabilities in original actions in canadian courts predicated solely upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the united states is doubtful 
there are certain us federal income tax risks associated with ownership of golden star common shares 
holders of our common shares or options to purchase our common shares or convertible debentures  referred to as equity securities  who are us taxpayers should consider that we could be considered to be a passive foreign investment company pfic for us federal income tax purposes 
although we believe that we were not a pfic in and do not expect to become a pfic in the foreseeable future  the tests for determining pfic status depend upon a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control  and can be subject to uncertainties  and we cannot assure you that we will not be a pfic 
we undertake no obligation to advise holders of our equity securities as to our pfic status for any year 
if we are a pfic for any year  any person who holds our equity securities who is a us person for us income tax purposes  referred to as a us holder and whose holding period for those equity securities includes any portion of a year in which we are a pfic generally would be subject to a special adverse tax regime in respect of excess distributions 
excess distributions include certain distributions received with respect to pfic shares in a taxable year 
gain recognized by a us holder on a sale or other transfer of our equity securities including certain transfers that would otherwise be tax free also would be treated as an excess distributions 
such excess distributions and gains would be allocated ratably to the us holder s holding period 
for these purposes  the holding period of shares acquired either through an exercise of options or the conversion of convertible debentures includes the holder s holding period in the option or convertible debt 
the portion of any excess distribution including gains treated as excess distributions allocated to the current year would be includible as ordinary income in the current year 
the portion of any excess distribution allocated to prior years would be taxed at the highest marginal rate applicable to ordinary income for each such year regardless of the taxpayer s actual marginal rate for that year and without reduction by any losses or loss carry forwards and would be subject to interest charges to reflect the value of the us income tax deferral 
elections may be available to mitigate the adverse tax rules that apply to pfics the so called qef and mark to market elections  but these elections may accelerate the recognition of taxable income and may result in the recognition of ordinary income 
the qef and mark to market elections are not available to us holders with respect to options to acquire our common shares or convertible debentures 
we have not decided whether we would provide to us holders of our common shares the annual information that would be necessary to make the qef election 
additional special adverse rules also apply to investors who are us holders who own our common shares if we are a pfic and have a non us subsidiary that is also a pfic 
special adverse rules that impact certain estate planning goals could apply to our equity securities if we are a pfic 
the conversion feature of the convertible debentures could limit increases in the trading price of our common shares 
the conversion price of the convertible debentures is and represented a premium over the closing price of our common shares on the nyse amex on february  in the event our share price is greater than the conversion price  this conversion feature may limit the increase in the price of our common shares  since any increase in the stock price above the conversion price will make it more likely that the convertible debentures will be converted  thereby exerting a downward pressure on the market price of the common shares 
the existence of outstanding rights to purchase or acquire common shares could impair our ability to raise capital 
as of february   there were options outstanding to purchase up to  common shares at exercise prices ranging from cdn to cdn per share 
in addition   additional common shares are available for issuance under our stock option plans 
furthermore  million common shares are currently issuable upon conversion of the convertible debentures additional shares may be issuable in certain circumstances 
during the life of the options  convertible debentures and other rights  the holders are given an opportunity to profit from a rise in the market price of common shares  with a resulting dilution in the interest of the other shareholders 
our ability to obtain additional financing during the period such rights are outstanding could be adversely affected  and the existence of the rights could have an adverse effect on the price of our common shares 
the holders of the options  convertible debentures and other rights can be expected to exercise or convert them at a time when we would  in all likelihood  be able to obtain any needed capital by a new offering of securities on terms more favorable than those provided by the outstanding rights 
current global financial conditions may affect our ability to obtain financing and may negatively affect our asset values and results of operations 
global financial conditions during the past three years have been characterized by heightened volatility and uncertainty 
as a result  access to financing has been negatively impacted  which may affect our ability to obtain equity or debt financing in the future on favorable terms 
additionally  these factors  as well as other related factors  may cause decreases in asset values that are deemed to be other than temporary  which may result in impairment losses 
if such increased levels of volatility and market turmoil continue or worsen  our operations could be adversely impacted and the trading price of our common shares may be adversely affected

go cafundo goianesia prospecting liceses held by caystar brasil gsr subsidiary km active exploration stage mining in ghana ghanaian ownership and special rights ghana is situated on the west coast of africa  approximately km north of the equator on the gulf of guinea 
accra  the capital city of ghana  is located almost exactly on the prime meridian 
the former british colony changed its name from the gold coast to ghana on achieving independence on march  ghana is now a republic with a population of approximately million people and a democratically elected government 
english remains the official and commercial language 
the total land area of the country is approximately  square kilometers and the topography is relatively flat 
ghana has a tropical climate with two rainy seasons and two dry seasons each year  particularly in the western region where golden star resources has its two operations 
rights to explore and develop a mine are administered by the minister of lands and natural resources  through the minerals commission  a governmental organization designed to promote and regulate the development of ghana s mineral wealth in accordance with the minerals and mining act of act  which came into effect in march mining act 
a company or individual can apply to the minerals commission for a renewable exploration license granting exclusive rights to explore for a particular mineral in a selected area for an initial period not exceeding three years 
when exploration has successfully delineated a mineral reserve  an application may be made to the minerals commission for conversion to a mining lease  granting a company the right to produce a specific product from the concession area  normally for a period of to years or a lesser period that may be agreed upon with the applicant 
the mining act requires that any person who intends to acquire a controlling share of the equity of any mining company that has been granted a mining lease  must first give notice of its intent to the government and obtain its consent prior to acquiring a controlling share 
under the mining act  the government of ghana holds a free carried interest in all companies that hold mining leases 
the free carried interest entitles the government to a pro rata share of future dividends 
the government has no obligation to contribute development capital or operating expenses 
gsbpl and gswl owe million and million  respectively  to golden star or its subsidiaries as of december   for past advances and interest on these advances  and these amounts would be repaid before payment of any dividends 
under the mining act  the government of ghana is empowered to acquire a special or golden share in any mining company 
the special share would constitute a separate class of shares with such rights as the government and the mining company might agree 
though deemed a preference share  it could be redeemed without any consideration or for a consideration determined by the mining company and payable to the holder on behalf of the government of ghana 
in the absence of such agreement  the special share would have the following rights it would carry no voting rights  but the holder would be entitled to receive notice of and to attend and speak at any general meeting of the members or any separate meeting of the holders of any class of shares  it could only be issued to  held by  or transferred to the government or a person acting on behalf of the government  the written consent of the holder would be required for all amendments to the organizational documents of the company  the voluntary winding up or liquidation of the company or the disposal of any mining lease or the whole or any material part of the assets of the company  it would not confer a right to participate in the dividends  profits or assets of the company or a return of assets in a winding up or liquidation of the company  and the holder of a special share may require the company to redeem the special share at any time for no consideration or for a consideration determined by the company 
gsbpl and gswl have not issued  nor to date been requested to issue  a special share to the government of ghana 
the government of ghana has a pre emptive right to purchase all gold and other minerals produced by mines in ghana 
the purchase price would be agreed by the government of ghana and the mining company  or the price established by any gold hedging arrangement between the company and any third party approved by the government  or the publicly quoted market price prevailing for the minerals or products as delivered at the mine or plant where the right of preemption was exercised 
the government of ghana has agreed to take no preemptive action pursuant to its right to purchase gold or other minerals so long as mining companies sell gold in accordance with certain procedures approved by the bank of ghana 
ghanaian royalty requirements during the first quarter of  the government of ghana amended its mining act to change the method of calculating mineral royalties payable to the government 
the prior rules established a royalty rate of not less than and not more than of a mine s total revenues  the exact amount being determined by each mine s margin as defined in the law 
under the old rules  our mines have  since their inception  qualified for and paid a rate 
the amended law set the royalty at a flat rate of of mineral revenues 
while the new law was initially effective as of as march   we were subsequently notified by the government that the effective date was extended to march  we paid a royalty of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
environmental laws and regulations environmental matters in ghana  including those related to mining  fall under the oversight of the environmental protection agency epa  with some responsibilities lying with the minerals commission 
the epa has rules and guidelines that govern environmental and socioeconomic impact statements  environmental management plans  mine operations  the quality of water discharges to the receiving environment  environmental auditing and review  and mine closure and reclamation  among other matters to which our operations are subject 
additional provisions governing surface uses by our stakeholders are provided in the mining act 
all phases of our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions where we operate 
these regulations may define  among other things  air and water quality standards  waste management requirements  and mine closure and land rehabilitation obligations 
in general  environmental legislation is evolving to require stricter operating standards  more detailed social and environmental assessments of proposed projects  and a heightened degree of responsibility for companies and their officers  directors  and employees for social responsibility and health and safety 
changes in environmental regulations could affect the way we operate  resulting in higher environmental and social operating costs that may affect the viability of our operations 
in ghana  we have noted a trend toward increasing environmental requirements and changes in the way the epa reviews project proposals and operational compliance 
we use hazardous chemicals in our gold recovery activities  and thus generate environmental contaminants that may adversely affect air and water quality 
to mitigate these effects  we have established objectives to achieve regulatory requirements in all of our exploration  development  operation  closure  and post closure activities so that our employees  the local environment and our stakeholder communities are protected and that the post closure land use contributes to the sustainability of the local economy 
in order to meet our objectives  we educate our managers so that they are committed to creating a culture that makes social and environmental matters an integral part of short and long term operations and performance management systems  work with our employees so that they understand and accept environmental and social policies and procedures as a fundamental part of the business  signed and implemented the international cyanide management code and attained certification for the wassa and bogoso prestea operations  signed and publicly stated our support for the un global compact and completed our commitments that are provided in our communications on progress cop  establish  and continue to improve operating standards and procedures that aim to meet or exceed requirements in relevant laws and regulations  the commitments made in our environmental impact statements  environmental and socioeconomic management plans  rehabilitation and closure plans and any international protocols to which we are a signatory  incorporated environmental and human rights performance requirements into all relevant contracts  provide training to employees and contractors in environmental matters  regularly prepare  review  update and implement site specific environmental management and rehabilitation and closure plans  work to progressively rehabilitate disturbed areas in conformance with the site specific environmental management and rehabilitation and closure plans  consult local communities and regulators to provide us with input on our environmental management policies and procedures  regularly review our environmental performance  and publicly report our social  health  safety  and environmental performance 
governmental approvals and permits are currently required  and will likely continue to be required in the future  in connection with our operations and development activities 
to the extent that such approvals are required and not obtained  we could be limited or prohibited from continuing our mining and processing operations or from proceeding with planned exploration or the development of mineral properties 
our mining  processing  development and mineral exploration activities are subject to various laws governing prospecting  development  production  taxes  labor standards  occupational health and safety requirements  land claims of local people and other matters 
new rules and regulations may be enacted or existing rules and regulations may be modified and applied in a manner that could have an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
reclamation activities were ongoing at both wassa hbb and bogoso prestea during to rehabilitate disturbed lands and reduce some of the long term liabilities including re profiling waste dumps  capping hard rock with oxide materials  topsoil spreading and planting for both slope stabilization and long term rehabilitation 
our consolidated reclamation expenditures totaled million  million and million in  and respectively 
the increase in spending reflects backfilling of a pit 
we believe all our operations in ghana are currently in substantial compliance with all environmental requirements 
corporate social responsibility in keeping with our health and safety  environmental  community relations and human rights policies  we strive at all times to conduct our business as a responsible corporate citizen 
we believe our ongoing success in ghana depends on our continuing efforts to build good relations with our local stakeholder communities  and by reviewing broader stakeholder comments and addressing stakeholder concerns in our developing projects and ongoing operations 
we believe our success as an employer  as a neighbor and as an important part of the local economy  is furthered by contributing to the diversification of the local economy with initiatives such as our oil palm project and by our support of community driven improvement projects through our golden star development foundation 
during  the development foundation worked with our local community mine consultation committees to fund and sponsor several community driven projects including an outpatients ward  a medical clinic  continuing scholarships for local students  supplying of medical equipment in partnership with project cure  school buildings and community electrification projects 
our oil palm project continued to advance during and now has over hectares of palm oil trees under cultivation 
we have also provided palm seedlings and other agricultural assistance to a group of local farmers who are developing an additional hectares of palm oil trees on their own farms 
gsr also supports a skills training program for stakeholders aimed at local economic development 
the golden star skills training and employability program gsstep provides practical training for local people in construction and in high tech services such as cell phone repair 
we currently have about graduates who are now able to provide skilled services 
in our efforts to promote transparency in governance  we continue to work with the extractive industry transparency initiative and throughout we published our payments to the government of ghana eg taxes  royalties  fees 
we furthered our work in human rights and against child and forced labor with an extensive training program within golden star and met with our major suppliers to outline our socioeconomic commitments 
our commitment to the development of our stakeholder communities demonstrates golden star s dedication to ghana and to sharing the success of our operations with our local communities 
as we continue to expand our community development programs  we plan to integrate more local people and communities into our economic development and outreach programs  so assisting the western region of ghana to achieve its full potential within the broader ghana development 
operating properties the bogoso prestea gold mine bogoso prestea consists of a gold mining and processing operation located along the ashanti trend in western ghana  approximately kilometers northwest of the town of tarkwa 
it can be reached by paved roads from tarkwa  a local commercial center  and from accra  the capital of ghana 
bogoso and prestea are adjoining mining concessions that together cover approximately kilometers of strike along the southwest trending ashanti gold district 
mining areas at bogoso and prestea are linked to the bogoso processing plants by paved and gravel haul roads located on our properties 
there are two ore processing facilities at bogoso prestea and open pit mining methods are employed 
ore is hauled by truck from the pits to the processing plants 
equipment and facilities include the nominal million tonne per annum bogoso oxide plant  the nominal million tonne per annum bogoso sulfide plant  a fleet of haul trucks  loaders  drills and mining support equipment 
in addition  there are numerous ancillary support facilities including warehouses  maintenance shops  roadways  administrative offices  an employee residential complex  power and water supply systems  a medical clinic  and a tailings storage facility 
we acquired bogoso in and prestea in bogoso prestea gold sales totaled  ounces in and  in see the operating results for bogoso prestea section below for additional details on historical production and operating costs 
in addition to the bogoso prestea complex described above  bogoso prestea assets include the following properties mampon the mampon deposit is located approximately kilometers north of the bogoso sulfide plant 
mampon is an undeveloped gold deposit with  as of december   an estimated million tonnes of probable mineral reserves at an average gold grade of g t  which we plan to mine by open pit mining methods 
it is expected that mampon ore will be hauled by truck to the bogoso processing plants when mining is initiated here 
pampe the pampe deposit is located approximately kilometers west of the bogoso processing plants 
as of december   we have estimated a probable mineral reserve of million tonnes at an average gold grade of g t 
pampe was mined during and but was placed on a care and maintenance until late when limited mining and waste stripping resumed 
we plan to resume mining at pampe before the end of after completing a waste strip program 
the pampe ore will be moved by truck to the bogoso processing plants 
prestea south this property  located km south of the bogoso prestea processing plants  is discussed in more detail below under the development properties section 
prestea underground this property is discussed in more detail below under the exploration stage properties in ghana section 
geology at bogoso prestea bogoso prestea lies within the eburnean tectonic province in the west african precambrian shield along the ashanti trend located immediately south of the town of bogoso 
the area is dominated by a major northeast southwest trending structural fault zone referred to as the ashanti trend  which hosts the prestea  bogoso  obuasi and konongo gold deposits  among others 
parallel to the ashanti trend is the akropong trend  which hosts the ayanfuri deposit 
the akropong trend is about kilometers west of the ashanti trend in the bogoso region 
mineral reserves at bogoso prestea at december   bogoso prestea had proven and probable mineral reserves  including the probable mineral reserves at prestea south  mampon and pampe  of million tonnes grading g t containing approximately million ounces of gold before any reduction for recovery losses and the government of ghana s minority interest 
see the proven and probable mineral reserves table and the non reserves measured and indicated mineral resource table in item of this form k 
operating results for bogoso prestea the following tables show historical operating results bogoso prestea operating results ore mined refractory t ore mined non refractory t total ore mined t waste mined t refractory ore processed t refractory ore grade g t gold recovery refractory ore non refractory ore processed t non refractory ore grade g t gold recovery non refractory ore gold sales oz cash operating cost oz royalties oz total cash cost oz exploration at bogoso prestea during  bogoso prestea area exploration activities focused on drilling vtem geophysical targets and testing extensions of gold mineralization in proximity to the operating pits 
our drilling efforts were rewarded early in the year with the discovery of the buesichem south deposit and our drilling program was re focused on this new discovery 
two multipurpose drill rigs were used over the entire year bringing this resource from the inferred mineral resource category to probable reserves and indicated mineral resource at year end 
in addition to the buesichem south drilling we conducted initial drilling on a structure east of the buesichem trend which will be tested further in vtem drilling in the vicinity of the bogoso north pit has delineated a kilometer zone beneath this pit which requires further follow up in we expect development drilling on the bogoso north  chujah and ablifa pits to be our main focus for bogoso prestea outlook for during we expect that the bogoso sulfide plant will continue to process refractory sulfide ores from the chujah main and bogoso north pits at bogoso prestea 
the bogoso oxide plant may also process sulfide ores  if needed  to maintain optimum sulfide concentrate feed to the bogoso sulfide bio oxidation reactors 
we expect bogoso prestea will produce approximately  to  ounces of gold in at an average cash operating cost between and  per ounce 
the wassa gold mine we own and operate the wassa gold mine located approximately kilometers east of bogoso prestea in southwest ghana 
the property was acquired in from a former owner who had operated wassa as a heap leach gold mine 
the property  as now constituted  includes several open pit mines  the nominal million tonne per annum cil wassa plant with its crushing and grinding circuits  a fleet of mining equipment  a tailings storage facility  ancillary facilities including an administration building  a warehouse  a maintenance shop  a stand by power generating facility and an employee residential complex 
we completed construction of the wassa plant in early  and the plant was placed in commercial service on april  gswl also owns and operates the hwini butre and benso mines located and km  respectively  south of wassa 
in the third quarter of  following completion of a km haul road  we started mining at benso and began hauling its ore to wassa for processing 
in may  following completion of a km road extension  the hwini butre mine began trucking ore to the wassa processing plant 
the benso and hwini butre mines include multiple open pits at both locations as well as mining equipment  equipment repair shops  warehouses and other ancillary support equipment and buildings 
geology at wassa wassa lies within the eburnean tectonic province in the west african precambrian shield 
the proterozoic rocks that comprise most of the west african craton and host the major gold mineralization in ghana are subdivided into meta sedimentary and volcanic rocks of the birimian and tarkwaian sequences 
wassa is hosted within the same birimian volcano sedimentary greenstone package as bogoso prestea 
however  wassa is situated on the southeastern flank of the ashanti belt while bogoso and prestea occur along the northwestern flank 
mineral reserves at wassa as at december   wassa  including the hbb properties  had proven and probable mineral reserves of million tonnes with an average grade of g t containing approximately million ounces of gold before recovery losses and any reduction for the government of ghana s minority interest 
see the proven and probable mineral reserves table and the non reserves measured and indicated mineral resource table in item of this form k 
operating results for wassa the following table displays historical operating results at wassa 
wassa hbb operating results ore mined t waste mined t ore processed t ore grade processed g t recovery gold sales oz cash operating cost oz royalties oz total cash cost oz exploration at wassa hbb exploration activities on the wassa mining lease during focused on ground geophysical surveys and in pit development drilling 
a ground geophysical induced polarization survey was conducted in which outlined anomalous trends south of the main wassa mineralized trend along strike 
following up on the geophysical targets  we initiated first pass drilling which confirmed that the wassa gold mineralized trend continues south of the existing pits 
these southern extensions of the main wassa mineralization are scheduled for further testing in other drilling at wassa in tested higher grade portions of known mineralized zones within our year end measured  indicated and inferred mineral resource pit shells 
this drilling was successful in confirming higher gold grades extended at depth on the  se and b shoot structures 
the new drilling results have been used to update the mineral resource model which was used for the mineral resource and reserve statements 
exploration activities on the hbb concessions during concentrated mainly on deep drilling programs at father brown  adoikrom and subriso west 
the objectives of these programs were to test the extensions at depth of the known zones of high grade gold mineralization to determine whether they have potential for underground exploitation 
a certain number of regional targets were also tested during targets located north of the subriso zones were drilled and have demonstrated that the structures hosting the deposit extend further north 
drilling programs were also conducted south of the adoikrom deposit along a regional structural trend 
mineral resource activities at chichiwelli  south of wassa  involved infill drilling to convert inferred mineral resources to an indicated category 
mineral resource conversion drilling was completed and an updated resource model was estimated 
in addition to the drilling programs  we also conducted a ground based induced polarization geophysical survey which was successful in identifying the known mineralization as well as defining several other trends which we plan to test in wassa hbb outlook for wassa hbb is expected to produce approximately  to  ounces of gold in at an average cash operating cost between and per ounce 
development properties bogoso tailings processing project in the second quarter of  million was approved for construction of a hydraulic tailings recovery system and associated piping that will feed tailings from a decommissioned tailings storage facility to the bogoso oxide plant s cil circuit 
the project is expected to come online in late  subject to permitting 
while the grade of the tailings material is lower than the ores typically treated in the bogoso oxide plant  the operating costs are expected to be low since reclaimed tailings can be fed directly into the existing cil circuit thereby resulting in lower overall processing costs 
the system is designed to handle approximately million tonnes of tailings per annum over its five year life yielding up to approximately  to  additional ounces per year 
engineering has been completed  and permitting and equipment procurement commenced during the fourth quarter of prestea south properties the prestea south project is located on the ashanti trend  southwest of the town of prestea and approximately kilometers southeast of the bogoso processing plants 
gold mineralization is associated with the same ashanti trend fault structure that continues to the north through our bogoso and prestea properties 
while various sections of the mineral resources at prestea south were mined by prior owners using underground methods  the surface oxide mineral resources have not been extensively mined  and there are sulfide mineral resources accessible by open pit mining 
our past exploration efforts have identified several deposits along this trend which can be mined by surface mining methods 
we received mining permits for this area in and subsequently applied for environmental permits 
we expect to initiate development at prestea south  including its kilometer haul road extension  once the environmental permits are received 
the prestea south oxide ore will be transported to bogoso and processed through the bogoso oxide plant 
the prestea south sulfide ore will be processed through the bogoso sulfide plant 
as of december   the prestea south properties had total proven and probable mineral reserves of million tonnes grading g t containing approximately million ounces before any reduction for the government of ghana s minority interest 
exploration properties prestea underground the prestea underground is an inactive underground gold mine located to the south of bogoso and adjacent to the town of prestea 
the property consists of two useable access shafts and extensive underground workings and support facilities 
access to the mine site is via a paved road from tarkwa and accra maintained by the government of ghana 
from the s to when mining ceased following an extended period of low gold prices  the prestea underground operations produced approximately nine million ounces of gold  the second highest production of any mine in ghana 
the underground workings are extensive  reaching depths of approximately  meters and extending along a strike length of approximately nine kilometers 
underground workings can currently be accessed via two surface shafts  one near the town of prestea central shaft and a second approximately four kilometers to the southwest at bondaye 
gsbpl now holds a ownership in the prestea underground with the government of ghana holding a ownership interest in prestea underground as well as its holding in gsbpl  resulting in an beneficial ownership by golden star 
exploration activities at the prestea underground in were limited to desk top reviews  but a new scoping study was completed which evaluated the economic potential of a resumption of underground mining activities 
the study results are now being evaluated 
we continue to dewater the prestea underground  and we are refurbishing the central shaft and assessing services on  and levels 
dewatering and ongoing maintenance costs as included in the statement of operations  totaled approximately million during geology of prestea underground the prestea underground deposits are located along the same ashanti trend structure as are our bogoso deposits a few kilometers to the north and our prestea south deposits a few kilometers to the south with most of the gold mineralization found in a narrow tabular fault zone which dips steeply to the northwest 
akropong trend properties the akropong properties are located along a fault structure which roughly parallels the ashanti trend and is located approximately kilometers to the west of our bogoso sulfide plant 
our exploration programs focused on identifying additional mineral reserve opportunities within truck haulage distance from bogoso prestea 
drilling tested several previously identified auger soil anomalies late in  and this program is continuing into we also started a drilling program designed to test the down dip higher grade portions of the pampe deposit below the current open pit designs 
we also plan to test for potential trend extensions to the north and south of pampe during and to follow up with additional in fill drilling 
dunkwa properties the dunkwa properties  which are located directly north of our bogoso mining lease  consist of two prospecting licenses  mansiso and asikuma  the latter hosting our mampon ore deposit 
the mansiso and asikuma concessions were both part of the vtem airborne geophysical survey 
the chargeability response from this survey has enhanced the understanding of the major structures running through the property  and several new targets have been identified  some of which were explored in we continue to follow up on targets generated by the vtem survey and have designed a drilling program to test the opon east anomaly which we identified in deeper drilling to test the high grade down plunge extension of the mampon deposit has also been budgeted for other exploration stage properties in africa sierra leone during  exploration field activities at our owned sonfon project in sierra leone focused on ground geophysical surveys and diamond drilling testing the high grade zones intersected in the drill holes 
the ground ip geophysical survey conducted in was used to help guide the follow up drilling programs 
in addition to giving direction for the drilling effort  the geophysical survey has generated several other resistive and chargeable targets which could be associated with silicified zones bearing sulfides 
the results of the drilling and ground geophysics analysis will be used to plan field exploration programs in the sonfon project is owned by a joint venture between golden star and african aura mining  with golden star as the majority owner and project manager 
cote d ivoire the exploration programs in cote d ivoire focused on our am lekia and agboville concessions which cover northeast trending structures which extend from the sefwi greenstone belt in ghana 
infill soil sampling program over previously defined soil anomalies on the amelekia and agboville concessions were conducted early in drilling programs originally planned for were rescheduled for  subject to stabilization of the political situation 
these programs are designed to test the soil anomalies defined by our early sampling programs 
burkina faso we hold a beneficial interest in the goulagou and adjoining rounga gold properties  with a local burkina faso partner owning a interest 
the government of burkina faso will receive a statutory carried interest upon the granting of a mining lease 
the two properties are located approximately kilometers west of ouagadougou  the capital city of burkina faso  and kilometers north of the city of ouahigouya 
drilling programs carried out by the prior owner and its predecessors identified several areas of gold mineralization including two parallel zones on the goulagou property the goulagou i and ii deposits 
in october  we granted riverstone resources inc riverstone an option to purchase the goulagou and rounga concessions 
exploration programs in were managed and implemented by riverstone and mainly consisted of infill reverse circulation drilling on the goulagou concession 
we expect that riverstone will continue its exploration efforts and complete the feasibility on the goulagou deposit by late in addition to the goulagou and rounga concessions  golden star holds three other licenses in burkina faso where preliminary reconnaissance work was carried out during deba and tialkam projects  niger our interest in the deba and tialkam gold properties in niger were optioned to ami resources in  which is earning into the properties 
exploration stage properties in south america saramacca property the saramacca property  located in suriname  consists of three concessions totaling approximately square kilometers 
in  newmont earned a interest in the saramacca project by spending million on exploration and has since taken over management of the project 
in november  we entered into an agreement with newmont to sell them our interest in the saramacca joint venture for approximately million 
proceeds of the sale continue to reside in escrow pending the suriname government s transfer of the mineral rights to newmont 
we expect the transfer process to be completed during french guiana activities in french guiana were terminated in mid with the sale of our local french registered subsidiary to auplata  a french guiana gold company  for million 
this sale involved the transfer to auplata all of golden star s rights  titles and interests to the bon espoir  iracoubo sud and paul isnard exploration properties  as well as the entirety of the subsidiary and its assets 
brazil several potential joint venture earn in opportunities were identified and new concessions were staked in northern brazil during we farmed out our sao bartolomeau concessions in minas gerais state to kinross gold corporation in late  and also granted a two year extension to iamgold corporation s current earn in on the alto varginha property also in minas gerais 
golden star has either significant equity sao bartolomeau or royalty rights alta varginha in these two farm outs 
golden star s exploration efforts concentrated on northern mato grosso  where we plan to conduct reconnaissance programs in  evaluating new prospects  as well as looking for potential associations with exploration juniors with strong land positions in the area 
in brazil we have entered into a joint venture with votorantim metals on a  square kilometer land package in northern mato grosso 
this joint venture requires us to spend million to earn of the precious metal rights on this package over a three year period  and additional ownership can be acquired if a project advances to the feasibility stage and we complete a feasibility study 
the initial joint venture work during is anticipated to involve greenfields soil sampling and follow up on several targets generated by the votorantim geophysical and stream sediment data sets as well as initial stream sediment sampling in areas not previously sampled 
we are also seeking high potential farm in or acquisition opportunities in other locations in brazil 
item legal proceedings we are engaged in routine litigation incidental to our business none of which is deemed to be material 
no material legal proceedings  involving us or our business are pending  or  to our knowledge  contemplated  by any governmental authority

performance graph and table the following graph and table illustrates the cumulative total shareholder return on the common shares for the fiscal years ended december   through  together with the total shareholder return of the s p tsx composite index  and the amex gold bugs index for the same period 
the graph and table assumes an initial investment of cdn at december  in golden star common shares and a hypothetical cdn investment in the two associated indices at the same time 
the lines show the change in the value of the initial cdn investment at the end of each of the next five years  allowing an investor to compare golden star s share performed to the performance of the two indices 
because we did not pay dividends on our common shares during the measurement period  the calculation of the cumulative total shareholder return on the common shares does not include dividends

recent sales of unregistered securities no sales of unregistered securities occurred during certain canadian federal income tax considerations the following is a summary of the principal canadian federal income tax considerations that apply to the holding and disposition of our common shares 
this summary only applies to a holder who is for canadian income tax purposes not resident in canada  is resident in the united states of america under the provisions of the canada united states income tax convention the treaty and holds our common shares as capital property 
this summary is based on the current provisions of the income tax act canada and the regulations there under the tax act and all amendments to the tax act publicly proposed by the government of canada to the date hereof 
this summary is also based on the current provisions of the treaty and our understanding of the current publicly available administrative and assessing practices published in writing by the canada revenue agency 
it is assumed that each proposed amendment will be enacted as proposed and there is no other relevant change in any governing law  although no assurance can be given in these respects 
this summary does not otherwise take into account any change in law or administrative practice  whether by judicial  governmental  legislative or administrative action  nor does it take into account provincial  territorial or foreign income tax consequences  which may vary from the canadian federal income tax considerations described herein 
a particular us resident person may not be entitled to benefits under the treaty if the limitations of benefits provisions of the treaty apply to the particular us resident person 
the limitation of benefits provisions under the treaty are complex and us residents are advised to consult their own tax advisors in this regard 
under the treaty members of a limited liability corporation created under the limited liability company legislation in the us and treated as a partnership or disregarded entity under us tax law llc and holders of interests in similarly fiscally transparent us entities may be entitled to benefits under the treaty in certain circumstances provided that the members of the llc are taxed in the united states on any income  profits or gains earned through the llc in the same way they would be if they had earned it directly 
note  the recently concluded fifth protocol to the treaty will affect those shareholders that hold their shares through an llc or other fiscally transparent or hybrid entity 
if you utilize such entities to hold your common shares  then you consult your tax advisors about the impact of the fifth protocol on your holdings 
special rules  which are not discussed in this summary  may apply if you are an insurer carrying on business in canada and elsewhere  or a financial institution as defined by section of the tax act 
if you are in any doubt as to your tax position  you should consult with your tax advisor 
this summary is of a general nature only and it is not intended to be  nor should it be construed to be  legal or tax advice to any holder of the common shares and no representation with respect to canadian federal income tax consequences to any holder of common shares is made herein 
accordingly  shareholders should consult their own tax advisers as to the income and other tax consequences arising in their particular circumstances 
taxation of dividends dividends paid or credited or deemed to be paid or credited by us to a holder of one or more common shares will be subject to canadian non resident withholding tax at the rate of on the gross amount of the dividend 
under the treaty  the rate of withholding tax is reduced to if the holder is the beneficial owner of the dividends or if the holder is a company that owns at least of the company s voting stock and beneficially owns the dividend 
dividends paid to religious  scientific  charitable and similar tax exempt organizations and pension organizations that are resident and exempt from tax in the us and that have complied with the administrative procedures specified in the treaty are exempt from this canadian withholding tax 
taxation of capital gains gains realized by a holder on a sale  disposition or deemed disposition of our common shares  will not be subject to tax under the tax act unless the common shares constitute taxable canadian property within the meaning of the tax act at the time of the sale  disposition or deemed disposition including a deemed disposition upon death of a holder 
our common shares are not taxable canadian property provided that they are listed on a designated stock exchange which includes the tsx  and that neither you nor one or more persons with whom you did not deal at arm s length  alone or together  at any time in the five years immediately preceding the disposition  owned or more of the issued shares of any class or series of our capital stock 
even if our common shares are taxable canadian property to you  under the treaty you will generally be exempt from paying canadian income tax on any gain provided that you are a resident of the united states for the purposes of the treaty and are otherwise eligible for the benefits of the treaty  and further provided that the value of our common share is not derived principally from real property situated in canada 
currently  our common shares do not derive their value principally from real property situated in canada and therefore capital gains realized from the disposition of our common shares would be exempt from tax by virtue of the provisions of the tax treaty  however  the determination as to whether canadian tax would be applicable on a sale  disposition or deemed disposition of common shares must be made at the time of that sale  disposition or deemed disposition 
certain us federal income tax considerations the following discussion is a general summary of the material us federal income tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of our common shares by a holder of our common shares that is an individual resident of the united states or a united states corporation a us holder 
this summary is general in nature and does not address the effects of any state or local taxes  us federal estate  gift  or generation skipping taxes  or the tax consequences in jurisdictions other than the united states 
in addition  this discussion does not discuss all aspects of us federal income taxation that may be relevant to investors subject to special treatment under us federal income tax law including  for example  owners of or more of the voting shares of the company 
you should consult your own advisor regarding the us federal income tax consequences of the acquisition  ownership and disposition of our common shares in light of your particular circumstances 
sale or other disposition of our common shares subject to the passive foreign investment company rules discussed below  a us holder that sells or otherwise disposes of our common shares will recognize capital gain or loss for us federal income tax purposes equal to the difference between i the us dollar value of the amount realized on the sale or disposition and ii the tax basis  determined in us dollars  of those common shares 
if the us holder is an individual  any capital gain generally will be subject to us federal income tax at preferential rates if specified minimum holding periods are met 
long term capital gains of non corporate taxpayers  including individuals  are generally subject to a maximum us federal income tax rate for capital gains recognized in taxable years beginning before january  under current law  long term capital gains of non corporate taxpayers  including individuals  recognized in taxable years beginning after december  will be taxed at a maximum us federal income tax rate of 
the deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations 
distributions we do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future 
however  subject to the passive foreign investment company rules discussed below  a us holder must include in gross income as dividend income the gross amount of any distribution including the amount of any canadian withholding tax thereon paid by the company out of its current or accumulated earnings and profits as determined for us federal income tax purposes with respect to our common stock 
except as described below  dividends received by a non corporate us holder before january  would be taxed at preferential rates as qualified dividend income to such us holder and will generally be subject to a maximum us federal income tax rate 
under current law  dividends received in taxable years beginning after such date will generally be taxed at the same rate as ordinary income 
a distribution on our common stock in excess of current or accumulated earnings and profits will be treated as a tax free return of capital to the extent of the us holder s adjusted basis in such stock thus reducing  but not below zero  the adjusted tax basis of such stock  and thereafter as gain from the sale or exchange of common stock 
see sale or other disposition of our common shares above 
however  dividend income will not be qualified dividend income and will be taxed at ordinary income rates if i the us holder fails to hold the common shares for at least days during the day period beginning days before the ex dividend date  ii the internal revenue service determines that the treaty is not a comprehensive income tax treaty that entitles our dividends to qualified dividend treatment and our common shares are no longer readily tradable on an established securities market in the united states  or iii we are a passive foreign investment company for the taxable year in which the dividend is paid or in the preceding taxable year 
for foreign tax credit limitation purposes  dividends paid by us will be income from sources outside the united states 
subject to various limitations  canadian withholding taxes will be treated as foreign taxes eligible for credit against a us holder s us federal income tax liability 
the limitation on foreign taxes eligible for credit is calculated separately with respect to specific classes of income 
dividend income generally will constitute passive category income  or in the case of certain us holders  general category income 
the use of foreign tax credits is subject to complex conditions and limitations 
in lieu of a credit  a us holder who itemizes deductions may elect to deduct all of such holder s foreign taxes in the taxable year 
a deduction does not reduce us tax on a dollar for dollar basis like a tax credit  but the deduction for foreign taxes is not subject to the same limitations applicable to foreign tax credits 
us holders are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the availability of foreign tax credits 
passive foreign investment company rules a non us corporation will be classified as a passive foreign investment company a pfic in any taxable year in which  after taking into account the income and assets of certain subsidiaries  either i at least of its gross income is passive income  or ii at least of the average value of its assets is attributable to assets that produce or are held for the production of passive income 
whether or not we will be classified as a pfic in any taxable year is a factual determination and will depend upon our assets  the market value of our common shares  and our activities in each year and is therefore subject to change 
although we believe that we were not a pfic for the current tax year and do not expect to become a pfic in the foreseeable future  the tests for determining pfic status depend upon a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control  and can be subject to uncertainties 
accordingly  we cannot assure us holders that we are not or will not be a pfic for this or any future year 
we undertake no obligation to advise us holders of our common shares as to our pfic status for any year 
if we are a pfic for any year  a us holder whose holding period for our common shares includes any portion of a year in which we are a pfic generally would be subject to a special adverse tax regime in respect of excess distributions 
excess distributions include certain distributions received with respect to pfic shares in a taxable year 
gain recognized by a us holder on a sale or other transfer of our common shares including certain transfers that would otherwise be tax free also would be treated as excess distributions 
such excess distributions and gains would be allocated ratably to the us holder s holding period 
for these purposes  the holding period of shares acquired either through an exercise of options or the conversion of convertible debentures includes the us holder s holding period in the option or convertible debenture 
the portion of any excess distribution including gains treated as excess distributions allocated to the current year and to prior years before we first became a pfic would be includible as ordinary income in the current year 
the portion of any excess distribution allocated to all other prior years would be taxed at the highest marginal rate applicable to ordinary income for each such year regardless of the us holder s actual marginal rate for that year and without reduction by any losses or loss carryforwards and would be subject to interest charges 
elections may be available to mitigate the adverse tax rules that apply to pfics the so called qef and mark to market elections  but these elections may accelerate the recognition of taxable income and may result in the recognition of ordinary income 
the qef and mark to market elections are not available to us holders with respect to options to acquire our common shares or convertible debentures 
we have not decided whether we would provide to us holders the annual information that would be necessary to make the qef election 
in addition  dividends received from us are not qualified dividend income if we are a passive foreign investment company for the taxable year in which the dividend is paid or in the preceding taxable year 
if we are a pfic in a taxable year and own shares in another pfic a lower tier pfic  a us holder also will be subject to the excess distribution regime with respect to its indirect ownership of the lower tier pfic 
the mark to market election would not be available for any indirect ownership of a lower tier pfic 
a qef election can be made for a lower tier pfic  but only if we provide the us holder with the financial information necessary to make such an election 
special adverse rules that impact certain estate planning goals could apply to our common shares if we are a pfic 
special rules apply with respect to the calculation of the amount of the foreign tax credit with respect to excess distributions by a pfic 
in general  these rules allocate creditable foreign taxes over the us holder s holding period for common shares and otherwise coordinate the foreign tax credit limitation rules with the pfic rules 
us holders who own common shares during any year in which we are a pfic must file internal revenue service form with their us federal income tax return for each year in which such holder owns our common shares  even if we subsequently would not be considered a pfic 
recently enacted legislation the recently enacted patient protection and affordable care act the ppaca requires certain us holders to pay up to an additional tax on dividends and capital gains for taxable years beginning after december  the ppaca is the subject of a number of constitutional challenges  and at least one court has held that the ppaca is void 
us holders should also consult their tax advisors regarding potential reporting obligations under the hiring incentives to restore employment act  signed into law on march   which provides rules relating to ownership of foreign financial assets or ownership of securities issued by a foreign issuer 
information reporting and backup withholding dividend payments made with respect to shares of our common shares and proceeds from the sale or other disposition of our common shares may be subject to information reporting requirements and to us backup withholding currently at a rate of 
in general  backup withholding will apply with respect to reportable payments made to a us holder unless i the us holder is a corporation or other exempt recipient and  if required  demonstrates such exemption  or ii the us holder furnishes the payor with a taxpayer identification number on internal revenue service form w in the manner required  certifies under penalty of perjury that such us holder is not currently subject to backup withholding and otherwise complies with the backup withholding requirements 
backup withholding is not an additional tax 
rather  the amount of any backup withholding imposed on a payment to a holder will be allowed as a refund or a credit against such holder s us federal income tax liability  provided that the required information is furnished to the internal revenue service

this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes information available to february  non gaap financial measures in this form k  we use the terms total cash cost per ounce and cash operating cost per ounce 
cost of sales as found in our statements of operations  includes all mine site operating costs  including the costs of mining  processing  maintenance  work in process inventory changes  mine site overhead as well as production taxes  royalties  mine site depreciation  depletion  amortization  asset retirement obligation accretion and by product credits  but does not include cost of waste stripping capitalized under betterment waste stripping rules  exploration costs  property holding costs  corporate office general and administrative expenses  impairment charges  corporate business development costs  gains and losses on asset sales  capital gains and losses on foreign currency conversions  interest expense  gains and losses on derivatives  gains and losses on investments and income tax expense benefit 
total cash cost per ounce for a period is equal to cost of sales for the period less mining related depreciation and amortization costs  accretion of asset retirement obligation costs and operations related foreign currency gains and losses for the period  divided by the number of ounces of gold sold during the period 
cash operating cost per ounce for a period is equal to total cash costs for the period less royalties and production taxes  divided by the number of ounces of gold sold during the period 
the following table shows the derivation of these measures for the year ended december  wassa bogoso prestea combined mining operations costs royalties costs to from metals inventory mining related depreciation and amortization accretion of asset retirement obligations cost of sales gaap less royalties less operations related foreign exchange gains losses less mining related depreciation and amortization less accretion of asset retirement obligations cash operating cash cost plus royalties total cash costs ounces sold derivation of cost per ounce measures cash operating cost per ounce total cash cost per ounce for the year ended december  wassa bogoso prestea combined mining operations costs royalties costs to from metals inventory mining related depreciation and amortization accretion of asset retirement obligations cost of sales gaap less royalties less operations related foreign exchange gains less inventory write offs less mining related depreciation and amortization less accretion of asset retirement obligations cash operating cost plus royalties total cash costs ounces sold derivation of cost per ounce measures cash operating cost per ounce total cash cost per ounce we use total cash cost per ounce and cash operating cost per ounce as key operating indicators 
we monitor these measures monthly  comparing each month s values to prior periods values to detect trends that may indicate increases or decreases in operating efficiencies 
these measures are also compared against budget to alert management about trends that may cause actual results to deviate from planned operational results 
we provide these measures to our investors to allow them to also monitor operational efficiencies of our mines 
we calculate these measures for both individual operating units and on a consolidated basis 
total cash cost per ounce and cash operating cost per ounce should be considered as non gaap financial measures as defined in sec regulation s k item and in applicable canadian securities laws and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with gaap 
there are material limitations associated with the use of such non gaap measures 
since these measures do not incorporate revenues  changes in working capital and non operating cash costs  they are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under gaap 
changes in numerous factors including  but not limited to  mining rates  milling rates  gold grade  gold recovery  costs of labor  consumables and mine site general and administrative activities can cause these measures to increase or decrease 
we believe that these measures are the same as  or similar to  the measures of other gold mining companies  but may not be comparable to similarly titled measures in every instance 
trends and events in the twelve months ended december  gold prices gold prices have generally trended upward during the last ten years from a low of per ounce in to a high of  per ounce in november realized gold prices for our shipments averaged  per ounce during  up from per ounce during royalties during the first quarter of  the government of ghana amended its mining act to change the method of calculating mineral royalties payable to the government 
the prior rules established a royalty rate of not less than and not more than of a mine s total revenues  the exact amount being determined by each mine s margin as defined in the law 
under the old rules  our mines have  since their inception  qualified for and paid a rate 
under the amended law  the royalty has been set at a flat rate of of mineral revenues with an effective date of march  in october  we were notified that the effective date was extended to the end of march certain mining companies operating in ghana  including our subsidiaries gsbpl and gswl  operate under tax stabilization agreements which govern  among other things  royalty rates and various tax rules 
discussions with the ministry of finance and economic planning are ongoing to determine the applicability of this new royalty legislation to gsbpl and gswl after march increases in power  fuel and labor rates in ghana we experienced significant upward pressure on the costs of several of our operating consumables during including higher prices for diesel fuel  electricity and processing reagents 
in december  following several months of discussions  the ghanaian national power authority announced an increase in electric power rates which was made retroactive back to june  while our mines had anticipated an increase in power rates and had thus accrued higher power costs since june at the expected new rate  an additional million accrual was required in the fourth quarter to properly reflect the full impact of the new higher than expected rate announced in december 
in january  the government of ghana announced a series of increases in fuel prices which resulted in a total increase over the december level 
adoption of us gaap in golden star has  since its inception  reported to security regulators in both canada and the us using canadian gaap financial statements with a footnote reconciliation to us gaap 
however  a change in sec position in late required that beginning in  canadian companies such as golden star  which do not qualify as foreign private issuers  to file their financial statements in the us using us gaap 
in response  we adopted us gaap for years beginning on or after january  for all future us  ghanaian and canadian regulatory filings 
increase in revolving credit facility in august  our revolving credit facility was amended and restated to reflect changes to the syndicate and to increase the borrowing capacity from million to million 
all other material terms of the facility remain unchanged 
at december   the borrowing capacity on the revolving credit facility decreased by million as was scheduled in the revolving credit facility loan agreement 
expansion of buesichem deposit at bogoso prestea exploration drilling earlier in the year identified a new deposit of gold mineralization  now called buesichem south  located adjacent to our existing buesichem pit at bogoso 
on going drilling after july was successful in converting a large portion of the previously announced mineral resources to proven and probable reserves totaling million tonnes at a grade of grams per tonne as of the end of during the second half of we also identified additional mineral resources at buesichem south  which are in addition to the proven and probable reserves  totaling million tonnes of measured and indicated resources grading grams per tonne and also million tonnes of inferred mineral resources grading grams per tonne 
bogoso has mined ore from the adjacent buesichem pit since producing approximately  ounces of gold to date from this deposit 
cautionary note to us investors concerning estimates of measured  indicated and inferred mineral resources the disclosure immediately above about the new buesichem south resources  uses the terms measured and indicated mineral resources and inferred mineral resources 
us investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of the mineral deposits in these categories will ever be converted into mineral reserves 
inferred mineral resources have a greater amount of uncertainty as to their existence and as to their economic and legal feasibility 
in accordance with canadian rules  estimates of inferred mineral resources cannot form the basis of feasibility or other economic studies 
us investors are cautioned not to assume that part or all of the inferred mineral resource exists  or is economically or legally mineable

results of operations compared to consolidated results consolidated financial results include a net loss of million or per share as compared to net income of million or per share in increased revenues on higher gold prices offset increases in cost of sales yielding a million increase in mine operating margin as compared to but increases in non operating costs and interest during offset the improved mine operating margin yielding a million pre tax loss  down from a million pre tax loss in our consolidated tax expense was million  as compared to a million tax benefit in the benefit was a result of recognizing wassa s deferred tax assets at the end of upon transfer of the hbb mining leases to wassa and improved operational performance at wassa 
the million tax expense in reflects the ongoing use of wassa s tax assets to offset taxable income  and the cost of a temporary tax levy in ghana 
gold sales totaled  ounces in  down from  ounce sold in the major factors contributing to the decrease in gold sold were lower gold recovery at bogoso and lower ore grades at wassa 
realized gold prices averaged  per ounce during  up from per ounce in wassa processed essentially the same tonnes in as in  but ore grades were lower than in as mining moved into lower grade areas of the benso and hwini butre ore bodies during in contrast  bogoso processed higher grade ore during than in  but its gold output was adversely impacted by lower gold recoveries during most of the year 
lower gold recovery at bogoso was related to a change in ore sources during the year 
in and the first quarter of  bogoso s main ore source was fresh ore from deep in the buesichem pit  which yielded good recoveries 
by mid  the buesichem pit was exhausted and bogoso moved its main mining fleet to the chujah main pit where mining in the initial benches encountered partially oxidized ore which yielded lower flotation recovery of the gold 
bogoso initiated mining at the bogoso north pit in october to supplement the chujah main pit ore 
see additional discussion of wassa and bogoso s operations below 
summary of financial results gold sales oz average realized gold price oz revenues in thousands cash flow provided by operations in thousands net income loss in thousands net income loss per share basic our general and administrative expense was million  up million over the level 
the increase was mostly due to higher community development spending in ghana and to higher stock based compensation expense 
the corporate office overhead expense  excluding stock based compensation expense  was up from property holding costs are primarily the costs incurred in care and maintenance activities at the prestea underground project 
an increase in scheduled accretion of the convertible debentures was the major factor contributing to the increase in interest expense 
bogoso prestea operations compared to bogoso prestea gold shipments totaled  ounces in at an average gold price of  per ounce  down from  ounces in at an average price of per ounce 
while plant feed grades and total tonnes processed were marginally higher in  a drop in gold recovery resulted in lower gold output 
the drop in refractory ore gold recovery to in from in was related to a change in ore sources during the year 
in and the first quarter of  bogoso s main feed source was fresh ore from deep in the buesichem pit which yielded good recoveries 
but by mid  the buesichem pit was exhausted and bogoso moved its main mining fleet to the chujah main pit where mining encountered partially oxidized ore at shallow levels resulting in lower flotation recovery of the gold 
bogoso also processed stockpiled transition ores at various time late in  which also contributed to lower gold recovery rates 
the bogoso north pit was opened in the fourth quarter of to provide additional ore 
unusually heavy rain fall in the second half of and dewatering issues impeded mining operations and pit scheduling at both chujah and bogoso north 
the bogoso sulfide plant processed refractory ore throughout the year  and in various periods the oxide plant was operated to provide additional refractory concentrate to the bio oxidation circuit 
in the fourth quarter of  the oxide plant processed oxide ore from a small stockpile accumulated from sundry sources over the past few quarters 
mining was temporarily reinitiated at the pampe pit km west of bogoso in the fourth quarter of we expect that resumption of oxide ore mining from pampe and the new tailings reprocessing project at bogoso  assuming permits are received  should allow extended periods of oxide ore processing at the bogoso oxide plant starting late in bogoso prestea operating results ore mined refractory t ore mined non refractory t total ore mined t waste mined t refractory ore processed t refractory ore grade g t gold recovery refractory ore non refractory ore processed t non refractory ore grade g t gold recovery non refractory ore gold sales oz cash operating cost oz royalties oz total cash cost oz bogoso prestea s cash operating costs totaled million in  up from million in higher electric power  fuel  cyanide and labor costs were the key items responsible for bogoso s cost increase 
higher cash operating costs coupled with lower gold output pushed cash operating costs to per ounce  up from per ounce in bogoso expects to see improved gold recovery during as mining at the chujah main accesses fresher ore at deeper levels in the pit and as more ore comes from the bogoso north pit 
at the same time we continue efforts to increase recovery and plant throughput at the bogoso sulfide plant while seeking ways to reduce bogoso s over all cost structure 
bogoso s major capital expenditures will include development work at the dumasi pit  additional reserve drilling and completion of the tailings processing project 
as explained in item business above  bogoso added a net million ounces of new proven and probable reserves during  bringing the year end reserves to million tonnes at an average grade of g t  or million ounces before recovery losses 
the prestea underground mine remained on a care and maintenance basis during  and dewatering continued 
a scoping study evaluating the operational and economic potential of an underground mining operation was updated during the current portion of bogoso s asset retirement obligation increased in due to the need to back fill the plant north pit at prestea  and to rehabilitate the associated waste rock dump site 
these two items are expected to cost approximately million during wassa hbb operations compared to while wassa processed essentially the same number of tonnes of ore in as it did in  ore grades and gold recovery were lower resulting in lower gold sales 
in addition  wassa experienced increases in its cash operating costs  the effects of which were offset by higher gold prices 
wassa sold  ounces in at an average realized gold price of  per ounce as compared to  ounces at an average realized price of per ounce in lower plant feed grade in reflected a transition of mining into lower grade areas of the benso and hwini butre pits during mining is now ramping up at hwini butre  and by mid  we expect to begin mining at the high grade father brown deposit  sending the ore to wassa for processing 
wassa hbb operating results ore mined t waste mined t ore processed t ore grade processed g t recovery gold sales oz cash operating cost oz royalties oz total cash cost oz cash operating costs rose to million in  up from million in increases in labor  fuel  explosives and electric power accounted for most of the increase over levels 
also  as wassa ramped up its mining effort at benso and hwini butre during  it incurred higher costs for contract mining  ore haulage costs and equipment rental than in wassa hbb moved a total of million tonnes of ore and waste in  as compared to million tonnes in the higher cash costs and lower gold sales contributed to a cash operating cost of per ounce in  as compared to per ounce in lower gold production resulted in lower depreciation and amortization costs which were down million from results of operations compared to consolidated results our consolidated net income totaled million or per share for as compared to a net loss of million or per share  in the significant earnings improvement  as compared to  was largely related to a million improvement in mine operating margins which was the result of a  or  ounce increase in gold sales and a per ounce increase in average realized gold price 
an million increase in tax benefits and million reduction in impairment losses also contributed to the earnings improvement from a million increase in cost of sales partially offset the improvements in gold sales and gold price 
bogoso s gold sales improved by  or  ounces  mostly due to improved gold recoveries 
higher grade ores during from wassa s new hwini butre and benso mines hbb properties yielded a  or  ounce increase in wassa s gold sales 
these higher ounces combined with the gold price improvements resulted in a increase in gold revenues over levels 
bogoso s cost of sales declined from levels  but the extra costs associated with the new hbb mining operations resulted in increases in wassa s cost of sales  resulting in our overall increase in cost of sales 
transfer of the hbb mining leases to wassa in and improved operational performance at wassa  which allowed release of deferred tax asset valuation allowances  provided the tax benefit 
our general and administrative expense was down million reflecting lower legal and tax audit costs than in and the cost cutting programs implemented in early property holding costs are mostly the costs incurred in care and maintenance activities at the prestea underground which was deemed impaired and written off at the end of higher derivative costs reflect the increased use of gold price derivatives during as compared to most of the increase in interest expense was related to scheduled increases in accretion of the convertible debentures equity component 
bogoso prestea operations compared to bogoso prestea gold shipments increased to  ounces in at an average price of per ounce  up from  ounces in at an average price of per ounce 
the increase in gold recovery to in from in was the major factor in the gold sales improvement 
while the bogoso oxide plant processed refractory ore at various times during  there was no non refractory ore processed at bogoso during the year 
oxide ore mining remained on stand by at pampe awaiting receipt of permits for prestea south 
once prestea south permits are issued  we expect to mine oxide ore from both pampe and prestea south in amounts sufficient to run the bogoso oxide mill at capacity 
bogoso prestea operations resulted in a million operating margin loss  an improvement from its million operating margin loss in cash operating costs fell from million in to million in on lower fuel  power and consumable costs 
lower cash operating costs coupled with increases in gold output resulted in an improvement in unit costs to per ounce  down from per ounce in the prestea underground mine remained on a care and maintenance basis during  and dewatering continued as we evaluated various plans that could allow underground mining to restart 
wassa operations compared to wassa mining operations underwent significant changes during due to the impact of its two new mining operations at benso and hwini butre located and kilometers south of wassa  respectively 
both of these ore bodies are much higher grade than the pits located adjacent to the wassa plant site which have furnished ore to the wassa plant since as a result of the new ores from benso and hwini butre during  wassa saw higher ore grades  increased gold sales  better gold recoveries and lower costs per ounce 
with the new hbb ores  wassa s plant feed grade averaged grams per tonne during as compared to grams per tonne in total tonnes processed during were lower than in  but gold recovery increased to  up from in tonnes processed were lower as wassa cut back on processing low grade heap leach material to maximize ore residence time in the plant to achieve higher recovery from the higher grade hbb ores 
development projects bogoso tailings processing project in the second quarter of  million was approved for construction of a hydraulic tailings recovery system and associated piping that will feed tailings from a decommissioned tailings storage facility to the bogoso oxide plant s cil circuit 
the project is expected to come online in late  subject to permitting 
while the grade of the tailings material is lower than the ores typically treated in the bogoso oxide plant  the operating costs are expected to be low since reclaimed tailings can be fed directly into the existing cil circuit thereby resulting in lower overall processing costs 
the system is designed to handle approximately million tonnes of tailings per annum over its five year life yielding up to approximately  to  additional ounces per year 
engineering has been completed  and permitting and equipment procurement commenced during the fourth quarter of prestea south properties we received mining permits for prestea south in and continue to work on the environmental permits 
we expect to initiate development at prestea south  including its kilometer haul road extension  once the environmental permit is received 
the prestea south oxide ore will be transported to bogoso and processed through the bogoso oxide plant 
the prestea south sulfide ore will be processed through the bogoso sulfide plant 
the ghana environmental protection agency epa has requested an update to the prestea south project environmental impact statement eis 
we are currently working with our environmental consultant to finalize the study and expect that the revised eis will be submitted in the first quarter of exploration projects exploration expenditures in totaled approximately million  up from million in the exploration programs concentrated on converting resources to reserves at wassa  hwini butre  benso  chichiwelli  pampe and buesichem south and on further vtem geophysical target drilling at bogoso and prestea 
other west african exploration activities included drilling at our burkina faso properties by a joint venture partner  initial drilling on the niger properties by another joint venture partner who is earning into the deba and tialkam licenses  infill soil sampling on the cote d ivoire properties at amelekia  abengorou and agboville  and further diamond drilling and geophysics at the sonfon joint venture in sierra leone 
in south america  exploration efforts concentrated on our brazilian properties where we have entered into a joint venture to earn an ownership position in a large package of properties in northern mato grosso state as well as initial soil sampling and prospecting on our held ground in mato grosso  goias and minas geris states 
in we sold our interest in the saramacca property in suriname to newmont mining corporation and are now awaiting the government s transfer of the properties to newmont 
when the transfer is completed we will receive the million purchase price which is currently being held in escrow 
all of our french guiana assets were sold in exploration plans we have budgeted approximately million for exploration activities in  and plan to focus efforts on resource definition drilling in and around our mining leases in ghana  testing deeper potential underground targets below higher grade portions of the current open pits and drilling of geophysical targets at bogoso prestea  wassa  hwini butre and benso 
we expect that the west african exploration programs outside of ghana will involve continued drilling and assessment of the burkina faso and niger properties undertaken by joint venture partners as well as initial drilling of geochemical targets in cote d ivoire and additional drilling on the sonfon joint venture in sierra leone 
we expect to step up the level of exploration activity in south america during  especially in brazil where we have entered into a joint venture with votorantim metals on a  square kilometer land package in northern mato grosso 
this joint venture requires us to spend million to earn of the precious metal rights on this package over a three year period and additional ownership can be acquired if a project advances to the feasibility stage and we complete a feasibility study 
the initial joint venture work during is anticipated to involve greenfields soil sampling and follow up on several targets generated by the votorantim geophysical and stream sediment data sets as well as initial stream sediment sampling in areas not previously sampled 
in addition to exploration on the joint venture properties  we plan to conduct further soil and stream sampling on our owned land holdings in mato grosso  goias and minas geris states 
in suriname we will continue to assist newmont with the transfer of the saramacca joint venture properties 
liquidity and capital resources during  our cash and cash equivalents increased by million  reaching million at december  the increase in cash was a function of the million of cash generated from operating activities during operating cash flow of million in was million higher than the million in and was sufficient to meet all of our operational  investing and debt needs 
cash flow from changes in working capital was the major factor contributing to the cash flow improvement over our capital projects used million of cash during  up from million in capital projects used the following amounts during million for mine development projects  million for purchases of capital equipment  million for deferred waste stripping  and million for mine site exploration and drilling 
outstanding debt decreased by million during reflecting reduction in the equipment financing loans balance 
while there were million of new equipment loans during  million of scheduled payments yielded a net reduction of million 
non cash accretion raised the convertible debenture balance by million to million during continuing periodic accretion fees will bring the convertible debenture balance to its million face amount by its november  due date 
the million opening balance on our revolving credit facility was paid during leaving a nil balance as the end of and the balance on the capital leases was reduced to million by period payments during our million equipment financing facility had an outstanding balance of million at december   with available credit of million 
our revolving credit facility ended the year with no outstanding balance and million of available credit 
see note to the attached financial statements for a table of schedule future debt payments 
we were in compliance with all loan covenants at december  during  all of our cash and cash equivalents were held as cash or was invested in funds that held only us treasury notes and bonds 
liquidity outlook our liquidity position improved in as cash balances continued to grow  reaching million at december   up from million at the end of and million at the end of a total of million of cash flow from operating activities during was the major factor contributing to the increase 
in addition to the improved cash balances  we maintain a million revolving line of credit and have an additional million of borrowing capacity under our equipment financing credit facility 
we also have a shelf registration statement on file with the us securities and exchange commission which enables golden star to issue common shares  preferred shares  debt securities and warrants from time to time 
we expect to use approximately million for capital projects during this total is expected to include million of mine property development  million of mine site drilling and approximately million for equipment and facilities 
during  we expect to pay million of principal and interest on our equipment financing facility  million of interest payments on the convertible debentures and million in interest and principal of our capital leases 
operational cash flow in  along with the revolving credit facility and equipment financing facility  should be sufficient to cover capital and operating needs during looking ahead our main objectives for are permitting  development and operation of a tailings recovery process at bogoso to provide feed to the bogoso oxide plant  optimize and stabilize ore feed at bogoso to improve metallurgical recoveries  continue reserve and resource definition drilling at bogoso prestea and wassa hbb  reopen the pampe pit to provide oxide ore to the bogoso oxide processing plant  finalization of the permitting and development of the prestea south project  and advance the development of the prestea underground 
we are estimating bogoso prestea gold production of  to  ounces at an average cash operating cost of to  per ounce 
we expect wassa to produce approximately  to  ounces during at an average cash operating cost of to per ounce  with combined total production of approximately  to  ounces at an average cash operating cost of to per ounce 
as more fully disclosed in the risk factors in item a of this form k  numerous factors could cause our estimates and expectations to be wrong or could lead to changes in our plans 
under any of these circumstances  the estimates described above could change materially 
environmental laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions where we operate  all phases of our exploration  project development  and operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations 
these laws and regulations may define  among other things  air and water quality standards  waste management requirements  and closure and rehabilitation obligations 
in general  environmental legislation is evolving to require more strict operating standards  more detailed socioeconomic and environmental impact assessments of proposed projects  and a heightened degree of responsibility for companies and their officers  directors  and employees for corporate social responsibility  and health and safety 
changes in environmental regulations  and the way they are interpreted by the regulatory authorities  could affect the way we operate  resulting in higher environmental and social operating costs that may affect the viability of our operations 
we note a continuing trend toward substantially increasing environmental requirements and greater corporate social responsibility expectations in ghana 
this includes the need for more permits  analysis  data gathering  community hearings and negotiations than have been required in the past to resolve both routine operational needs and for new development projects 
in ghana  the trend to longer lead times in obtaining environmental permits has continued such that we are no longer able to estimate permitting times 
these increases in permitting requirements could affect our environmental management activities including but not limited to tailings disposal facilities and water management projects at our mines 
socio economic development projects as part of our commitment to corporate social responsibility  we support and fund the golden star development foundation and the golden star oil palm plantations limited gsopp 
both these entities aim to improve the standard of living and diversify the economic base within our stakeholder communities by sharing our success with our stakeholders 
funding for each of the projects is ounce of gold produced plus of pre tax profits 
the golden star development foundation funds primarily infrastructure projects eg schools and clinics  that are selected by stakeholder consultative committees 
in this manner  we are able to support projects selected by our communities 
the gsopp is developing oil palm plantations on disturbed lands and then assigns smallholdings to local farmers who then tend the oil palms 
each smallholder receives support from gsopp and also receives money from the sale of the palm fruit 
to date  hectares have been planted and plots of producing trees have been assigned to local farmers including at our new project near hwini butre 
we have also assisted farmers develop hectares of palm plantations on their own farms 
related party transactions we obtained legal services from a legal firm to which one of our board members is of counsel 
the total value of all services purchased from this law firm during and was million and million  respectively 
our board member did not personally perform any legal services for us during the period nor did he benefit directly or indirectly from payments for the services performed by the firm 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements reflect the application of cdn gaap  which is different in certain material respects from us gaap 
the accounting policies reflected therein are generally those applied by similarly situated mining companies in canada 
our accounting policies under cdn gaap are described in note of our consolidated financial statements 
preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that can affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
accounting policies relating to asset impairments  depreciation and amortization of mining property  plant and equipment  stock based compensation  tax assets  determination of fair values of financial instruments and site reclamation closure accruals are subject to estimates and assumptions regarding reserves  gold recoveries  future gold prices  future operating and reclamation costs and future mining activities 
decisions to write off  or not to write off  all or a portion of our investment in various properties  especially exploration properties subject to impairment analysis  are based on our judgment as to the actual value of the properties and are therefore subjective in most cases 
certain exploration properties have been found to be impaired in the past and were written off in prior years 
we continue to retain title to certain properties after impairment write offs as future events and discoveries may ultimately prove that they have value 
listed below are the accounting policies and estimates that we believe are critical to our financial statements based on the degree of uncertainty regarding the estimates or assumptions involved and the magnitude of the asset  liability  revenue or expense being reported 
ore stockpiles stockpiles represent coarse ore that has been extracted from the mine and is available for further processing 
stockpiles are measured by physical surveys or by estimating the number of tonnes of ore added and removed from the stockpile during a period 
the number of recoverable ounces of gold in stockpiles is based on assay data and the gold recovery rate expected when the ore is processed 
stockpile values include mining and mine maintenances costs incurred in bringing the ore to the stockpile  and also a share of direct overhead and applicable depreciation  depletion and amortization relating to mining operations 
costs are added to a stockpile based on current mining costs and are removed at the average cost per tonne of the total stockpile 
stockpiles are reduced as material is removed and fed to the processing plant 
a adjustment of a typical stockpile value would change the carrying value of the stockpile inventory by approximately million 
impairment charges we periodically review and evaluate our long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable from continued operation of the asset 
an asset impairment is considered to exist if the sum of all estimated future cash flows  on an undiscounted basis  are less than the carrying value of the long lived asset 
the determination of expected future cash flows requires numerous estimates about the future  including gold prices  operating costs  production levels  gold recovery rates  reclamation spending  ore reserves  amounts of recoverable gold and capital expenditures 
amortization capital expenditures for mining properties  mine development and certain property plant and equipment items  are amortized using a units of production method over proven and probable mineral reserve ounces of gold 
capital expenditures that benefit an entire mining property  such as the cost of building an administrative facility  are amortized over all ounces contained on the property 
capital expenditures that benefit only a specific asset such as the pre production stripping costs of a pit  are amortized over only the ounces located in the associated pit 
reserve estimates  which serve as the denominator in units of production amortization calculations  involve the exercise of subjective judgment and are based on numerous assumptions about future operating costs  future gold prices  continuity of mineralization  future gold recovery rates  spatial configuration of gold deposits  and other factors that may prove to be incorrect 
a adjustment in estimated total december   reserves at wassa and at bogoso prestea could result in an approximately million annual change in amortization expense 
tax assets recognition of future tax assets requires an analysis of future taxable income expectations to evaluate the probability of sufficient future taxable income to utilize the accrued tax benefits 
determination of expected future taxable income requires numerous estimates of future variable including but not limited to  gold prices  operating costs  gold recovery  ore reserves  gold production  ore grades  administrative costs  tax rates  and potential changes in tax laws 
asset retirement obligation and reclamation expenditures accounting for future reclamation obligations requires management to make estimates  at each mine site  of future reclamation and closure costs 
in many cases a majority of such costs are incurred at the end of a mine s life which can be several years in the future 
such estimates are subject to changes in mine plans  reclamation requirements  inflation rates and technology 
as a result  future reclamation and closure costs are difficult to estimate 
our estimates of future reclamation and closing cost are reviewed frequently and are adjusted as needed to reflect new information about the timing and expected future costs of our environmental disturbances 
based upon our current situation  we estimate that a increases in total future reclamation and closure cash costs would result in an approximately million increase in our asset retirement obligations 
accounting developments see note to the financial statements attached below this management s discussion and analysis of consolidated financial condition and results of operations for a discussion of recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements 
adoption of us gaap in golden star has  since its inception  reported to security regulators in both canada and the us using canadian gaap financial statements with a foot note reconciliation to us gaap 
however  a change in sec position in late required that after  canadian companies such as golden star  which do not qualify as foreign private issuers  file their financial statements in the us using us gaap after in response  we adopted us gaap for years beginning on or after january  for all future us  ghanaian and canadian regulatory filings 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
table of contractual obligations payment due in millions by period total less than year to years to years more than years debt interest on long term debt operating lease obligations capital lease obligations asset retirement obligations total includes million of convertible debentures maturing in november golden star has the right to repay the million in cash or in common shares at the due date under certain circumstances 
the presentation shown above assumes payment is made in cash and also assumes no conversions of the debt to common shares by the holders prior to the maturity date 
asset retirement obligations include estimates about future reclamation costs  mining schedules  timing of the performance of reclamation work and the quantity of ore reserves  an analysis of which determines the ultimate closure date and impacts the discounted amounts of future asset retirement liabilities 
the discounted value of these projected cash flows is recorded as asset retirement obligations on the balance sheet of million as of december  the amounts shown above are undiscounted to show full expected cash requirements 
outstanding share data this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes information available to february  as of february   we had outstanding  common shares  options to acquire  common shares  and convertible notes which are convertible into  common shares 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk includes  but is not limited to  the following risks changes in interest rates on our debt  changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity price fluctuations 
interest rate risk interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates 
our convertible senior unsecured debentures and the outstanding loans under our equipment financing facility bear interest at a fixed rate and are not subject to gains or losses in interest rate 
our revolving credit facility has a variable interest rate of the higher of the applicable lender s cost of funds capped at per annum above libor and libor plus a margin of 
as of december   we had a nil balance outstanding on this facility 
we have not entered into any agreements to hedge against unfavorable changes in interest rates  but may in the future actively manage our exposure to interest rate risk 
foreign currency exchange rate risk currency risk is risk that the fair value of future cash flows will fluctuate because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition  the value of cash and cash equivalents and other financial assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies can fluctuates with changes in currency exchange rates 
since our revenues are denominated in us dollars and our operating units transact much of their business in us dollars  we are typically not subject to significant impacts from currency fluctuations 
even thus  certain purchases of labor  operating supplies and capital assets are denominated in ghana cedis  euros  british pounds  australian dollars and south african rand 
to accommodate these purchases  we maintain operating cash accounts in non us dollar currencies and appreciation of these non us dollar currencies against the us dollar results in a foreign currency gain and a decrease in non us dollar currencies results in a loss 
in the past we have entered into forward purchase contracts for south african rand  euros and other currencies to hedge expected purchase costs of capital assets 
during and we had no currency related derivatives 
at december   and we held million and million  respectively  of foreign currency 
commodity price risk gold is our primary product and  as a result  changes in the price of gold significantly affects our results of operations and cash flows 
based on our expected gold production in  a per ounce change in gold price would result in a to million change in our sales revenues and operating cash flows 
to reduce gold price volatility  we have at various times entered into gold price derivatives 
at december   and december   we did not hold any gold price derivatives and thus  there were no financial instruments subject to gold price risk at december  information about our gold price derivative activity can be found in note of our financial statements 
in january  we entered into a series of put and call contracts covering  ounces of future gold production between february and december the contracts are spread evenly in each week over this period and are structured as cashless collars with a floor of  per ounce and a cap of  per ounce 
in early february we entered into a second set of put and call contracts covering  ounces of future gold production between february and december the contacts are spread evenly in each week during this period and are structured as cashless collars with a floor of  per ounce and a cap of  per ounce
