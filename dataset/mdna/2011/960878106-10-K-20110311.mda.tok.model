item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements and estimates that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
factors that could cause or contribute to differences from estimates include those discussed under cautionary note regarding forward looking statements and risk factors contained in item above 
overview westmoreland coal company is an energy company employing  employees whose operations include five surface coal mines in montana  north dakota and texas and two coal fired power generating units with a total capacity of approximately megawatts in north carolina 
we sold million tons of coal in our two principal operating segments are our coal segment and our power segment  in addition to two non operating segments 
we are a holding company and conduct our operations through subsidiaries  which generally have obtained separate financing 
as a holding company  we have significant cash requirements to fund our ongoing heritage health benefit costs  pension contributions  and corporate overhead expenses 
the principal sources of cash flow to us are distributions from our principal operating subsidiaries 
following the parent notes offering discussed below  we now have cash on hand in excess of million 
the parent notes offering permits us to enter into a revolving credit facility at the parent 
recent developments in february  we completed a private placement of million of senior secured notes due in the net proceeds from the offering of the parent notes were used to pay all dividend arrearages on our series a preferred stock  to repay all outstanding term and revolving line of credit debt at rova and wri  to retire approximately million of the outstanding principal owed on the senior secured convertible notes the remaining principal balance of the senior secured convertible notes was converted to common stock and for general corporate purposes 
we are required to register the debt issued under the parent notes offering with the sec within days after the completion of the offering  which was february  legislation enacted on july   president obama signed into law the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act 
the legislation  among other matters  requires mining companies to provide specific detailed information on health and safety violations on a mine by mine basis  and will require disclosure of payments made to foreign governments and the federal government to further the commercial development of minerals 
we have made the required health and safety violation disclosures in part i  item b mine safety disclosure 
regulations regarding government payment disclosures have not yet been adopted 
healthcare reform in march  the patient protection and affordable care act  or ppaca was enacted  potentially impacting our costs to provide healthcare benefits to our active and retired employees and benefits related to black lung 
the ppaca has both short term and long term implications on healthcare benefit plan standards 
implementation of this legislation is planned to occur in phases  with plan standard changes taking effect beginning in  but to a greater extent with the benefit plan year and extending through beginning in  the ppaca will impose a excise tax on employers to the extent that the value of their healthcare plan coverage exceeds certain dollar thresholds 
as a result  we have increased our postretirement medical benefit obligation at december  by million with a corresponding increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
the ppaca reduces the tax benefits available to an employer that receives the medicare part d subsidy beginning in years ending after december  as a result of the ppaca  employers that receive the medicare part d subsidy will recognize the deferred tax effects of the reduced deductibility of the postretirement prescription drug coverage in the period in which the ppaca was enacted 
also in march  a companion bill  the reconciliation act  was signed into law 
the reconciliation act reduces the effect of the ppaca on affected employers by deferring for two years until years ending after december  the reduced deductibility of the postretirement prescription drug coverage 
accounting for income taxes requires that the effect of adjusting the deferred tax asset for the elimination of this deduction be included in income from continuing operations 
however  entities that have a full valuation allowance for this deferred tax asset would recognize a related decrease in the valuation allowance 
as we have a full valuation allowance against the related deferred tax asset  this change in tax law regarding the medicare part d subsidy will not have an effect on our income from continuing operations 
in addition  this change in the tax deduction does not affect the pre tax expense or corresponding liability for postretirement prescription drug benefits 

table of contents the ppaca also amended previous legislation related to black lung disease  providing automatic extension of awarded lifetime benefits to surviving spouses and providing changes to the legal criteria used to assess and award claims 
since the legislation passed on march   we have experienced a significant increase in claims filed compared to the corresponding period in prior years 
however  we have not been able to determine what  if any  additional impact may result from these claims due to lack of claims experience under the new legislation and court rulings interpreting the new provisions 
we will continue to evaluate the impact of the ppaca in future periods as additional information  interpretations  guidance and claims experience becomes available 
results of operations items that affect comparability of our results for and each of the prior two years  our results have included items that do not relate directly to ongoing operations 
the income expense components of these items were as follows year ended december  in thousands fair value adjustment on derivative and related amortization of debt discount heritage legal claim settlement reclamation claim beneficial conversion feature interest expense loss on extinguishment of wml debt loss on extinguishment of rova debt settlement of coal royalty dispute gain on sale of interest in ft

we recorded a gain of million related to a settlement of past heritage claims  as a result of efforts to reduce our heritage costs 
we recorded million in net expense related to the settlement of the reclamation claim at our rosebud mine 
this included a million reduction in revenue  offset with a million reduction in cost of sales 

table of contents items recorded in we recorded million of expense related to the beneficial conversion feature in the convertible notes we issued in march  as the conversion price was lower than the fair market value of our common stock at the time of issuance 
we refinanced both our wml and rova debt during and as a result recorded losses of million and million  respectively  for the extinguishment of debt 
we recorded million in net expense related to two coal royalty claims as we reached an agreement with the us minerals management service and the montana department of revenue to settle two long standing disputes 
this included million of cost of sales  offset with million of revenue 
on july   we received million for our royalty interest in the gas fired ft 
lupton project and recognized a gain of million on the sale 
in  we initiated a restructuring plan in order to reduce the overall cost structure of the company 
as a result  in we recorded restructuring charges of million 
most of the restructuring charges related to termination benefits  outplacement costs  and lease costs related to the consolidation of corporate office space 
compared to summary our revenues for increased to million compared with million in this increase was primarily driven by a million increase in our coal segment revenues due to price increases under existing coal supply agreements and the commencement of new agreements including the new cost plus contract with our rosebud mine s unit buyers 
additionally in  we experienced customer shutdowns at our rosebud and beulah mines  whereas comparable shutdowns did not occur during we refer to these shutdowns as the customer shutdowns 
in addition  our power segment revenues increased million related to an increase in megawatt hours sold as a result of a planned major maintenance outage  which occurs every five years  and a significant unplanned outage  both of which occurred in no comparable outages occurred in

our coal segment revenues for increased to million compared with million in this million increase occurred primarily from the million increase in tons sold due to the customer shutdowns  price increases under existing coal supply agreements  and the start of new agreements including the new cost plus contract with our rosebud mine s unit buyers 
our coal segment operating income increased to million in compared to million in excluding the million related to the reclamation claim discussed in items that affect comparability of our results  our coal segment operating income increased by million 
this increase was primarily driven by the factors increasing revenue described above as well as strong cost management performance by several of our mines

this decrease was primarily due to the agreement we entered into to modernize how we provide prescription drug benefits to our retirees 
in addition  while we continue to work towards further heritage cost reductions  selling and administrative costs decreased due to reduced cost containment expenses 
finally  we experienced a favorable change in the valuation of our black lung liabilities due to changes in discount rates

our income tax benefit was million in compared with million in excluding the million tax effect of other comprehensive income gains discussed in items that affect comparability of our results  our income tax benefit remained consistent with our net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest in was million compared to million in this increase was due to an increase in the noncontrolling interest adjustment to reduce losses from a partially owned consolidated coal segment subsidiary 
compared to summary our revenues for decreased to million compared with million in this decrease was primarily driven by a million decrease in our coal segment revenues  which includes approximately million as a result of reduced tonnages sold due to the customer outages and unfavorable current energy market conditions  approximately million of revenue reversed related to a reclamation claim  and approximately million of revenue recognized related to the settlement of coal royalty claims 
in addition  our power segment revenues decreased million related to a decrease in megawatt hours sold 
our net loss applicable to common shareholders for decreased to million compared with a million loss in excluding million of income in and the million of expenses in discussed in items that affect comparability of our results  our net loss increased by million

table of contents reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net loss the discussion in results of operations in  and includes references to our adjusted ebitda results 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda are supplemental measures of financial performance that are not required by  or presented in accordance with  gaap 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda are key metrics used by us to assess our operating performance and we believe that ebitda and adjusted ebitda are useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because these measures are used widely by investors to measure a company s operating performance without regard to items excluded from the calculation of such terms  which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and book value of assets  capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired  among other factors  and help investors to more meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the effect of our capital structure and asset base from our operating results 
neither ebitda nor adjusted ebitda is a measure calculated in accordance with gaap 
the items excluded from ebitda and adjusted ebitda are significant in assessing our operating results 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda have limitations as analytical tools  and should not be considered in isolation from  or as a substitute for  analysis of our results as reported under gaap 
for example  ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect our cash expenditures  or future requirements for capital and major maintenance expenditures or contractual commitments  do not reflect income tax expenses or the cash requirements necessary to pay income taxes  do not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  and do not reflect the significant interest expense  or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments  on certain of our debt obligations 
in addition  although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future  and ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements 
other companies in our industry and in other industries may calculate ebitda and adjusted ebitda differently from the way that we do  limiting their usefulness as comparative measures 
because of these limitations  ebitda and adjusted ebitda should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business 
we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our gaap results and using ebitda and adjusted ebitda only as supplemental data 

table of contents the tables below show how we calculated adjusted ebitda and includes a breakdown by segment

table of contents significant anticipated variances between and and related uncertainties we expect a number of factors to result in differences in our results of operation  financial condition and liquidity in relative to we expect significantly higher overall levels of cash and liquidity throughout as a result of the issuance of the parent notes  as well as increased coal operating profits and decreased heritage health benefit expenditures  we expect to take a charge to our earnings in of approximately million as a result of the issuance of the parent notes and the mark to market accounting of the conversion feature in our convertible notes  we expect an increase in the repayments of long term debt resulting from our wml notes as well as from the various debt paid off with the proceeds of the parent notes  we expect significantly higher overall levels of debt and interest expense throughout as a result of the issuance of the parent notes  we expect to pay approximately million of preferred stock dividends in  we expect our overall coal tons delivered to decrease due to the december  expiration of a long term coal supply contract at our rosebud mine 
while this decrease will drive a decrease in overall tonnage sold  we expect the expiration of the contract to increase our profits and cash flow as our cost per ton sold was significantly greater than the fixed price per ton we were receiving under the contract  we expect our power operating profit to increase slightly due to the significant maintenance expenses incurred in relating to a planned maintenance shutdown 
in addition  the rova credit agreements required us to perform certain maintenance procedures that were not otherwise required 
as a result  we expect the termination of those agreements in connection with the completion of the parent notes offering will result in further reductions in maintenance expenses  we expect an increase in our depreciation  depletion  and amortization expense in due to increases in our asset reclamation obligation studies driving increased depletion expense as well as slightly increased capital spending levels in  we expect to make additional capital investments during in the range of to million to improve our mining operations  decrease our equipment maintenance costs  and increase our coal reserves 
we expect these capital investments to be funded through our mine s operating cash flows or  if necessary  wml s existing credit facility or capital leases  and we expect an increase in our investments in bond collateral in the range of to million primarily as a result of securing reclamation bonds for new mining areas in we believe the net effect of the foregoing factors will result in an increase in cash flows in relative to excluding the expected charge to our earnings in of approximately million explained above  we expect an overall increase in our results of operations due to increased coal operating profits 
our outlook for is based on the information we currently have available and contains certain assumptions regarding future economic conditions 
differences in actual economic conditions compared with our assumptions could have a material impact on our results in and in subsequent years 
key operational uncertainties relating to our expectations are described in risk factors and item coal segment material effects of regulation and power segment material effects of regulation 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources following the february  parent notes offering  we now have cash on hand in excess of million 
we also expect increases in coal operating profits and our heritage health benefit expenditures to continue at their reduced rates 
as a result  we anticipate that our cash flows from operations  cash on hand and available borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet our investing  financing  and working capital requirements for the next several years 
parent notes offering february  and use of proceeds on february   we issued million of senior secured notes due together with westmoreland partners as co issuer 
interest is due at an annual fixed rate of and will be paid in cash semi annually  in arrears  on february and august of each year beginning august  the parent notes mature february  they are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by westmoreland energy llc and wri and their respective subsidiaries other than absaloka coal  llc and by other subsidiaries 
as a result of the parent notes offering  we recorded the current portion of our convertible notes  current portions of wri s term and revolving line of credit and rova s term debt as non current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet at december  we received net proceeds from the sale of the parent notes in this offering of approximately million after deducting the initial purchaser s discount or million and offering costs of million 
we repaid existing outstanding debt as follows million to repay all outstanding term and revolving line of credit at rova  which includes a make whole payment of million  million to repay all outstanding term and revolving line of credit at wri  and million to retire certain of our convertible notes 
the holder of our convertible notes agreed to convert the convertible notes not retired into shares of our common stock 
in addition  we used million of the net proceeds to pay all dividend arrearages on our preferred stock 
we will use the remaining net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes including the possible acquisition of new reserves 
the indenture governing the parent notes requires us to offer to redeem these notes on an annual basis with certain excess cash flow as defined in the indenture  and amounts used for such redemptions will not be available for other purposes 
in connection with the parent notes offering  we terminated the wri and rova revolving credit agreements 
the wml credit agreements remained in place following the offering 
however  following the parent notes offering  we are still able to enter into a revolving credit facility without the consent of the holders of the notes  subject to certain conditions 
liquidity limitations and requirements the cash at wml is available to us through quarterly distributions 
the wml credit agreement requires a debt service account and imposes timing and other restrictions on the ability of wml to distribute funds to us 
cash available from wml is affected beginning in by payments due in respect of principal on the wml notes 
following the february  parent notes offering  we expect that distributions from rova and wri will comprise a significant source of liquidity for us 
the cash at wrm is also available to us through dividends  subject to maintaining a statutory minimum level of capital  which was million at december  our liquidity continues to be affected by our heritage health and pension as follows actual expected in millions postretirement medical benefits pension contributions cbf premiums workers compensation benefits of the pension contribution  million was made through the contribution of company stock 
no stock contributions are expected in 
table of contents wml has million of fixed rate term debt outstanding at december  principal on the notes is scheduled to be paid as follows million in  million in  million in  million in  million in  million in  million in and the remaining million in the revolving credit facility has a borrowing limit of million and matures in june the interest rate under the revolving credit facility at december  was per annum 
at december   wml had an outstanding balance of million under the revolving credit facility and a letter of credit of million supported by the revolving credit facility  leaving it with million of unused borrowings 
wml s revolving line of credit is only available to fund the operations of its respective subsidiaries 
wml s credit agreement contains various affirmative and negative covenants 
operational covenants in the agreements prohibit  among other things  wml from incurring or guaranteeing additional indebtedness  creating liens on its assets  making investments or engaging in asset sales or transactions with affiliates  in each case subject to specified exceptions 
financial covenants in the agreements impose requirements relating to specified debt service coverage and leverage ratios 
the debt service coverage ratio must meet or exceed a specified minimum 
the leverage ratio covenant requires that wml not permit the ratio of total debt at the end of each quarter to ebitda both as defined for the four quarters then ended to be greater than a specified amount 
wml met all of its covenant requirements as of december  and expects to meet all covenant requirements for the foreseeable future 
wml s term debt and revolving credit facility are secured by substantially all of the assets of wml and its subsidiaries other than texas westmoreland coal co  or twcc  our membership interests in wml  including certain dividends and other proceeds from such interests  and substantially all of the stock of wml s subsidiaries other than twcc 
historical sources and uses of cash the following is a summary of cash provided by or used in each of the indicated types of activities years ended december  in thousands cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities cash provided by operating activities increased million in compared to primarily as a result of a million reduction in net loss in the increase in operating cash flows was partially offset by the million decrease in cash receipts due to a contractually scheduled decrease in the payments rova collects from its customer 
cash used in investing activities decreased million in compared to primarily as a result of the reduction in our capital spending in additions to property  plant and equipment were million in compared to million in cash used in financing activities in remained consistent with our working capital deficit at december  decreased by million to approximately million compared to a million deficit at december  primarily as a result of a decrease in current installments of long term debt and also a decrease in other current liabilities due to the payment of a settlement for reclamation claims 

table of contents contractual obligations and commitments the following table presents information about our contractual obligations and commitments as of december   and the effects such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
some of the amounts below are estimates 
we discuss these obligations and commitments elsewhere in this filing 
payments due by period total after in thousands long term debt obligations principal and interest capital lease obligations principal and interest operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities totals proforma long term debt obligations principal and interest on february   we refinanced our convertible notes  wri s term and revolving line of credit and rova s term debt

represents benefit payments for our postretirement medical benefits  black lung  workers compensation  and combined benefit fund plans  as well as contributions for our defined benefit pension plans and final reclamation costs 
amounts shown are subsequent to the parent notes offering in february critical accounting policies postretirement medical benefits we have an obligation to provide postretirement medical benefits to our former employees and their dependents 
detailed information related to this liability is included in note to our consolidated financial statements 
our liability for our employees postretirement medical benefit costs is recorded on our consolidated balance sheets in amounts equal to the actuarially determined liability  as this obligation is not funded 
we use various assumptions including the discount rate and future cost trends  to estimate the cost and obligation for this item 
our discount rate for postretirement medical benefit is determined by utilizing a hypothetical bond portfolio model  which approximates the future cash flows necessary to service our liability 
this model is calculated using a yield curve that is developed using the average yield for bonds in the tenth to ninetieth percentiles  which excludes bonds with outlier yields 
we make assumptions related to future trends for medical care costs in the estimates of retiree health care obligations 
our medical trend assumption is developed by annually examining the historical trend of our cost per claim data and projecting forward the participant claims and our current benefit coverage 
these projections include the continuation of cost savings we achieved in from the modernization of how we provide prescription drug benefits to retirees 
if our assumptions do not materialize as expected  actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could differ materially from our current estimates 
moreover  regulatory changes could increase our obligation to satisfy these or additional obligations 
the ppaca could potentially impact these benefits 
the ppaca has both short term and long term implications on healthcare benefit plan standards 
implementation of this legislation is planned to occur in phases  with plan standard changes taking effect beginning in  but to a greater extend with the benefit plan year and extending through we will continue to evaluate the impact of the ppaca in future periods as additional information  interpretations and guidance becomes available 

table of contents below we have provided a sensitivity analysis to demonstrate the significance of the health care cost trend rate assumptions in relation to reported amounts 
postretirement medical benefits health care cost trend rate increase decrease in thousands effect on service and interest cost components effect on postretirement medical benefit obligation asset retirement obligations  final reclamation costs and reserve estimates our asset retirement obligations primarily consist of cost estimates for final reclamation of surface land and support facilities at both surface mines and power plants in accordance with federal and state reclamation laws 
asset retirement obligations are based on projected pit configurations at the end of mining and are determined for each mine using estimates and assumptions including estimates of disturbed acreage as determined from engineering data  estimates of future costs to reclaim the disturbed acreage  the timing of these cash flows  and a credit adjusted  risk free rate 
as changes in estimates occur such as mine plan revisions  changes in estimated costs  or changes in timing of the final reclamation activities  the obligation and asset are revised to reflect the new estimate after applying the appropriate credit adjusted  risk free rate to the changes 
if our assumptions do not materialize as expected  actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could be materially different from currently estimated 
moreover  regulatory changes could increase our obligation to perform final reclamation and mine closing activities 
certain of our customers have either agreed to reimburse us for final reclamation expenditures as they are incurred or have pre funded a portion of the expected reclamation costs 
see additional information regarding our asset retirement obligations in note to our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes and deferred income taxes as of december   we had significant deferred tax assets 
our deferred tax assets include federal and state regular net operating losses  or nols  alternative minimum tax  or amt  credit carryforwards  indian coal tax credits  or ictc  carryforwards  and net deductible reversing temporary differences related to on going differences between book and taxable income 
we believe we will be taxed under the amt system for the foreseeable future due to the significant amount of statutory tax depletion in excess of book depletion expected to be generated by our mining operations 
as a result  we have determined that a valuation allowance is required for all of our regular federal net operating loss carryforwards and amt credit carryforwards since they are only available to offset future regular taxes 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance for all but million of our state nols since we believe they will not be realized 
no valuation allowance is being provided on million of deferred tax assets because we believe that these nols will be used to offset our liabilities relating to our uncertain tax positions 
we have determined that a full valuation allowance is required for all of our ictc carryforward 
the ictc can generally be used to offset amt liability 
we do not believe we have sufficient positive evidence to substantiate that our deferred tax asset for the ictc carryforward is realizable at a more likely than not level of assurance 
as a result  we will continue to record a full valuation allowance on our ictc carryforward  reversing valuation allowance only if utilized in a future year 
we have determined that since our net deductible temporary differences will not reverse for the foreseeable future  and we are unable to forecast when we will have regular taxable income when they do reverse  a full valuation allowance is required for these deferred tax assets  other than the deferred tax asset relating to our uncertain tax positions 

table of contents the tax effect of pretax income or loss from continuing operations is generally determined by a computation that does not consider the tax effects of items that are not included in continuing operations 
the exception to that incremental approach is that all items for example  items recorded in other comprehensive income  extraordinary items  and discontinued operations be considered in determining the amount of tax benefit that results from a loss from continuing operations and that shall be allocated to continuing operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued authoritative guidance  which requires additional disclosures and clarifies certain existing disclosure requirements regarding fair value measurements 
this guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  we adopted this guidance effective january  however  none of the specific additional disclosures were applicable at december  on january   we adopted accounting guidance that clarifies how to determine whether certain instruments or features are indexed to an entity s own stock 
this guidance was effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we recorded a cumulative effect of change in accounting principles upon adoption of this guidance 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 
on january   we adopted accounting guidance that establishes accounting and reporting standards for noncontrolling interests in partially owned consolidated subsidiaries and the loss of control of subsidiaries 
this guidance requires noncontrolling interests minority interests to be reported as a separate component of equity

the price may be adjusted in accordance with changes in broad economic indicators such as the consumer price index  commodity specific indices such as the ppi light fuel oils index  and or changes in our actual costs

we manage these items through strategic sourcing contracts in normal quantities with our suppliers and may use derivatives from time to time 
at december   we had fuel supply contracts outstanding with a minimum purchase requirement of million gallons of diesel fuel per year 
these contracts qualify for the normal purchase normal sale exception under hedge accounting
