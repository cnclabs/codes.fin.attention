item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations when you read this section of this report  it is important that you also read the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
this section contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those we anticipate in these forward looking statements for many reasons  including the factors described below and in the section entitled risk factors 
we are a vertically integrated dermatology company that is developing and marketing levulan pdt and other products for common skin conditions 
our marketed products include levulan kerastick topical solution with pdt  the blu u brand light source  and clindareach 
we devote most of our resources to advancing the development and marketing of our levulan pdt technology platform 
in addition to our marketed products  our drug  levulan brand of aminolevulinic acid hcl  or ala  in combination with light  has been studied in a broad range of medical conditions 
when levulan is used and followed with exposure to light to treat a medical condition  it is known as levulan pdt 
the kerastick is our proprietary applicator that delivers levulan 
the blu u is our patented light device 
the levulan kerastick topical solution with pdt and the blu u were launched in the united states  or us  in september for the treatment of non hyperkeratotic actinic keratoses  or aks  of the face or scalp 
aks are precancerous skin lesions caused by chronic sun exposure that can develop over time into a form of skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma 
in addition  in september we received clearance from the united states food and drug administration  or fda  to market the blu u without levulan pdt for the treatment of moderate inflammatory acne vulgaris and general dermatological conditions 
sirius laboratories  inc  or sirius  a dermatology specialty pharmaceuticals company  was founded in with a primary focus on the treatment of acne vulgaris and acne rosacea 
nicomide was its key product  a vitamin mineral product prescribed by dermatologists 
we merged with sirius in march we are marketing levulan pdt under an exclusive worldwide license of patents  many of which have expired  and technology from parteq research and development innovations  the licensing arm of queen s university  kingston  ontario  canada 
we also own or license certain other patents relating to our blu u device and methods for using pharmaceutical formulations which contain our drug and related processes and improvements 
in the united states  dusa  dusa pharmaceuticals  inc  levulan  kerastick  blu u  nicomide  nicomide t  clindareach  meted  and psoriacap are registered trademarks 
several of these trademarks are also registered in europe  australia  canada  and in other parts of the world 
numerous other trademark applications are pending 
we are responsible for manufacturing our levulan kerastick and for the regulatory  sales  marketing  and customer service and other related activities for all of our products  including our levulan kerastick 
transactions the following significant transaction occurred during termination of marketing  distribution and supply agreement with stiefel laboratories on september   the company gave notice to stiefel laboratories  inc terminating the parties marketing  distribution and supply agreement  dated january   as amended  as of september  the termination of this agreement  which had appointed stiefel as our exclusive marketing and distribution partner for our product  the levulan kerastick  in latin america  resulted in the acceleration of the recognition of deferred revenues of  comprised of deferred drug shipments of  and the unamortized balance of milestone payments of  and the acceleration of deferred cost of revenues of  in  the stiefel termination resulted in the recognition of  of income from operations 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies are those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods and that can significantly affect our financial position and results of operations 
our accounting policies are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we have discussed these policies and the underlying estimates used in applying these accounting policies with our audit committee 
since not all of these accounting policies require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates  they are not all considered critical accounting policies 
we consider the following policies and estimates to be critical to our financial statements 
revenue recognition accounting for revenue transactions relies on certain estimates that require difficult  subjective and complex judgments on the part of management 
pdt revenue we recognize revenues on kerastick and blu u product sales in the us and canada when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and determinable  delivery has occurred  and collection is reasonably assured 
we offer programs that allow physicians and hospitals access to our blu u device for a trial period 
we do not recognize revenue on these units until the physician or hospital elects to purchase the equipment and all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
our terms with customers do not provide for the right of return for sales of kerastick and blu u  unless the product does not comply with the technical specifications 
for revenues associated with contractual agreements with multiple elements  we apply the revenue recognition criteria outlined in securities and exchange commission  or sec  staff accounting bulletin topic  revenue recognition  or sab topic  and accounting standard codification  or asc   multiple element arrangements 
we analyze each contract in order to separate each deliverable into separate units of accounting  if applicable  and then recognize revenue for those separated units as earned 
significant judgment is required in determining the units of accounting and the attribution method for such arrangements 
we have entered into exclusive marketing  distribution and supply agreements with distributors in latin america and asia pacific that contain multiple deliverables 
the deliverables are treated as a single unit of accounting 
we have determined the attribution method for each of the separate payment streams 
under the terms of these agreements  we receive non refundable milestone payments  a fixed price per unit sold and royalties based on a percentage of the net sales price to end users 
we defer and recognize milestone payments as license revenues on a straight line basis  beginning on the date the milestone is achieved through the term of the agreement 
we recognize the fixed price per unit sold once the price is fixed and determinable  which occurs when units are sold through to end users 
we record royalty revenue when earned  which is also upon sale to end users 
additionally  we do not have sufficient data to determine product acceptance in the marketplace 
the agreements require the distributors to make minimum purchases 
if minimum purchase obligations are not fulfilled  the distributors are required to pay the difference between their actual purchases and the contractual minimums a gross up payment 
we record revenue for the gross up payment upon cash receipt 
for daewoong  the company s distributor in asia pacific  the minimum purchase commitment is measured over a five year period  which has not yet ended 
non pdt revenue we recognize revenue for sales of non pdt drug products when substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer  which generally occurs on the date of shipment to wholesale customers 
revenue is recognized net of revenue reserves  which consist of allowances for discounts  returns  rebates  chargebacks and fees paid to wholesalers under distribution service agreements 
we evaluate inventory levels at our wholesaler customers through an analysis that considers  among other things  wholesaler purchases  wholesaler shipments to retailers  available end user prescription data obtained from third parties and on hand inventory data received directly from our three largest wholesaler customers 

table of contents we believe that this evaluation of wholesaler inventory levels  allows us to make reasonable estimates for our applicable revenue related reserves 
additionally  our products are sold to wholesalers with a product shelf life that allows sufficient time for our wholesaler customers to sell the products in their inventory through to retailers and  ultimately  to end user consumers prior to product expiration 
for new product launches where we do not have the ability to reliably estimate returns  revenue is recognized based on end user demand  which is typically based on dispensed subscription data  or ship through data as reported by our international distribution partners 
when inventories have been reduced to targeted stocking levels at wholesalers or distribution partners  and we have sufficient data to determine product acceptance in the marketplace which allows us to estimate product returns  we recognize revenue upon shipment  net of discounts and allowances 
we account for sales returns by establishing an accrual in an amount equal to our estimate of sales recorded for which the related products are expected to be returned 
we determine the estimate of the sales return accrual primarily based on historical experience regarding sales and related returns and incorporating other factors that could impact sales returns in the future 
these other factors include levels of inventory in the distribution channel  estimated shelf life  product recalls  product discontinuances  price changes of competitive products  introductions of generic products and introductions of competitive new products 
our policy is to accept returns when product is within six months of expiration 
we consider all of these factors and adjust the accrual periodically to reflect actual experience 
our reserve for sales returns has declined as revenues from non pdt drug products have declined 
chargebacks typically occur when suppliers enter into contractual pricing arrangements with end user customers  including certain federally mandated programs  who then purchase from wholesalers at prices below what the supplier charges the wholesaler 
since we only offer preferred pricing to end user customers under federally mandated programs  chargebacks have not been significant 
our rebate programs can generally be categorized into the following two types medicaid rebates and consumer rebates 
medicaid rebates are amounts owed based on legal requirements with public sector benefit providers after the final dispensing of the product by a pharmacy to a benefit plan participant 
consumer rebates are amounts owed as a result of mail in coupons that are distributed by health care providers to consumers at the time a prescription is written 
inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
cost is determined using the first in  first out method 
inventories are continually reviewed for slow moving  obsolete and excess items 
inventory items identified as slow moving are evaluated to determine if an adjustment is required 
additionally  our industry is characterized by regular technological developments that could result in obsolete inventory 
although we make every effort to assure the reasonableness of our estimates  any significant unanticipated changes in demand  technological development  or significant changes to our business model could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our results of operations 
we use sales projections to estimate the appropriate level of inventory reserves  if any  that are necessary at each balance sheet date 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate 
factors we consider important  which could trigger an impairment review include significant changes relative to i projected future operating results  ii the use of the assets or the strategy for the overall business  iii business collaborations  and iv industry  business  or economic trends and developments 
each impairment test is based on a comparison of the undiscounted cash flow to the recorded value of the asset 
if we determine that the carrying value of long lived or intangible assets may not be recoverable  we write down the assets to their estimated fair value on a discounted cash flow basis 
at december  and  respectively  total property  plant and equipment had a net carrying value of  and  including  at december  associated with our manufacturing facility 
in  we made a cash payment of million to former sirius shareholders as consideration for a cumulative sales milestone as provided in the merger agreement 
as this payment was deemed additional consideration related to the acquisition  we recorded goodwill in the amount of million and immediately recorded an impairment charge to the statement of operations for the same amount 
while we do not have any goodwill on the balance sheet at december   we may incur future goodwill impairment charges if we 
table of contents are required to make additional payments to former sirius shareholders 
the pre determined cumulative sales milestones for the sirius products and the related milestone payments which may be paid in cash or shares  as we may determine  are as follows additional cumulative sales milestone consideration million million million million total million in april  we entered into the third amendment to the merger agreement  or third amendment  as described in note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
as consideration for the third amendment and related documents  we paid the former sirius shareholders  on a pro rata basis and have guaranteed a payment of  in january if the  sales milestone is not triggered 
financial instruments financial instruments recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets include cash equivalents  marketable securities and the common stock purchase warrant liability 
fair value is based on the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
we follow the fair value disclosure hierarchy that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value into three broad levels  which are described below level quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level primarily consists of financial instruments whose value is based on quoted market prices such as exchange traded instruments and listed equities 
level observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data 
level includes financial instruments that are valued using models or other valuation methodologies 
level unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data 
level is comprised of financial instruments whose fair value is estimated based on internally developed models or methodologies utilizing significant inputs that are generally less readily observable 
our cash equivalents are level instruments 
the fair value is based on transacted prices in an active market 
in determining the fair value of our marketable securities  we consider the level of market activity and the availability of prices for the specific securities that we hold 
for our level financial instruments  comprising our corporate debt and united states government backed securities  we use quoted market prices  broker or dealer quotations  or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency in the determination of value 
we also access publicly available market activity from third party databases and credit ratings of the issuers of the securities we hold to corroborate the data used in the fair value calculations obtained from our primary source 
we take into account credit rating changes  if any  of the securities or recent marketplace activity 
we do not have any level marketable securities 
the warrant liability is carried at fair value and fair value is measured using level inputs 
we initially recorded the warrant liability at its fair value using the black scholes option pricing model and revalue it at each reporting date until the warrants are exercised or expire 
changes in the fair value of the warrants are reported in our statements of operations as non operating income or expense under the caption loss gain on change in fair value of warrants 
the fair value of the warrants is subject to significant fluctuation based on changes in our stock price  expected volatility  remaining contractual life and the risk free interest rate 
the market price for our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile 
consequently  future fluctuations in the price of our common stock may cause significant increases or decreases in the fair value of the warrants 

table of contents results of operations year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  revenues total revenues for were  as compared to  in and were comprised of the following year ended december  increase decrease pdt drug and device product revenues levulan kerastick product revenues united states canada korea rest of world subtotal levulan kerastick product revenues blu u product revenues united states canada subtotal blu u product revenues total pdt drug and device product revenues total non pdt drug product revenues total product revenues for the year ended december   total pdt drug and device products revenues  comprised of revenues from our kerastick and blu u products  were  this represents an increase of  or  over the comparable total of  the incremental revenue was driven primarily by increased kerastick revenues in the united states 
for the year ended december   kerastick revenues were  representing an increase of  or  over the comparable totals of  kerastick unit sales to end users for the year ended december  were  including  sold in canada and  sold in korea 
this represents an increase from  kerastick units sold in the year ended december   including  sold in canada and  sold in korea 
our average net selling price for the kerastick increased to for the year ended december  from in our average net selling price for the kerastick includes sales made directly to our end user customers  as well as sales made to our distributors  in canada  korea and the rest of the world 
the increase in kerastick revenues were driven mainly by increased sales volumes in the united states along with an increase in our overall average unit selling price  and the acceleration of the recognition of deferred revenues of  related to the termination of our latin american distribution agreement with stiefel 
for the year ended december   blu u revenues were  a decrease of  or  from blu u revenues of  the slight decrease in blu u revenues were the result of a decrease in our average selling price  partially offset by increased sales volumes 
in the year ended december   there were units sold  as compared to units in the total consists of sold in the united states and sold in canada 
the total consists of units sold in the united states and sold in canada 
our average net selling price for the blu u decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the decrease in our average selling price in compared with reflects lower pricing that we offered to customers in advance of the introduction of an upgraded blu u design  which became available in april our blu u evaluation program allows customers to take delivery for a limited number of blu u units for a period of up to months for private 
table of contents practitioners and up to year for hospital clinics  before we require a purchase decision 
at december   there were approximately units in the field pursuant to this evaluation program  compared to units in the field at december  the units are classified as inventory in the financial statements and are being amortized during the evaluation period to cost of goods sold using an estimated life for the equipment of three years 
we have to continue to demonstrate the clinical value of our unique therapy  and the related product benefits as compared to other well established conventional therapies  in order for the medical community to accept our products on a large scale 
we are aware that physicians are using levulan with the blu u using short incubation times  and with light devices manufactured by other companies  and for uses other than our fda approved use 
while we are not permitted to market our products for so called off label uses  we believe that these activities are positively affecting the sales of our products 
additionally in  we plan to initiate a clinical trial to study short incubation methods which  if successful  will allow us to enhance our product label and market our therapy under a treatment method being adopted by the medical community 
non pdt drug product revenues reflect the revenues generated by the products acquired as part of our acquisition of sirius 
total non pdt drug product revenues for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the year ended december  in  the substantial majority of the non pdt product revenues were from sales of clindareach and royalties received from river s edge from sales of the avar product line 
royalties from our license of the avar product line with river s edge ceased during the fourth quarter of in  the substantial majority of non pdt product revenues were from nicomide related royalties  which included a  installment payment received from river s edge under the nicomide license amendment 
in the fourth quarter of  the uspto issued an ex parte reexamination certificate on the nicomide patent  which confirmed the patentability of narrowed claims  which we believe strengthens those claims 
in light of the issuance of the ex parte reexamination certificate by the uspto  we are evaluating our options relative to the nicomide asset 
we do not expect to derive significant revenues or cash flows  if at all  from this asset given fda s opinion of its regulatory status as a marketed unapproved drug 
also  other new products have been launched that are competing with nicomide 
the increase in our total product revenues for compared with results primarily from increased kerastick revenues in the united states  partially offset by decreases in kerastick revenues in our international locations  blu u revenues and non pdt revenues 
during  our pdt segment revenues in the united states grew as a result of increased demand for our product  as well as our pricing strategies 
with respect to kerastick prices  we announced a price increase in the fourth quarter of and intend to announce a price increase on an annual basis in the fourth quarter each year 
this strategy is likely to have a positive influence on sales in the fourth quarter of each year 
our ability to be profitable each quarter may also be affected by fluctuations in the demand for our products caused by both seasonal changes  such as when patients visits slow during summer months  and the timing of pricing changes which may impact purchasing patterns of our customers 
although we expect continued growth in our pdt segment revenues  we are susceptible to the uncertain economic conditions  particularly with our customer base in the us and internationally where our product lacks reimbursement  and to increased competition particularly from metvixia 
photocure received fda approval to market metvixia for treatment of aks in july  and this product is directly competitive with our levulan kerastick product 
on october   photocure announced that it had sold metvix metvixia to galderma  sa  a large dermatology company 
while we are entitled to royalties on net sales of metvixia  galderma has considerably more resources than we have  which could significantly hamper our ability to maintain or increase our market share 
metvixia is commercially available in the us  however  product revenues have not been significant to date 
also  leo pharma  a danish corporation that acquired peplin in  has announced that in it will be launching pep for the treatment of aks  which could impact our market share 
also  softness in the international markets could be expected until the economy recovers 
in addition  we expect our non pdt product revenues for to be reduced from levels since the avar royalty period ended during the fourth quarter of also see the section entitled risk factors we may not continue to be profitable each quarter unless we can successfully market and sell significantly higher quantities of our products

the stiefel termination resulted in the recognition of  of gross margin 
our long term goal is to achieve higher gross margins on 
table of contents kerastick sales which will be significantly dependent on increased volume 
we believe that we could achieve improved gross margins on our kerastick from further volume growth and price increases in the us blu u margins for the year ended december  were  as compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in gross margin is a result of a decrease in our average selling price 
it is important for us to sell blu u units in an effort to drive kerastick sales volumes and accordingly  we may sell blu u units at low profit margins 
non pdt gross margins reflect the gross margin generated by the products acquired as part of our merger with sirius 
total non pdt gross margin for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  non pdt cost of goods sold for includes a charge of  net of insurance recoveries of  related to a shipment of clindareach that was lost while in transit to us 
research and development costs research and development costs for were  as compared to  in the increase in compared to was due primarily to increased spending on development projects and investigator studies 
in the third quarter of  we announced that we would be closing out our solid organ transplant recipient  or sotr  clinical trial program in response to the fda s denial of our application for orphan drug designation for the use of levulan pdt for the prevention of squamous cell carcinomas  or scc  in patients who have a proven history of multiple localized cutaneous sccs  such as sotrs 
we are planning to initiate a dusa sponsored clinical trial to support the addition to our label of a broad area application  short drug incubation  or basdi  method of using the levulan kerastick 
the purpose of the planned phase clinical trial will be to investigate the optimal incubation time that levulan remains on the skin prior to use of our blu u  which  if successful  could then be used in a subsequent phase study 
the study objectives would be to determine and compare the safety and efficacy of the basdi method of using levulan pdt as compared to vehicle pdt  and to evaluate the effect of incubation times  or hours on the treatment of multiple actinic keratoses and photodamage of the face or scalp 
we are finalizing a clinical protocol and are targeting the second quarter of for initiation of the study 
we expect research and development spending to increase in by approximately  as compared to  as a consequence of this development program 
we expect that research and development costs related to the basdi clinical program will range from  to  during the next three years  assuming we proceed with phase trials 
marketing and sales costs marketing and sales costs for the year ended december  were  as compared to  for the year ended december  these costs consisted primarily of expenses such as salaries and benefits for the marketing and sales staff  commissions  and related support expenses such as travel  and telephone  totaling  in  compared to  in the increase in spending in in this category is due primarily to higher commissions expense in the remaining expenses consisted of tradeshows  miscellaneous marketing and outside consultants totaling  in  compared to  in the decrease in this category is due primarily to a decrease in tradeshow and other promotional spending in we expect marketing and sales costs for to increase compared to levels  but to decrease as a percentage of revenues due  in part  to the additional sales representatives we hired in early  which will account for approximately  of the increase 
general and administrative costs general and administrative costs for the year ended december  were  as compared to  for the year ended december  the increase is mainly attributable to an increase in compensation related expense  which partially resulted from a non cash charge related to a modification of stock options for former members of the board of directors 
general and administrative expenses are highly dependent on our legal and other professional fees  which can vary significantly from period to period 
we expect general and administrative costs to increase in compared with  but to decrease as a percentage of revenues 
loss gain on change in fair value of warrants the warrants issued to investors in connection with the october  private placement were recorded initially at fair value and are marked to market each reporting period 
the increase in the liability during and was  and  respectively  
table of contents which resulted in non cash losses in the respective periods 
the increases or decreases in fair value of the warrants are primarily due to changes in our stock price and the length of time remaining prior to expiration 
other income  net other income for the year ended december  decreased to  as compared to  in this decrease reflects a general decrease in interest rates over that timeframe 
income taxes there is no provision for income taxes due to the full valuation allowance 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards remaining of approximately  and tax credit carryforwards of approximately  for federal tax purposes 
these amounts expire at various times through we have provided a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets at december  and based on an internal revenue code irc section study performed  we determined that we have experienced prior ownership changes  as defined under irc section  with the most recent change in ownership occurring in the ownership change 
our pre change nol carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation of approximately million per year 
further  additional rules provide for the enhancement of the aforementioned annual limitation for the first five years after the ownership change 
a loss corporation may increase its irc section limitation by the amount of the net unrealized built in gain  or nubig  recognized within five years of the ownership change 
our calculated aggregate amount of nubig enhancement is approximately million ie  approximately  per year for the first five years after the ownership change 
this nubig enhancement will be utilized in conjunction with the approximately million of irc section base annual limitation  resulting in approximately million per year for the first five years after the ownership change 
based on these additional factors  we estimate that we will be able to utilize approximately million of our current net operating losses  provided that sufficient income is generated and no further ownership changes were to occur 
however  it is reasonably possible that a future ownership change  which could be the result of transactions involving our common stock that are outside of our control such as sales by existing shareholders  could occur during or thereafter 
future ownership changes could further restrict our utilization of our net operating losses and tax credits  reducing or eliminating the benefit of such net operating losses and tax credits 
an ownership change occurs under irc section if the aggregate stock ownership of certain shareholders increases by more than percentage points over such shareholders lowest percentage ownership during the testing period  which is generally three years 
net income loss for  we reported net income of  or per share  as compared to a net loss of  or per share  for the increase in our net income  or decrease in our net loss  is attributable to the reasons discussed above

recently issued accounting guidance in october  the fasb issued accounting standards update  or asu  no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements asu no 

asu no 
 which amends existing revenue recognition accounting pronouncements and provides accounting principles and application guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the arrangement should be separated  and the consideration allocated 
this guidance eliminates the requirement to establish the fair value of undelivered products and services and instead provides for separate revenue recognition based upon management s estimate of the selling price for an undelivered item when there is no other means to determine the fair value of that undelivered item 
previous accounting principles required that the fair value of the undelivered item be the price of the item either sold in a separate transaction between unrelated third parties or the price charged for each item when the item is sold separately by the vendor 
this was difficult to determine when the product was not individually sold because of its unique features 
if the fair value of all of the elements in the arrangement was not determinable  then revenue was deferred until all of the items were delivered or fair value was determined 
this new approach is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june   which for us means january  the adoption of asu did not have a material impact 
in december  the fasb issued asu no 
 fees paid to the federal government by pharmaceutical manufacturers asu 
asu provides guidance concerning the recognition and classification of the new annual fee payable by branded prescription drug manufacturers and importers on branded prescription drugs  which was mandated under the health care reform legislation enacted in the us in march under this new accounting standard  the annual fee  which we do not expect to be material to our operating results  would be presented as a component of operating expenses and recognized over the calendar year such fees are payable using a straight line method of allocation unless another method better allocates the fee over the calendar year 
this asu is effective for calendar years beginning on or after december   when the fee initially becomes effective  which for us is as this standard relates only to classification  the adoption of this accounting standard will not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure to any non us government single issue  issuer or type of investment 
our investments consist of us government securities and high grade corporate bonds 
all investments are carried at fair value 
as of december   the weighted average yield to maturity on our investments was 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by basis points from levels as of december   the fair market value of the portfolio would decline by  declines in interest rates could  over time  reduce our interest income 
derivative financial instruments the warrants that we issued on october  in connection with the private placement of our common stock were determined to be derivative financial instruments and accounted for as a liability 
we revalue these warrants on a quarterly basis with any change in value reflected in our earnings 
we value these warrants using various assumptions  including our common stock price as of the end of each reporting period  the historical volatility of our common stock price  and risk free interest rates commensurate with the remaining contractual term of the warrants 
changes in our common stock price or in interest rates would result in a change in the value of the warrants and impact our consolidated statement of operations 
a increase in our common stock price would cause the fair value of the warrants and our warrant liability to increase by approximately  currency exchange rates under our agreement with daewoong  revenues we earn under the excess purchase price provision of the agreement  if any  are calculated based on end user pricing in local currencies and converted to us dollars before a determination is made whether any payments are due to us
