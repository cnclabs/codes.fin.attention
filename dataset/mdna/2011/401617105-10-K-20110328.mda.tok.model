item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general unless the context indicates otherwise  when we refer to we  us or the company in this form k  we are referring to guess  inc and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis 
business segments in fiscal  the company revised its segment reporting whereby the north american wholesale and asia segments are now separate segments for reporting purposes 
the company businesses are now grouped into five reportable segments for management and internal financial reporting purposes north american retail  europe  asia  north american wholesale and licensing 
information relating to these segments is summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements 
management evaluates segment performance based primarily on revenues and earnings from operations 
the company believes this segment reporting better reflects how its five business segments are managed and each segment performance is evaluated 
the north american retail segment includes the company retail operations in north america 
the europe segment includes the company wholesale and retail operations in europe and the middle east 
the asia segment includes the company wholesale and retail operations in asia 
the north american wholesale segment includes the company wholesale operations in north america 
the licensing segment includes the worldwide licensing operations of the company 
the business segment operating results exclude corporate overhead costs which consist of shared costs of the organization 
these costs are presented separately and generally include  among other things  the following unallocated corporate costs information technology  human resources  global advertising and marketing  accounting and finance  executive compensation  facilities and legal 
we acquired focus europe srl focus  our former licensee for guess by marciano products in europe  the middle east and asia  in december we also acquired barn srl barn  our former kids licensee in europe  in january each of these entities is reported in our europe segment 
g by guess is a relatively new retail brand concept that was launched in early fiscal and is included in our north american retail segment 
our south korea and china businesses  which we have operated directly since january and april  respectively  are reported in our asia segment 
our international jewelry license agreement  which expired in december  was not renewed as the company decided to directly operate this business going forward 
beginning in january  the operating results of our international jewelry business are included in our europe segment 
prior to that date  we recorded the related royalty income in our licensing segment 
products we derive our net revenue from the sale of guess  guess by marciano  guess kids and g by guess men and women apparel  and our licensees products through our worldwide network of retail stores  wholesale customers and distributors  as well as our on line sites 
we also derive royalty revenues from worldwide licensing activities 
recent global economic developments economic conditions remain uncertain in many markets around the world and consumer behavior remains cautious 
in north america in particular  the relatively weaker levels of consumer confidence and the highly promotional conditions among retailers may persist for some time 
these conditions could affect both our growth and our profitability 
the company anticipates that potential inflationary pressures on raw materials  labor  freight or other commodities including oil  could begin to negatively impact the cost of product purchases primarily in the second half of the fiscal year the company has plans to mitigate some of these effects through price 
table of contents increases on select items  supply chain initiatives  reduced markdowns and mix 
however  there can be no assurances that these actions will be successful 
in addition  increased prices could lead to reduced customer demand 
we also continue to experience significant volatility in the global currency markets 
since the majority of our international operations are conducted in currencies other than the us dollar primarily the euro  canadian dollar and korean won  currency fluctuations can have a significant impact on the translation of our international revenues and earnings into us dollar amounts 
during fiscal  the average us dollar rate was stronger against the euro while weaker against the canadian dollar and korean won versus the comparable prior year periods 
this had an overall negative impact on the translation of our international revenues and earnings for the year ended january  in addition  some of our transactions that occur in europe  canada and south korea are denominated in us dollars  swiss francs and british pounds exposing them to exchange rate fluctuations when converted to their functional currencies 
these transactions include us dollar denominated purchases of merchandise  us dollar and british pound intercompany liabilities and certain sales  operating expenses  and tax liabilities denominated in swiss francs 
fluctuations in exchange rates can impact the profitability of our foreign operations and reported earnings and are largely dependent on the transaction timing and magnitude during the period that the currency fluctuates 
the company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exchange risk on certain foreign currency transactions 
however  the company does not hedge all transactions denominated in foreign currency 
long term growth strategy despite the economic conditions described above  our key long term strategies remain unchanged 
global expansion continues to be the cornerstone of our growth strategy 
our combined revenues outside of the us and canada represented roughly half of the total company revenues in fiscal  compared to one fifth in fiscal we expect to continue to expand in both europe and asia 
expanding our retail business across the globe is another important part of our growth strategy 
we see opportunities to increase the number of guess branded retail stores in europe and asia 
in north america  we also see opportunities  particularly with our newer store concepts 
we will continue to regularly evaluate and implement initiatives that we believe will build brand equity  grow our business and enhance profitability 
our north american retail growth strategy is to increase retail sales and profitability by expanding our network of retail stores and improving the productivity and performance of existing stores 
we will continue to emphasize our new g by guess store concept and our accessories business 
this includes greater focus on our accessories line in our existing stores and the expansion of our guess accessories store concept 
we currently plan to open between and retail stores across all concepts in the us and canada during fiscal in addition  we plan to reinvest in key existing locations as part of the roll out of our new store designs 
in february  we opened our largest flagship store in the world in new york city with over  square feet 
in europe  we will continue to focus on developing new markets in northern europe where our brand is well known but under penetrated and expand on our recent success in western and southern europe 
the company is planning to increase the number of directly operated guess retail stores in europe 
we recently opened flagship stores in knightsbridge  london and paseo di gracia  barcelona and we have expanded our existing flagship store in milan  italy 
together with our licensee partners  we plan to continue our international expansion in europe by opening between and retail stores in fiscal  about a quarter of which will be owned and operated directly by us 
we see significant market opportunities in asia and we are dedicating capital and human resources to support the region growth and development 
we and our partners have opened flagship stores in key cities such as seoul  shanghai  hong kong  macau  taipei and beijing and have partnered with licensees to 
table of contents develop our business in the second tier cities in this region 
we and our partners plan to open retail stores across all concepts in asia during fiscal the company capital expenditures for the full fiscal year are planned at approximately million before deducting estimated lease incentives of approximately million  which includes key money investments for new european stores 
the planned capital expenditures are primarily for expansion of our retail businesses in europe and north america  store remodeling programs  expansion of our asia business  investments in information systems  and other infrastructure investments 
other the company reports national retail federation nrf calendar comparable store sales on a quarterly basis for our full price retail and factory outlet stores in the us and canada 
a store is considered comparable after it has been open for full months 
if a store remodel results in a square footage change of more than  or involves a relocation or a change in store concept  the store is removed from the comparable store base until it has been opened at its new size  in its new location or under its new concept for full months

critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases its estimates and judgments on its historical experience and other relevant factors  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
management evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis including those related to the valuation of inventories  accounts receivable allowances  sales return allowances  loyalty and gift card accruals  the useful life of assets for 
table of contents depreciation  restructuring expense and accruals  evaluation of asset impairment  recoverability of deferred taxes  unrecognized tax benefits  workers compensation accruals  litigation reserves  pension obligations and share based compensation 
the company believes that the following significant accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
in addition to the accounting policies mentioned below  see note to the consolidated financial statements for other significant accounting policies 
accounts receivable reserves in the normal course of business  the company grants credit directly to certain wholesale customers after a credit analysis is performed based on financial and other criteria 
accounts receivable are recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that result from the inability of its wholesale customers to make their required payments 
the company bases its allowances on analysis of the aging of accounts receivable at the date of the financial statements  assessments of historical collection trends  an evaluation of the impact of current economic conditions and whether the company has obtained credit insurance or other guarantees 
costs associated with customer markdowns are recorded as a reduction to revenues  and any unapplied amounts are included in the allowance for accounts receivable 
historically  these markdown allowances resulted from seasonal negotiations with the company wholesale customers  as well as historical trends and the evaluation of the impact of economic conditions 
sales returns reserves the company accrues for estimated sales returns in the period in which the related revenue is recognized 
to recognize the financial impact of sales returns  the company estimates the amount of goods that will be returned based on historical experience and reduces sales and cost of sales accordingly based on historical return experience 
the company policy allows retail customers in certain regions a day period to return merchandise following the date of sale 
substantially all of these returns are considered to be resalable at a price that exceeds the cost of the merchandise 
inventory reserves inventories are valued at the lower of cost primarily weighted average method or market 
the company continually evaluates its inventories by assessing slow moving product as well as prior seasons inventory 
market value of aged inventory is estimated based on historical sales trends for each product line category  the impact of market trends  an evaluation of economic conditions  available liquidation channels and the value of current orders relating to the future sales of this type of inventory 
the company closely monitors off price sales to ensure the actual results closely match initial estimates 
estimates are regularly updated based upon this continuing review 
valuation of goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets the company assesses the impairment of its long lived assets ie  goodwill  intangible assets and property and equipment  which requires the company to make assumptions and judgments regarding the carrying value of these assets on an annual basis  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
an asset is considered to be impaired if the company determines that the carrying value may not be recoverable based upon its assessment of the asset ability to continue to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods or if significant changes in the company strategic business objectives and utilization of the assets occurred 
if the assets other than goodwill are assessed to be recoverable  they are depreciated or amortized over the periods benefited 
if the assets are considered to be impaired  an impairment charge is recognized representing the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of those assets 
fair value is 
table of contents determined based upon the discounted cash flows derived from the underlying asset 
we use various assumptions in determining current fair market value of these assets  including future expected cash flows and discount rates 
future expected cash flows for store assets are based on management estimates of future cash flows over the remaining lease period or expected life  if shorter 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values  we may be exposed to future impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
pension benefit plan actuarial assumptions the company pension obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts  within the authoritative guidance framework 
the discount rate and estimated future compensation are both important elements of expense and or liability measurement 
we evaluate these critical assumptions annually which enables us to state expected future payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for supplemental executive retirement plan related information 
litigation reserves estimated amounts for claims that are probable and can be reasonably estimated are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
the likelihood of a material change in these estimated reserves would be dependent on new claims as they may arise and the expected favorable or unfavorable outcome of each claim 
as additional information becomes available  the company assesses the potential liability related to new claims and existing claims and revises estimates as appropriate 
as new claims arise or existing claims evolve  such revisions in estimates of the potential liability could materially impact the results of operations and financial position 
share based compensation effective january   the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of authoritative guidance using the modified prospective transition method 
under this method  compensation cost recognized after january  includes a compensation expense for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of december   based on the grant date fair value and b compensation expense for all share based payments granted on or after january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with authoritative guidance 
the fair value of each stock option is estimated on the grant date using the black scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions used for new grants 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect for the expected term of the option at the time of grant 
the expected volatility is determined based on an average of both historical volatility and implied volatility 
implied volatility is derived from exchange traded options on the company common stock 
the expected life used prior to november was based on the simplified method described in authoritative guidance 
for options granted beginning november  the expected term is determined based on historical trends 
the dividend yield for and prior years was assumed to be zero since the company had not historically declared and did not have a plan to declare dividends on an ongoing basis until the board of directors authorized and approved the initiation of quarterly dividends in february the expected dividend yield starting from is based on the company history and expectations of dividend payouts 
the expected forfeiture rate is determined based on historical data 
compensation expense for nonvested stock options and stock awards is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
in addition  the company grants certain nonvested stock awards and stock options that require the recipient to achieve certain minimum performance targets in order for these awards to vest 
if the minimum performance targets have not been achieved or are not expected to be achieved  no expense is recorded during the period 

table of contents income taxes the company adopted authoritative guidance in january  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
for those benefits to be recognized  a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities 
guidance was also provided on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the company financial position and results of operations 
the company continuing practice is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting bases and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled 
deferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances if we believe it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire asset will not be realized 
as all earnings from the company foreign operations are permanently reinvested and not distributed  the company income tax provision does not include additional us taxes on foreign operations 
hedge accounting the company operates in foreign countries  which exposes it to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the company has entered into certain forward contracts to hedge the risk of foreign currency rate fluctuations 
the company has elected to apply the hedge accounting rules in accordance with authoritative guidance for certain of these hedges 
the company objective is to hedge the variability in forecasted cash flows due to the foreign currency risk 
various transactions that occur in canada  europe and south korea are denominated in us dollars  british pounds or swiss francs and thus are exposed to earnings risk as a result of exchange rate fluctuations when converted to their functional currencies 
these types of transactions include us dollar denominated purchases of merchandise and us dollar and british pound intercompany liabilities 
in addition  certain sales  operating expenses  and tax liabilities are denominated in swiss francs and are exposed to earnings risk as a result of exchange rate fluctuations when converted to the functional currency 
the company enters into derivative financial instruments  including forward exchange contracts to manage exchange risk on certain of these anticipated foreign currency transactions 
changes in the fair value of forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders equity  and are recognized in cost of product sales  sg a or other income and expenses in the period which approximates the time the hedged merchandise inventory is sold or the hedged operating expense and hedged intercompany liability is incurred 
the company also has foreign currency contracts that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes 
changes in fair value of foreign currency contracts not qualifying as cash flow hedges are reported in net earnings as part of other income and expenses 
gift card breakage gift card breakage is income recognized due to the non redemption of a portion of gift cards sold by the company for which a liability was recorded in prior periods 
estimated breakage amounts are accounted for under the redemption recognition method and are classified as additional net revenues as the gift cards are redeemed 
the company determined a gift card breakage rate based upon historical redemption patterns  which represented the cumulative estimated amount of gift card breakage from the inception of the electronic gift card program in late any future revisions to the estimated breakage rate may result in changes in the amount of breakage income recognized in future periods 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the recognition of gift card breakage 

table of contents loyalty programs the company launched customer loyalty programs for its g by guess  guess and guess by marciano stores in july  august and september  respectively 
the guess and guess by marciano loyalty programs were merged in may under the programs  customers accumulate points based on purchase activity 
once a loyalty program member achieves a certain point level  the member earns awards that may only be redeemed for merchandise 
the programs have expiration dates for the points and awards 
prior to fiscal  all unexpired  unredeemed points and awards were accrued in current liabilities and recorded as a reduction of net sales as points were accumulated by the member 
in fiscal  the company revised its approach to estimate the value of future award redemptions under the existing loyalty program by incorporating historical redemption rates 
in connection with this revision  the company recorded a cumulative adjustment of million to increase net revenue and to adjust the current liability balance to an amount reflecting estimated future award redemptions 
this adjustment had a favorable impact of per share

sensitivity analysis at january   a sensitivity analysis of changes in the foreign currencies when measured against the us dollar indicates that  if the us dollar had uniformly weakened by against all of the us dollar denominated foreign exchange derivatives totaling us million  the fair value of the instruments would have decreased by us million 
conversely  if the us dollar uniformly strengthened by against all of the us dollar denominated foreign exchange derivatives  the fair value of these instruments would have increased by us million 
any resulting changes in the fair value of the hedged instruments may be more than or partially offset by changes in the fair value of certain balance sheet positions primarily us dollar denominated liabilities in our foreign operations impacted by the change in the foreign currency rate 
the ability to reduce the exposure of currencies on earnings depends on the magnitude of the derivatives compared to the balance sheet positions during each reporting cycle

the change in the unrealized fair value of the interest swap increased other income  net by million during fiscal year substantially all of the company remaining indebtedness is at variable rates of interest 
accordingly  changes in interest rates would impact the company results of operations in future periods 
a basis point increase in interest rates would have increased interest expense for the year ended january  by approximately million 
this increase would be partially offset by a favorable gain on the interest rate swap 
the fair value of the company debt instruments are based on the amount of future cash flows associated with each instrument discounted using the company incremental borrowing rate 
at january   the carrying value of all financial instruments was not materially different from fair value  as the interest rate on the company debt approximates rates currently available to the company
