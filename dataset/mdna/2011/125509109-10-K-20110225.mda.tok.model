back to contents overview of results summarized below are the key highlights for for additional information  see the remaining sections of this md a  which discuss both consolidated and segment results in more detail 
key consolidated financial data dollars in millions revenues medical membership in thousands adjusted income from operations shareholders income from continuing operations cash flows from operating activities shareholders equity includes medical members of the company s health care segment as well as the international health care business  including expatriate benefits 
for a definition of adjusted income from operations  see the consolidated results of operations section of this md a beginning on page results of operations revenues rose significantly in  reflecting strong premium growth in the company s ongoing operating segments due to solid growth in each of the company s targeted markets 
net investment income and realized investment results also improved significantly primarily reflecting improving economic conditions 
medical membership increased  reflecting the acquisition of vanbreda international as well as the strength of the company s value proposition centered around health advocacy and its focus on growth in targeted markets  primarily the middle market and select segments 
adjusted income from operations increased significantly in  reflecting focused execution of the company s business strategy  which includes a growing global customer base 
shareholders income from continuing operations also increased  but at a lower rate than adjusted income from operations 
this is primarily due to significantly lower results in the company s run off gmib business 
results from this business are volatile  as key market inputs to the valuation of these assets and liabilities  such as interest rates  are adjusted each quarter 
cash flows from operating activities remain strong  reflecting solid underlying earnings as well as business growth 
strong operating cash flows enabled the company to contribute million to its pension plan as well as to repurchase million shares of stock for million 
liquidity and financial condition during  the company entered into several transactions to position itself to execute on its strategy as well as to strengthen its liquidity and financial condition 
the recent acquisition of vanbreda international in the third quarter of positions the company to be a global leader in the delivery of expatriate benefits 
the company sold its workers compensation and case management business to genex holdings 
the company reduced its balance sheet exposure in the run off reinsurance operations by reinsuring its run off workers compensation and personal accident business 
the company retired portions of its long term debt through a tender offer process  and issued replacement debt at a significantly lower interest rate 
shareholders equity increased substantially during  reflecting strong shareholders net income as well as increased invested asset values primarily fixed maturities reflecting lower market yields 
those favorable impacts were partially offset by the unfavorable effects of the pension plan liability on shareholders equity due to changes in the discount rate and mortality assumptions 
the company s commercial mortgage loan portfolio continued to perform well  with minimal write downs and stabilizing real estate valuations

back to contents business strategy as a global health service organization  cigna s mission is to help the people it serves improve their health  well being and sense of security 
as part of this mission  the company remains committed to health advocacy as a means of creating sustainable solutions for employers  improving the health of the individuals that the company serves  and lowering the costs of health care for all constituencies 
cigna s long term growth strategy is based on growth in targeted geographies  product lines  buying segments and distribution channels  improving its strategic and financial flexibility  and pursuing additional opportunities in high growth markets with particular focus on individuals 
our strategy can be summarized as follows go deep with growth in targeted customer segments  geographies  buying segments and distribution channels  go individual by delivering high quality products and services which improve health  wellness and insurance needs that are helpful and easy to use  and go global by pursuing additional opportunities in high growth markets across the globe and serving individuals regardless of where they live and work 
to achieve these goals  cigna expects to focus on the following which have the most potential for profitable growth domestic health care segment 
in this market  cigna is focused on expanding and deepening client and customer relationships across each segment 
specifically within key geographic segments  growing the select market  which generally includes employers with more than but fewer than employees and the middle market segment which generally includes employers with more than but less than  employees  by leveraging the company s customer knowledge  differentiated service model  product portfolio and distribution model  engaging those national account employers who share and will benefit from the company s value proposition of using health advocacy and employee engagement to increase productivity  performance and the health outcomes of their employees  and targeting sub markets including industry  government and municipal entities and individuals that align closest to the company s stated strategy 
in the disability and life segment  cigna s strategy is to grow its disability business by fully leveraging the key components of its industry leading disability management model to reduce costs for its clients and return their employees to work sooner through effective customer engagement and early outreach  a full suite of clinical and return to work resources to support the employer s ability to manage disability and work related events  and specialized case management services that address an individual s unique needs 
in the international segment  cigna continues to expand the product and geographic footprint by executing local strategies that grow supplemental  primary medical and expatriate benefits through product and channel expansion in its supplemental health  life and accident business in key asian geographies  the introduction of new expatriate benefits products  that provide greater benefit and geographic flexibility to individual and employers such as through the vanbreda international acquisition  and further expansion of distribution capabilities to capitalize on emerging and growing markets globally 
the company plans to improve its strategic and financial flexibility by driving further reductions in its health care operating expenses  improving its medical cost competitiveness in targeted markets and effectively managing balance sheet exposures 
see the run off operations section below for further discussion of the company s actions to manage its balance sheet exposures 
the company s operational strategies are discussed further in the health care segment section of the md a beginning on page the company s ability to increase revenue  shareholders net income and operating cash flows from ongoing operations is directly related to progress on the execution of its strategy as described above as well as other key factors  including the company s ability to profitably price products and services at competitive levels that reflect emerging experience  cross sell its various health and related benefit products  invest available cash at attractive rates of return for appropriate durations  and effectively deploy capital 
cigna corporation form k 
back to contents in addition to the company specific factors cited above  overall results are influenced by a range of economic and other factors  especially cost trends and inflation for medical and related services  utilization patterns of medical and other services  employment levels  the tort liability system  developments in the political environment both domestically and internationally  including us health care reform  interest rates  equity market returns  foreign currency fluctuations and credit market volatility  including the availability and cost of credit in the future  and federal  state and international regulation 
the company regularly monitors the trends impacting operating results from the above mentioned key factors to appropriately respond to economic and other factors affecting its operations  both in its ongoing and run off operations 
run off operations the company s run off reinsurance operations have significant exposures  primarily for its guaranteed minimum death benefits gmdb  also known as vadbe and guaranteed minimum income benefits gmib products 
as part of its strategy to effectively manage these exposures  the company operates an equity hedge program to substantially reduce the impact of equity market movements on the liability for the gmdb business 
the company actively monitors the performance of the hedge program  and evaluates the cost benefit of hedging other risks  including interest rate risk 
these products are also influenced by a range of economic and behavioral factors that were not hedged as of december   including equity markets for gmib contracts  interest rates  future partial surrender elections for gmdb contracts  annuity election rates for guaranteed minimum income benefits gmib contracts  annuitant lapse rates  and the collection of amounts recoverable from retrocessionaires 
in order to manage these factors  the company actively studies policyholder behavior experience and adjusts future expectations based on the results of the studies  as warranted  implemented a partial hedge in february for a portion of the equity market risk for gmib contracts and a portion of the interest rate risk for gmdb and gmib contracts  and will continue to evaluate further adjustments to the hedging program  performs regular audits of ceding companies to ensure compliance with agreements as well as to help maximize the collection of receivables from retrocessionaires  and monitors the financial strength and credit standing of its retrocessionaires and establishes or collects collateral when warranted 
health care reform in the first quarter of  the patient protection and affordable care act  including the reconciliation act of  health care reform was signed into law 
health care reform mandates broad changes in the delivery of health care benefits that may impact the company s current business model  including its relationship with current and future customers  producers and health care providers  products  services  processes and technology 
health care reform includes  among others  provisions for mandatory coverage of benefits  a minimum medical loss ratio for insured business  eliminates lifetime and annual benefit limits and creates health insurance exchanges 
the provisions of the law take effect over the next several years from to many provisions of health care reform have become effective during  and interim final regulations have been issued  however there are still many provisions which have yet to become effective  and it is possible that the ultimate impact of health care reform could have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
the company is evaluating potential business opportunities resulting from health care reform that will enable it to leverage the strengths and capabilities of its broad health and wellness portfolio 
cigna corporation form k 
back to contents health care reform will require the assessment of fees and excise taxes on health services companies such as cigna and others in the health care industry to help fund the additional insurance benefits and coverages provided by this legislation 
the amount which the company will be required to pay starting in and for these fees and excise taxes will result in charges to the company s financial statements in future periods 
in addition  since these fees and excise taxes will not be tax deductible  the company s effective tax rate is expected to increase in future periods 
however  the company is unable to estimate the amount of these fees and excise taxes or the increase in the effective tax rate because guidance for the calculation has not been finalized 
health care reform also changes certain tax laws which affected the company s financial statements 
although these provisions do not become effective until  they are expected to limit the tax deductibility of certain future retiree benefit and compensation related payments earned after the company recorded after tax charges of approximately million for the twelve months ended december  related to these changes 
the company will continue to evaluate the impact of these tax laws as further guidance is made available 
during  the company incurred total after tax costs of approximately million related to health care reform comprised of million of additional income tax related to the impact of the tax law changes as described previously  and million of costs related to building the infrastructure necessary to comply with the provisions of health care reform which were effective in and of which million were incremental costs 
the remaining million reflected the estimated cost of internal staff redeployed to work on health care reform initiatives 
many provisions of health care reform are not effective until future years and the company will continue to implement these provisions 
on january   the minimum loss ratio became effective and will require payment of premium rebates beginning in to employers and customers covered under the company s comprehensive medical insurance if certain minimum medical loss ratios are not met 
management estimates charges for rebates to approximate million after tax for the year ending december  this estimate followed the most current regulatory guidance for the calculation of rebates and was developed using assumptions about the amount and distribution for claim experience  enrollment and premiums earned by state and market segment 
actual rebates could differ substantially from management s estimates if actual experience differs from the assumptions 
management is currently unable to estimate the full impact of health care reform on the company s future results of operations  and its financial condition and liquidity due to uncertainties related to interpretation  implementation and timing of its many provisions 
it is possible  however  that this impact could be material to future results of operations 
management  through its internal task force  continues to closely monitor implementation of the law  report on the company s compliance with health care reform  actively engage with regulators to assist with the ongoing conversion of legislation to regulation and assess potential opportunities arising from health care reform 
acquisitions and dispositions in line with its growth strategy  the company has strengthened its market position and reduced balance sheet exposures through the following acquisition and disposition transactions 
reinsurance of run off workers compensation and personal accident business on december   the company essentially exited from its workers compensation and personal accident reinsurance business by purchasing retrocessional coverage from a bermuda subsidiary of enstar group limited and transferring administration of this business to the reinsurer 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
sale of workers compensation and case management business on december  the company completed the sale of its workers compensation and case management business to genex holdings  inc the company recognized an after tax gain on sale of million million before tax which was reported in other revenues in the disability and life segment

initiatives to lower operating expenses as part of its strategy  the company has undertaken several initiatives to realign its organization and consolidate support functions in an effort to increase efficiency and responsiveness to customers and to reduce costs 
during and  the company conducted a comprehensive review to reduce certain operating expenses of its ongoing businesses cost reduction program 
as a result  the company recognized severance related and real estate charges in other operating expenses 
severance charges in and resulted from reductions of approximately  positions in the company s workforce 
cost reduction activities associated with these charges are substantially complete as of december  with severance expected to be paid by the end of the second quarter of in  the company recorded an incremental pre tax charge of million million after tax to reflect actual severance experience differing from prior assumptions 
cost reduction activity for  and was as follows in millions severance real estate total fourth quarter charge balance carried to january  second quarter third quarter fourth quarter subtotal charges less payments balance  december  add change in estimate to severance accrual less payments first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter balance  december  the health care segment reported substantially all of the charge  million pre tax million after tax of the charges and million pre tax million after tax of the charge 
the remainder of the and charges were reported as follows disability and life million pre tax million after tax in and million pre tax million after tax in  and international million pre tax million after tax in and million pre tax million after tax in the company expects annualized after tax savings from this cost reduction program to be approximately million in and beyond

adjusted income from operations is defined as consolidated segment earnings loss excluding special items defined below and the results of the gmib business 
adjusted income from operations is another measure of profitability used by the company s management because it presents the underlying results of operations of the company s businesses and permits analysis of trends in underlying revenue  expenses and shareholders net income 
this measure is not determined in accordance with gaap and should not be viewed as a substitute for the most directly comparable gaap measure  which is shareholders income from continuing operations

back to contents overview of consolidated results of operations adjusted income from operations increased in compared with primarily due to strong earnings growth in the ongoing business segments health care  disability and life and international  reflecting focused execution of the company s strategy  which includes a growing global customer base as well as higher net investment income reflecting improved economic conditions and asset growth 
see the individual segment sections of this md a for further discussion 
shareholders income from continuing operations increased in compared with  reflecting strong growth in adjusted income from operations as explained above as well as significant improvement in realized investment results  partially offset by a loss in the gmib business in compared with a significant gain in see the run off reinsurance section of the md a beginning on page for additional information on gmib results 
overview of consolidated results of operations adjusted income from operations increased in compared with primarily reflecting significantly improved results in the run off reinsurance segment due to a lower amount of reserve strengthening required for the gmdb business in compared with this result was primarily due to improved equity market conditions in also  in the aggregate  adjusted income from operations from the company s ongoing operating segments health care  disability and life  and international improved slightly in over these favorable effects were partially offset by higher unallocated costs including interest reported in corporate 
shareholders income from continuing operations for the year ended december  was significantly higher than  reflecting improved adjusted income from operations  as explained above  as well as the following substantially improved results in the gmib business due to improved equity market conditions and generally higher interest rates  improved realized investment results  also reflecting better market conditions during  and the favorable year over year impact of the following special items as detailed in the table above completion of the irs examination  the curtailment gain on the pension plan  and the absence of litigation charges in special items and gmib management does not believe that the special items noted in the table above are representative of the company s underlying results of operations 
accordingly  the company excluded these special items from adjusted income from operations in order to facilitate an understanding and comparison of results of operations and permit analysis of trends in underlying revenue  expenses and shareholders income from continuing operations 
special items for included a gain resulting from the resolution of a federal income tax matter  consisting of a million release of a deferred tax valuation allowance and million of accrued interest

cigna corporation form k 
back to contents the company also excludes the results of the gmib business from adjusted income from operations because the fair value of gmib assets and liabilities must be recalculated each quarter using updated capital market assumptions 
the resulting changes in fair value  which are reported in shareholders net income  are volatile and unpredictable 
see the critical accounting estimates section of the md a beginning on page of this form k for more information on the effect of capital market assumption changes on shareholders net income 
because of this volatility  and since the gmib business is in run off  management does not believe that its results are meaningful in assessing underlying results of operations 
the loss for the gmib business in primarily reflects the impact of declining interest rates  partially offset by favorable equity market performance  whereas the gain in primarily reflected increases in interest rates combined with favorable equity market performance 
see the run off reinsurance section of the md a beginning on page for further information on the gmib business 
outlook for the company expects adjusted income from operations to be approximately level with this outlook includes an assumption that gmdb also known as vadbe results will be approximately break even for  which assumes that actual experience  including capital market performance  will be consistent with long term reserve assumptions 
see note to the consolidated financial statements and the critical accounting estimates section of this md a beginning on page for more information on the potential effect of capital market and other assumption changes on shareholders net income 
information is not available for management to reasonably estimate the future results of the gmib business or realized investment results due in part to interest rate and stock market volatility and other internal and external factors 
in addition  the company is not able to identify or reasonably estimate the financial impact of special items in however they may include potential adjustments associated with cost reduction  litigation  tax and assessment related matters 
the company s outlook for is subject to the factors cited above and in the cautionary statement beginning on page of this form k and the sensitivities discussed in the critical accounting estimates section of the md a beginning on page of this form k 
if unfavorable equity market and interest rate movements occur  the company could experience losses related to investment impairments and the gmib and gmdb businesses 
these losses could adversely impact the company s consolidated results of operations and financial condition by potentially reducing the capital of the company s insurance subsidiaries and reducing their dividend paying capabilities

excluding the impact of the futures contracts associated with the gmdb equity hedge program  other revenues decreased in  compared with  primarily reflecting declines in amortization of deferred gains on the sales of the retirement benefits and individual life insurance and annuity business 
realized investment results realized investment results in were significantly higher than in primarily due to lower impairments on fixed maturities and real estate funds in  increased prepayment fees on fixed maturities received in as a result of favorable market conditions and issuer specific business circumstances  and gains on sales of real estate held in joint ventures and other investments in these favorable effects were partially offset by an increase in commercial mortgage loan impairments recorded in  reflecting continued weakness in the commercial real estate market

back to contents critical accounting estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements 
management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material effect on the company s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the company s board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosures presented below 
in addition to the estimates presented in the following table  there are other accounting estimates used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements  including estimates of liabilities for future policy benefits other than those identified in the following table  as well as estimates with respect to goodwill  unpaid claims and claim expenses  postemployment and postretirement benefits other than pensions  certain compensation accruals  and income taxes 
management believes the current assumptions used to estimate amounts reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements are appropriate 
however  if actual experience differs from the assumptions used in estimating amounts reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements  the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated results of operations  and in certain situations  could have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity and financial condition 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on significant accounting policies that impact the company 
balance sheet caption nature of critical accounting estimate assumptions approach used effect if different assumptions used future policy benefits guaranteed minimum death benefits gmdb also known as vadbe these liabilities are estimates of the present value of net amounts expected to be paid  less the present value of net future premiums expected to be received 
the amounts to be paid represent the excess of the guaranteed death benefit over the values of contractholders accounts 
the death benefit coverage in force at december  representing the amount payable if all of approximately  contractholders had submitted death claims as of that date was approximately billion 
liabilities for future policy benefits for these contracts as of december were as follows in millions the company estimates these liabilities based on assumptions for lapse  partial surrender  claim mortality deaths that result in claims  interest rates mean investment performance and discount rate  and volatility 
these assumptions are based on the company s experience and future expectations over the long term period 
the company monitors actual experience to update these estimates as necessary 
lapse the full surrender of an annuity prior to a contractholder s death 
partial surrender most contractholders have the ability to withdraw substantially all of their mutual fund investments while retaining death benefit coverage in effect at withdrawal 
a partial surrender causes the value of the reinsured liability to increase reflecting lower future assumed premiums  a lower likelihood of lapse  and a lower likelihood that account values will recover sufficiently to reduce the death benefit exposure in the future 
these effects are not covered by the company s gmdb equity hedge program 
market declines expose the company to higher death benefit exposure and higher anticipated election rates of future partial surrenders 
thus  if equity markets decline  the company s liability for partial surrenders increases and there is no corresponding offset from the hedge program 
the election rate for expected future partial surrenders is updated quarterly based on emerging experience 
interest rates include both a the mean investment performance assumption  and b the liability discount rate assumption 
the mean investment performance for underlying equity mutual funds considers the company s gmdb equity hedge program which reflects the average short term interest rate to be earned over the life of the program and considers the current low level of interest rates 
the mean investment performance for underlying fixed income mutual funds considers the expected market return over the life of the contracts 
volatility the degree of variation of future market returns of the underlying mutual fund investments 
current assumptions used to estimate these liabilities are detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
based on current and historical market  industry and company specific experience and management s judgment  the company believes that it is reasonably likely that the unfavorable changes in the key assumptions and or conditions described below could occur 
if these unfavorable assumption changes were to occur  the approximate after tax decrease in shareholders net income would be as follows increase in claim mortality rates million  decrease in lapse rates million  increase in election rates for future partial surrenders million  basis point decrease in interest rates mean investment performance million  discount rate million  increase in volatility million 
as of december   if contractholder account values invested in underlying equity mutual funds declined by due to equity market performance  the after tax decrease in shareholders net income resulting from an increase in the provision for partial surrenders would be approximately million 
as of december   if contractholder account values invested in underlying bond money market mutual funds declined by due to bond money market performance  the after tax decrease in shareholders net income resulting from an increase in the provision for partial surrenders and an increase in unhedged exposure would be approximately million 
the amounts would be reflected in the run off reinsurance segment

back to contents balance sheet caption nature of critical accounting estimate assumptions approach used effect if different assumptions used health care medical claims payable medical claims payable for the health care segment include both reported claims and estimates for losses incurred but not yet reported 
liabilities for medical claims payable as of december were as follows in millions gross  net  gross  net these liabilities are presented above both gross and net of reinsurance and other recoverables 
these liabilities generally exclude amounts for administrative services only business 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
the company develops estimates for health care medical claims payable using actuarial principles and assumptions consistently applied each reporting period  and recognizes the actuarial best estimate of the ultimate liability within a level of confidence  as required by actuarial standards of practice  which require that the liabilities be adequate under moderately adverse conditions 
the liability is primarily calculated using completion factors a measure of the time to process claims  which are developed by comparing the date claims were incurred  generally the date services were provided  to the date claims were paid 
the company uses historical completion factors combined with an analysis of current trends and operational factors to develop current estimates of completion factors 
the company estimates the liability for claims incurred in each month by applying the current estimates of completion factors to the current paid claims data 
this approach implicitly assumes that historical completion rates will be a useful indicator for the current period 
it is possible that the actual completion rates for the current period will develop differently from historical patterns  which could have a material impact on the company s medical claims payable and shareholders net income 
completion factors are impacted by several key items including changes in electronic auto adjudication versus manual claim processing  provider claims submission rates  membership and the mix of products 
in addition  for the more recent months  the company also relies on medical cost trend analysis  which reflects expected claim payment patterns and other relevant operational considerations 
medical cost trend is primarily impacted by medical service utilization and unit costs  which are affected by changes in the level and mix of medical benefits offered  including inpatient  outpatient and pharmacy  the impact of copays and deductibles  changes in provider practices and changes in consumer demographics and consumption behavior 
despite reflecting both historical and emerging trends in setting reserves  it is possible that the actual medical trend for the current period will develop differently from the expected  which could have a material impact on the company s medical claims payable and shareholders net income 
for each reporting period  the company evaluates key assumptions by comparing the assumptions used in establishing the medical claims payable to actual experience 
when actual experience differs from the assumptions used in establishing the liability  medical claims payable are increased or decreased through current period shareholders net income 
additionally  the company evaluates expected future developments and emerging trends which may impact key assumptions 
the estimation process involves considerable judgment  reflecting the variability inherent in forecasting future claim payments 
these estimates are highly sensitive to changes in the company s key assumptions  specifically completion factors  and medical cost trends 
for the year ended december   actual experience differed from the company s key assumptions as of december   resulting in million of favorable incurred claims related to prior years medical claims payable or of the current year incurred claims as reported for the year ended december  for the year ended december   actual experience differed from the company s key assumptions as of december   resulting in million of favorable incurred claims related to prior years medical claims  or of the current year incurred claims reported for the year ended december  specifically  the favorable impact is due to faster than expected completion factors and lower than expected medical cost trends  both of which included an assumption for moderately adverse experience 
the impact of this favorable prior year development was an increase to shareholders net income of million after tax million pre tax for the year ended december  the change in the amount of the incurred claims related to prior years in the medical claims payable liability does not directly correspond to an increase or decrease in shareholders net income as explained in note to the consolidated financial statements

back to contents balance sheet caption nature of critical accounting estimate assumptions approach used effect if different assumptions used accounts payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities  and other assets  including other intangibles guaranteed minimum income benefits these liabilities are calculated with a complex internal model using many scenarios to determine the fair value of amounts estimated to be paid  less the fair value of net future premiums estimated to be received  adjusted for risk and profit charges that the company anticipates a hypothetical market participant would require to assume this business 
the amounts estimated to be paid represent the excess of the anticipated value of the income benefit over the value of the annuitants accounts at the time of annuitization 
the assets associated with these contracts represent receivables in connection with reinsurance that the company has purchased from two external reinsurers  which covers of the exposures on these contracts 
liabilities related to these contracts as of december  were as follows in millions as of december  estimated amounts receivable related to these contracts from two external reinsurers  were as follows in millions the company considers the various assumptions used to estimate the fair values of assets and liabilities associated with these contracts in two categories capital market inputs  and future annuitant behavior and other assumptions 
capital market inputs include market returns and discount rates  claim interest rates and market volatility 
this group of assumptions is largely based on market observable inputs 
interest rates include a market returns  b the liability discount rate assumption and c the projected interest rates used to calculate the reinsured income benefit at the time of annuitization claim interest rate 
volatility the degree of variation of future market returns of the underlying mutual fund investments 
future annuitant behavior and other inputs these assumptions include annuity election rates  lapse  mortality  nonperformance risk for both the company and its retrocessionaires  and a risk and profit charge 
this group of assumptions is based on the company s experience  industry data  and management s judgment 
annuity election rates the proportion of annuitants who elect to receive their income benefit as an annuity 
lapse the full surrender of an annuity prior to annuitization of the policy 
nonperformance risk the market s perception that either the company will not fulfill its gmib liability own credit or the company will not collect on its gmib retrocessional coverage reinsurer credit risk 
risk and profit charge the amount that a hypothetical market participant would include in the valuation to cover the uncertainty of outcomes and the desired return on capital 
current assumptions used to estimate these liabilities are detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s results of operations are expected to be volatile in future periods because most capital market assumptions will be based largely on market observable inputs at the close of each period including interest rates and market implied volatilities 
based on current and historical market  industry and company specific experience and management s judgment  the company believes that it is reasonably likely that the unfavorable changes in the key assumptions and or conditions described below could occur 
if these unfavorable assumption changes were to occur  the approximate after tax decrease in shareholders net income  net of estimated amounts receivable from reinsurers  would be as follows basis point decrease in interest rates which are aligned with libor used for projecting market returns and discounting million  basis point decrease in interest rates used for projecting claim exposure year treasury rates million  increase in implied market volatility million  decrease in mortality million  increase in annuity election rates million  decrease in lapse rates million  increase to the risk and profit charge million 
market declines expose the company to a larger net liability 
decreases in annuitants account values resulting from a equity market decline could decrease shareholders net income by approximately million 
decreases in annuitants account values resulting from a decline due to bond money market performance could decrease shareholders net income by approximately million 
if credit default swap spreads used to evaluate the nonperformance risk of the company were to narrow or the credit rating of its principal life insurance subsidiary were to improve  it would cause a decrease in the discount rate of the gmib liability  resulting in an unfavorable impact to earnings 
if the discount rate decreased by bps due to this  the decrease in shareholders net income would be approximately million

back to contents balance sheet caption nature of critical accounting estimate assumptions approach used effect if different assumptions used accounts payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities  and other assets including other intangibles guaranteed minimum income benefits continued if credit default swap spreads used to evaluate the nonperformance risk of the company s gmib retrocessionaires were to widen or the retrocessionaires credit ratings were to weaken  it would cause an increase in the discount rate of the gmib asset  resulting in an unfavorable impact to earnings 
if the discount rate increased by bps due to this  the decrease in shareholders net income would be approximately million 
all of these estimated impacts due to unfavorable changes in assumptions could vary from quarter to quarter depending on actual reserve levels  the actual market conditions or changes in the anticipated view of a hypothetical market participant as of any future valuation date 
the amounts would be reflected in the run off reinsurance segment in gmib expense 
accounts payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities pension liabilities these liabilities are estimates of the present value of the qualified and nonqualified pension benefits to be paid attributed to employee service to date net of the fair value of plan assets 
the accrued pension benefit liability as of december was as follows in millions see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
the company estimates these liabilities and the related expense with actuarial models using various assumptions including discount rates and an expected long term return on plan assets 
discount rates are set by applying actual annualized yields at various durations from the citigroup pension liability curve  without adjustment  to the expected cash flows of the pension liabilities 
the expected long term return on plan assets for the domestic qualified pension plan is developed considering actual historical returns  expected long term market conditions  plan asset mix and management s investment strategy 
in addition  to measure pension costs the company uses a market related asset value method for domestic qualified pension plan assets invested in non fixed income investments  which are approximately of total plan assets 
this method recognizes the difference between actual and expected returns in the non fixed income portfolio over years  a method that reduces the short term impact of market fluctuations on pension cost 
at december   the market related asset value was approximately billion compared with a market value of billion 
the accumulated unrecognized actuarial loss of billion at december  primarily reflects the significant decline in the value of equity securities during and  to a lesser extent  a decline in the discount rate and change in mortality assumption during the actuarial loss is adjusted for unrecognized changes in market related asset values and amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants if the adjusted loss exceeds of the market related value of plan assets or of the projected benefit obligation  whichever is greater 
as of december   approximately billion of the adjusted actuarial loss exceeded of the projected benefit obligation 
as a result  approximately million after tax of the unrecognized loss will be expensed in shareholders net income 
for the year ended december   million after tax of the unrecognized loss was expensed in shareholders net income 
using past experience  the company expects that it is reasonably possible that a favorable or unfavorable change in these key assumptions of basis points could occur 
an unfavorable change is a decrease in these key assumptions with resulting impacts as discussed below 
if discount rates for the qualified and nonqualified pension plans decreased by basis points annual pension costs for would decrease by approximately million  after tax  and the accrued pension benefit liability would increase by approximately million as of december  resulting in an after tax decrease to shareholders equity of approximately million as of december  if the expected long term return on domestic qualified pension plan assets decreased by basis points  annual pension costs for would increase by approximately million after tax 
if the company used the market value of assets to measure pension costs as opposed to the market related value  annual pension cost for would increase by approximately million after tax 
if the december  fair values of domestic qualified plan assets decreased by  the accrued pension benefit liability would increase by approximately million as of december  resulting in an after tax decrease to shareholders equity of approximately million 
an increase in these key assumptions would result in impacts to annual pension costs  the accrued pension liability and shareholders equity in an opposite direction  but similar amounts

back to contents balance sheet caption nature of critical accounting estimate assumptions approach used effect if different assumptions used investments fixed maturities recognition of losses from other than temporary impairments of public and private placement fixed maturities to assess whether a fixed maturity s decline in fair value below its amortized cost is other than temporary  the company evaluates the expected recovery in value and its intent to sell or the likelihood of a required sale of the fixed maturity prior to an expected recovery 
when the company does not expect to recover a fixed maturity s amortized cost  its fair value and expected future cash flows must be estimated by management to record an impairment loss 
the credit portion of an impairment loss is recognized in shareholders net income and measured as the difference between a fixed maturity s amortized cost and the net present value of its projected future cash flows 
the non credit portion  if any  is recognized in a separate component of shareholders equity 
see note c to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the company s accounting policies for fixed maturities 
when evaluating whether a loss is other than temporary  the company considers factors including length of time and severity of decline  financial health and specific near term prospects of the issuer  changes in the regulatory  economic or general market environment of the issuer s industry or geographic region  and the company s intent to sell or the likelihood of a required sale prior to recovery 
management estimates other than temporary impairments based on fair values using quoted market prices for public securities with active markets and generally the present value of future cash flows for private placement bonds and other public securities 
expected future cash flows for each fixed maturity are based on the company s assessment of qualitative and quantitative factors  including the probability of default  and the estimated timing and amount of any recovery in value 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the company s fair value measurements 
the company recognized other than temporary impairments of investments in fixed maturities as follows in millions  after tax see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the company s review of declines in fair value 
for all fixed maturities with cost in excess of their fair value  if this excess was determined to be other than temporary  shareholders net income for the year ended december  would have decreased by approximately million after tax 
for private placement bonds considered impaired  a decrease of of all expected future cash flows for the impaired bonds would reduce shareholders net income by less than million after tax

when it is probable that the company will not collect amounts due according to the terms of the original loan agreement  a loan is considered impaired and the company must estimate the fair value of the underlying property to measure an impairment loss 
an impairment loss is recorded using a valuation allowance for an impaired commercial mortgage loan s carrying value in excess of the estimated fair value of its underlying property 
changes to valuation reserves are recorded in realized investment gains losses 
see note c to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the company s accounting policies for commercial mortgage loans 
the company s evaluation of the likelihood of collecting all contractual payments and the collateral fair value for commercial mortgage loans is a qualitative and quantitative process which is subject to uncertainties 
the company carefully evaluates all facts and circumstances for each loan and its supporting collateral 
when evaluating the likelihood of collecting the contractual payments of a commercial mortgage loan  the company considers factors including financial statements  budgets and operating plans for the property  inspection reports of the property completed by third party servicers  debt service coverage and loan to value ratio of the underlying collateral  the borrower s continuing financial commitment to the property  and conditions and factors pertinent to the property and its local market 
when it becomes probable that all contractual payments will not be collected according to the terms of the original loan agreement  the company calculates the estimated fair value of the underlying property based on a year discounted cash flow analysis 
factors key to this valuation include the following net operating income of the property  rental and growth rates for the property and its local market  capital requirements for the property  and current market discount and capitalization rates 
these evaluations are based primarily on an in depth review of the commercial mortgage loan portfolio which is completed annually in the third quarter 
the company updates this annual review as material changes in these factors are identified 
the company recognized impairment losses from commercial mortgage loan valuation reserves as follows in millions  after tax see the investment assets section of the md a beginning on page for discussion of the company s problem and potential problem mortgage loans and note to the consolidated financial statements for further information surrounding impaired commercial mortgage loans 
if loans with carrying values in excess of the fair value of their underlying property were considered impaired as of december   shareholders net income would decrease by approximately million after tax 
if property values declined by across the commercial mortgage loan portfolio as of december   approximately of the portfolio s loans would have carrying values in excess of their underlying properties fair values totaling approximately million 
and if each of these loans were considered impaired as of december   shareholders net income would decrease by approximately million after tax

the company also provides the effects of hypothetical changes in those assumptions in the critical accounting estimates section of the md a beginning on page of this form k 
the company excludes the results of the gmib business from adjusted income from operations because the fair value of gmib assets and liabilities must be recalculated each quarter using updated capital market assumptions

the company held futures contract positions related to this program with a notional amount of billion at december  benefits and expenses benefits and expenses were comprised of the following in millions gmib fair value gain loss other benefits and expenses benefits and expenses gmib fair value gain loss 
under the gaap guidance for fair value measurements  the company s results of operations are expected to be volatile in future periods because capital market assumptions needed to estimate the assets and liabilities for the gmib business are based largely on market observable inputs at the close of each reporting period including interest rates libor swap curve and market implied volatilities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about assumptions and asset and liability balances related to gmib 
gmib fair value losses of million for  were primarily due to declining interest rates  partially offset by increases in underlying account values resulting from favorable equity and bond fund returns  which result in decreased exposures 
gmib fair value gains of million for  were primarily due to increases in interest rates and increases in underlying account values in the period resulting from favorable equity market and bond fund returns  resulting in reduced exposures 
these favorable effects were partially offset by increases to the annuitization assumption and updates to the lapse assumptions 
gmib fair value losses of million for include a pre tax charge of million for the adoption of the fasb s fair value disclosure and measurement guidance  which is discussed in notes b and to the consolidated financial statements 
excluding the charge on adoption  the gmib fair value losses of million were primarily due to declines in interest rates  the impact of declines in underlying account values driven by declines in equity markets and bond fund returns  resulting in increased exposures  and unfavorable annuitization and lapse experience 
the gmib liabilities and related assets are calculated using a complex internal model and assumptions from the viewpoint of a hypothetical market participant 
this resulting liability and related asset is higher than the company believes will ultimately be required to settle claims primarily because market observable interest rates are used to project growth in account values of the underlying mutual funds to estimate fair value from the viewpoint of a hypothetical market participant 
the company s payments for gmib claims are expected to occur over the next to years and will be based on actual values of the underlying mutual funds and the year treasury rate at the dates benefits are elected 
management does not believe that current market observable interest rates reflect actual growth expected for the underlying mutual funds over that timeframe  and therefore believes that the recorded liability and related asset do not represent what management believes will ultimately be required as this business runs off 
however  significant declines in mutual fund values that underlie the contracts increasing the exposure to the company together with declines in the year treasury rates used to determine claim payments similar to what occurred periodically during the last few years would increase the expected amount of claims that would be paid out for contractholders who choose to annuitize 
it is also possible that such unfavorable market conditions would have an impact on the level of contractholder annuitizations  particularly if these unfavorable market conditions persisted for an extended period

as explained in other revenues above  these changes do not affect shareholders net income because they are offset by gains or losses on futures contracts used to hedge equity market performance 
gmdb reserve strengthening the following highlights the impacts of gmdb reserve strengthening primarily reflects management s consideration of the anticipated impact of the continued low level of current short term interest rates and  to a lesser extent  a reduction in assumed lapse rates for policies that have taken or are assumed to take significant partial withdrawals 
primarily due to an increase in the provision for future partial surrenders due to overall market declines  adverse volatility related impacts due to turbulent equity market conditions and adverse interest rate impacts 
primarily due to the adverse impacts of overall market declines  volatility related impacts due to turbulent equity market conditions  and to a lesser extent  adverse interest rate impacts 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about assumptions and reserve balances related to gmdb 
other  including operating expenses the increases were due to the reduced favorable impacts of reserve studies in each successive year  and additionally for  the reduced impact of favorable settlements and commutations 
segment summary the company s payment obligations for underlying reinsurance exposures assumed by the company under these contracts are based on ceding companies claim payments 
for gmdb and gmib  claim payments vary because of changes in equity markets and interest rates  as well as mortality and policyholder behavior 
any of these claim payments can extend many years into the future  and the amount of the ceding companies ultimate claims  and therefore the amount of the company s ultimate payment obligations and corresponding ultimate collection from retrocessionaires may not be known with certainty for some time 
the company s reserves for underlying reinsurance exposures assumed by the company  as well as for amounts recoverable from retrocessionaires  are considered appropriate as of december   based on current information 
however  it is possible that future developments  which could include but are not limited to worse than expected claim experience and higher than expected volatility  could have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated results of operations and could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition 
the company bears the risk of loss if its payment obligations to cedents increase or if its retrocessionaires are unable to meet  or successfully challenge  their reinsurance obligations to the company

contractual cash obligations for insurance liabilities  excluding unearned premiums and fees  represent estimated net benefit payments for health  life and disability insurance policies and annuity contracts 
recorded contractholder deposit funds reflect current fund balances primarily from universal life customers 
contractual cash obligations for these universal life contracts are estimated by projecting future payments using assumptions for lapse  withdrawal and mortality 
these projected future payments include estimated future interest crediting on current fund balances based on current investment yields less the estimated cost of insurance charges and mortality and administrative fees 
actual obligations in any single year will vary based on actual morbidity  mortality  lapse  withdrawal  investment and premium experience 
the sum of the obligations presented above exceeds the corresponding insurance and contractholder liabilities of billion recorded on the balance sheet because the recorded insurance liabilities reflect discounting for interest and the recorded contractholder liabilities exclude future interest crediting  charges and fees 
the company manages its investment portfolios to generate cash flows needed to satisfy contractual obligations 
any shortfall from expected investment yields could result in increases to recorded reserves and adversely impact results of operations 
the amounts associated with the sold retirement benefits and individual life insurance and annuity businesses  as well as the reinsured workers compensation and personal accident businesses are excluded from the table above as net cash flows associated with them are not expected to impact the company

fair values are based on quoted market prices when available 
when market prices are not available  fair value is generally estimated using discounted cash flow analyses  incorporating current market inputs for similar financial instruments with comparable terms and credit quality 
in instances where there is little or no market activity for the same or similar instruments  the company estimates fair value using methods  models and assumptions that the company believes a hypothetical market participant would use to determine a current transaction price 
the company performs ongoing analyses of prices used to value the company s invested assets to determine that they represent appropriate estimates of fair value 
this process involves quantitative and qualitative analysis including reviews of pricing methodologies  judgments of valuation inputs  the significance of any unobservable inputs  pricing statistics and trends 
the company also performs sample testing of sales values to confirm the accuracy of prior fair value estimates

the majority of the bonds that are below investment grade are rated at the higher end of the non investment grade spectrum 
these quality characteristics have not materially changed during the year 
the net appreciation of the company s fixed maturity portfolio increased nearly million during  driven by a decline in market yields 
although asset values are well in excess of amortized cost  there are specific securities with amortized cost in excess of fair value by approximately million as of december  corporate fixed maturities includes private placement investments of billion  which are generally less marketable than publicly traded bonds  but yields on these investments tend to be higher than yields on publicly traded bonds with comparable credit risk 
the company performs a credit analysis of each issuer  diversifies investments by industry and issuer and requires financial and other covenants that allow the company to monitor issuers for deteriorating financial strength and pursue remedial actions  if warranted 
the company s investment in state and local government securities is diversified by issuer and geography with no single exposure greater than million

commercial mortgage loans the company s commercial mortgage loans are fixed rate loans  diversified by property type  location and borrower to reduce exposure to potential losses 
loans are secured by high quality commercial property and are generally made at less than of the property s value at origination of the loan 
in addition to property value  debt service coverage  which is the ratio of the estimated cash flows from the property to the required loan payments principal and interest  is an important underwriting consideration 
the company holds no direct residential mortgage loans and does not securitize or service mortgage loans 
the company completed its annual in depth review of its commercial mortgage loan portfolio in july  this review included an analysis of each property s most recent annual financial statements  rent rolls and operating plans and budgets for  a physical inspection of the property and other pertinent factors 
based on property values and cash flows estimated as part of this review  along with updates for portfolio activity subsequent to the review  the portfolio s average loan to value ratio improved to as of december  from as of december  the portfolio s debt service coverage was estimated to be as of december   down from as of december  values estimated for the properties in cigna s mortgage portfolio reflect improving commercial real estate capital markets  with stabilizing  and in some instances  increasing values  for well leased  quality commercial real estate located in strong institutional markets  the quality reflected by the vast majority of properties securing the mortgages 
the deterioration in property cash flows and resulting debt service coverage levels estimated as part of the review reflects generally weak fundamentals higher vacancy and reduced rental rates across property types and markets 
while commercial real estate capital markets improved during and there are some signs of improvement in fundamentals  a sustained recovery will be dependent on continued improvement in local markets and the broader national economy

back to contents the following table reflects the commercial mortgage loan portfolio as of december  summarized by loan to value ratio based on the annual loan review completed in july  loan to value distribution loan to value ratios amortized cost of mortgage loans senior subordinated total below to to to to to or above totals as summarized above  million or of the commercial mortgage loan portfolio is comprised of subordinated notes and loans  including million of loans secured by first mortgages  which were fully underwritten and originated by the company using its standard underwriting procedures 
senior interests in these first mortgage loans were then sold to other institutional investors 
this strategy allowed the company to effectively utilize its origination capabilities to underwrite high quality loans with strong borrower sponsorship  limit individual loan exposures  and achieve attractive risk adjusted yields 
in the event of a default  the company would pursue remedies up to and including foreclosure jointly with the holders of the senior interests  but would receive repayment only after satisfaction of the senior interest 
there are seven loans where the aggregate carrying value of the mortgage loans exceeds the value of the underlying properties by million 
five of these loans have current debt service coverage of or greater and two with debt service coverage below have other risk mitigating factors including strong borrower sponsorship 
as of december   the mortgage portfolio contains approximately loans and all but four of these loans totaling million and considered problem commercial mortgage loans continue to perform under their contractual terms  resulting in an aggregate default rate of 
the company has million of loans maturing in the next twelve months 
given the quality and diversity of the underlying real estate  positive debt service coverage and significant borrower cash investment averaging nearly  the company remains confident that the vast majority of borrowers will continue to perform as required 
while considered unlikely  if property values were to decrease from those levels estimated during the annual in depth loan review  this would cause approximately of the portfolio s carrying values to exceed the fair values of their underlying properties  totaling million 
other long term investments the company s other long term investments include million in securities partnership and real estate funds as well as direct investments in real estate joint ventures 
the funds typically invest in mezzanine debt or equity of privately held companies securities partnerships and equity real estate 
because these investments have a subordinate position in the capital structure  the company assumes a higher level of risk for higher expected returns 
although the total fair values of these investments exceeded their carrying values as of december   the fair value of the company s ownership interest in certain funds those carried at cost was less than its carrying value by million 
during these investment values improved  but remained at depressed levels reflecting the impact of declines in value experienced predominantly during and due to economic weakness and disruption in the capital markets  particularly in the commercial real estate market 
the company believes these declines in value are temporary and expects to recover its carrying value over the remaining lives of the funds 
to mitigate risk  these investments are diversified across approximately separate partnerships  and approximately general partners who manage one or more of these partnerships 
also  the funds underlying investments are diversified by industry sector or property type  and geographic region 
no single investment exceeds of the company s securities and real estate partnership portfolio 
given the current economic environment  future impairments are possible  however  management does not expect those losses to have a material effect on the company s results of operations  financial condition or liquidity

back to contents problem and potential problem investments problem bonds and commercial mortgage loans are either delinquent by days or more or have been restructured as to terms  which could include concessions by the company for modification of interest rate  principal payment or maturity date 
potential problem bonds and commercial mortgage loans are considered current no payment more than days past due  but management believes they have certain characteristics that increase the likelihood that they may become problems 
the characteristics management considers include  but are not limited to  the following request from the borrower for restructuring  principal or interest payments past due by more than but fewer than days  downgrade in credit rating  collateral losses on asset backed securities  and for commercial mortgages  deterioration of debt service coverage below or value declines resulting in estimated loan to value ratios increasing to or more 
the company recognizes interest income on problem bonds and commercial mortgage loans only when payment is actually received because of the risk profile of the underlying investment 
the amount that would have been reflected in net income if interest on non accrual investments had been recognized in accordance with the original terms was not significant for or the following table shows problem and potential problem investments at amortized cost  net of valuation reserves and write downs in millions december  december  gross reserve net gross reserve net problem bonds problem commercial mortgage loans foreclosed real estate total problem investments potential problem bonds potential problem commercial mortgage loans total potential problem investments net problem investments represent of total investments excluding policy loans 
the company actively managed its problem asset exposure during net problem investments decreased million during reflecting million reduction from the foreclosure and subsequent sale or partial sale of three assets 
these partial sales represented assets transferred to joint ventures and recapitalized with contributions of new equity from third party investors  resulting in the reclassification of the retained ownership interests in these assets from foreclosed real estate to other long term investments  million reduction to problem bonds due to redemption activity  and million of additions related to two new problem mortgage loans 
additionally  two mortgage loans totaling million were identified as problem loans in and subsequently disposed of through a direct sale and a partial sale subsequent to foreclosure 
realized investment gains and losses from the disposal of problem assets were not material to the company s results of operations 
cigna corporation form k 
back to contents net potential problem investments represent of total investments excluding policy loans 
net potential problem investments increased million during reflecting million increase due to the addition of eight commercial mortgage loans  five of which were identified as a result of management s in depth portfolio loan review completed in july these loans were exhibiting signs of distress such as an elevated loan to value ratio or a low or negative debt service coverage 
seven of the loans continue to perform according to their original contractual terms as of december   while one of the loans was reclassified to problem status  million reduction for commercial mortgage loans that were sold  foreclosed  reclassified to problem commercial mortgage loans or paid down  million reduction for commercial mortgage loans that were reclassified to loans in good standing  and million decline in potential problem bonds due to improved bond performance as well as redemption activity 
commercial mortgage loans are considered impaired when it is probable that the company will not collect amounts due according to the terms of the original loan agreement 
problem and potential problem commercial mortgage loans totaling million net of valuation reserves  presented in the above table  are considered impaired 
during  the company recorded a million pre tax million after tax charge to increase valuation reserves on impaired commercial mortgage loans 
see note to the consolidated financial statements and the critical accounting estimates section of the md a beginning on page of this form k for additional information regarding impaired commercial mortgage loans 
summary the company recorded after tax realized investment losses for investment asset write downs and changes in valuation reserves as follows in millions credit related other total credit related losses include other than temporary declines in value of fixed maturities and equity securities  and impairments of commercial mortgage loans and real estate entities 
the amount related to credit losses on fixed maturities for which a portion of the impairment was recognized in other comprehensive income was not significant 
prior to adoption of new gaap guidance for other than temporary impairments on april   other primarily represented the impact of rising market yields on investments where the company could not demonstrate the intent and ability to hold until recovery 
other than temporary impairments on fixed maturities in were not significant 
other than temporary impairments on fixed maturities in were million and are included in both the credit related and other categories above 
the financial credit markets improved during  with appreciation in asset values reflecting lower market yields 
in the current economic environment  risks in the company s investment portfolio  while declining  remain elevated 
continued economic weakness for an extended period could cause default rates to increase and recoveries to decline resulting in additional impairment losses for the company 
future realized and unrealized investment results will be impacted largely by future market conditions that are not reasonably predictable 
management believes that the vast majority of the company s fixed maturity investments will continue to perform under their contractual terms  and that declines in their fair values below carrying value are temporary 
based on the strategy to match the duration of invested assets to the duration of insurance and contractholder liabilities  the company expects to hold a significant portion of these assets for the long term 
while future credit related losses could have a material adverse impact on results of operations  such losses are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or liquidity 
while management believes the commercial mortgage loan portfolio is positioned to perform well due to its solid aggregate loan to value ratio including minimal loans with carrying values exceeding the fair value of collateral and strong debt service coverage  the commercial real estate market continues to exhibit significant signs of distress and if these conditions remain for an extended period or worsen substantially  it could result in an increase in problem and potential problem loans 
given the current economic environment  future impairments could have a material adverse effect on results of operations  however  management does not expect those losses to have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or liquidity

back to contents market risk financial instruments the company s assets and liabilities include financial instruments subject to the risk of potential losses from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
the company s primary market risk exposures are interest rate risk on fixed rate  domestic  medium term instruments 
changes in market interest rates affect the value of instruments that promise a fixed return and impact the value of liabilities for reinsured gmdb and gmib contracts 
foreign currency exchange rate risk of the us dollar primarily to the south korean won  euro  taiwan dollar  british pound  new zealand dollar  and hong kong dollar 
an unfavorable change in exchange rates reduces the carrying value of net assets denominated in foreign currencies 
equity price risk for domestic equity securities and for the value of reinsured gmdb and gmib contracts resulting from unfavorable changes in variable annuity account values based on underlying mutual fund investments 
for further discussion of reinsured contracts  see note for gmdb contracts and note for gmib contracts in the consolidated financial statements 
the company s management of market risks the company predominantly relies on three techniques to manage its exposure to market risk investment liability matching 
the company generally selects investment assets with characteristics such as duration  yield  currency and liquidity that correspond to the underlying characteristics of its related insurance and contractholder liabilities so that the company can match the investments to its obligations 
shorter term investments support generally shorter term life and health liabilities 
medium term  fixed rate investments support interest sensitive and health liabilities 
longer term investments generally support products with longer pay out periods such as annuities and long term disability liabilities 
use of local currencies for foreign operations 
the company generally conducts its international business through foreign operating entities that maintain assets and liabilities in local currencies 
while this technique does not reduce the company s foreign currency exposure of its net assets  it substantially limits exchange rate risk to those net assets 
use of derivatives 
the company generally uses derivative financial instruments to minimize certain market risks 
see notes c and to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about financial instruments  including derivative financial instruments 
effect of market fluctuations on the company the examples that follow illustrate the effect of hypothetical changes in market rates or prices on the fair value of certain financial instruments including hypothetical changes in market interest rates  primarily for fixed maturities and commercial mortgage loans  partially offset by liabilities for long term debt and gmib contracts  hypothetical changes in market rates for foreign currencies  primarily for the net assets of foreign subsidiaries denominated in a foreign currency  and hypothetical changes in market prices for equity exposures  primarily for equity securities and gmib contracts 
in addition  hypothetical effects of changes in equity indices and foreign exchange rates are presented separately for futures contracts used in the gmdb equity hedge program 
cigna corporation form k 
back to contents management believes that actual results could differ materially from these examples because these examples were developed using estimates and assumptions  changes in the fair values of all insurance related assets and liabilities have been excluded because their primary risks are insurance rather than market risk  changes in the fair values of investments recorded using the equity method of accounting and liabilities for pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit plans and related assets have been excluded  consistent with the disclosure guidance  and changes in the fair values of other significant assets and liabilities such as goodwill  deferred policy acquisition costs  taxes  and various accrued liabilities have been excluded  because they are not financial instruments  their primary risks are other than market risk 
the effects of hypothetical changes in market rates or prices on the fair values of certain of the company s financial instruments  subject to the exclusions noted above particularly insurance liabilities  would have been as follows as of december market scenario for certain non insurance financial instruments in millions loss in fair value basis point increase in interest rates strengthening in us dollar to foreign currencies decrease in market prices for equity exposures the company s foreign operations hold investment assets  such as fixed maturities  that are generally invested in the currency of the related liabilities 
due to the increase in the fair value of these investments in  which are primarily denominated in the south korean won  the effect of a hypothetical strengthening in us dollar to foreign currencies at december  was greater than that effect at december  the effect of a hypothetical increase in interest rates was determined by estimating the present value of future cash flows using various models  primarily duration modeling and  for gmib contracts  stochastic modeling 
the effect of a hypothetical strengthening of the us dollar relative to the foreign currencies held by the company was estimated to be of the us dollar equivalent fair value 
the effect of a hypothetical decrease in the market prices of equity exposures was estimated based on a decrease in the equity mutual fund values underlying guaranteed minimum income benefits reinsured by the company and a decrease in the value of equity securities held by the company 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
the company uses futures contracts as part of a gmdb equity hedge program to substantially reduce the effect of equity market changes on certain reinsurance contracts that guarantee minimum death benefits based on unfavorable changes in underlying variable annuity account values 
the hypothetical effect of a increase in the s p  s p  russell  nasdaq  topix japanese  eurostoxx and ftse british equity indices and a weakening in the us dollar to the japanese yen  british pound and euro would have been a decrease of approximately million in the fair value of the futures contracts outstanding under this program as of december  a corresponding decrease in liabilities for gmdb contracts would result from the hypothetical increase in these equity indices and weakening in the us dollar 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this program and related gmdb contracts 
as noted above  the company manages its exposures to market risk by matching investment characteristics to its obligations 
stock market performance the performance of equity markets can have a significant effect on the company s businesses  including on risks and exposures associated with gmdb see note to the consolidated financial statements and gmib contracts see note to the consolidated financial statements  and pension liabilities since equity securities comprise a significant portion of the assets of the company s employee pension plans
