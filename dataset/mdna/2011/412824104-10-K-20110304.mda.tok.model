table of contents overview the company s net income is primarily determined by four elements net premium income  investment income and realized investment gains losses  amounts paid or reserved to settle insured claims  and other income and expense 
variations in premium income are subject to a number of factors  including limitations on premium rates arising from the competitive marketplace or regulation  limitations on available business arising from a need to maintain the quality of underwritten risks  the company s ability to maintain it s a excellent group rating by am best  and the ability of the company to maintain a reputation for efficiency and fairness in claims administration 
variations in investment income and realized investment gains losses are subject to a number of factors  including general interest rate levels and financial market conditions  specific adverse events affecting the issuers of debt obligations held by the company  and changes in the prices of debt and equity securities generally and those held by the company specifically 
loss and loss settlement expenses are affected by a number of factors  including the quality of the risks underwritten by the company  the nature and severity of catastrophic losses  the availability  cost and terms of reinsurance  and underlying settlement costs  including medical and legal costs 
variations in other income and expense are affected by a number of factors  including the level of premiums written by the mutual company and its subsidiaries which are subject to the management fee  the amount of flood insurance written and ceded to the national flood insurance program  and the interest rate on debt issued by the company 
the company seeks to manage each of the foregoing to the extent within its control 
many of the foregoing factors are partially  or entirely  outside of the control of the company 
critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require harleysville group to make estimates and assumptions see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
harleysville group believes that of its significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and estimation 
the judgments  or the methodology on which the judgments are made  are reviewed quarterly with the audit committee 
liabilities for losses and loss settlement expenses 
the liability for losses and loss settlement expenses represents estimates of the ultimate unpaid cost of all losses incurred  including losses for claims which have not yet been reported to harleysville group 
the amount of loss reserves for reported claims is based primarily upon a case 
table of contents by case evaluation of the type of risk involved  knowledge of the circumstances surrounding each claim and the insurance policy provisions relating to the type of loss 
the amounts of loss reserves for unreported claims and loss settlement expense reserves are determined utilizing historical information by line of insurance as adjusted to current conditions 
inflation is implicitly provided for in the reserving function through analysis of costs  trends and reviews of historical reserving results 
estimates of the liabilities are reviewed and updated on a regular basis using the most recent information on reported claims and a variety of actuarial techniques 
it is expected that such estimates will be more or less than the amounts ultimately paid when the claims are settled 
changes in these estimates are reflected in current operations 
investments 
generally  unrealized investment gains or losses on investments carried at fair value  net of applicable income taxes  are reflected directly in shareholders equity as a component of comprehensive income and  accordingly  have no effect on net income 
however  if the fair value of an investment in equity securities declines below its cost and that decline is deemed other than temporary  the amount of the decline below cost is charged to earnings 
per the company s current policy  a fixed maturity security is other than temporarily impaired if the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost of the security or where the security s fair value is below cost and the company intends to sell  or more likely than not will be required to sell  the security before recovery of its value 
if the company does not intend to sell  or more likely than not will not be required to sell  a fixed maturity security whose fair value has declined below its cost  the amount of the decline below cost due to credit related reasons is charged to earnings and the remaining difference is included in comprehensive income 
harleysville group monitors its investment portfolio and at least quarterly reviews investments that have experienced a decline in fair value below cost to evaluate whether the decline is other than temporary 
such evaluations consider  among other things  the magnitude and reasons for a decline  the prospects for the fair value to recover in the near term and harleysville group s intent to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery in value 
future adverse investment market conditions  or poor operating results of underlying investments  could result in an impairment charge in the future 
the severe downturn in the public debt and equity markets in recent years  reflecting uncertainties associated with the mortgage crisis  worsening economic conditions  widening of credit spreads  bankruptcies and government intervention in large financial institutions  has resulted in significant realized and unrealized losses in our investment portfolio in the past 
depending on market conditions going forward  we could incur additional realized and unrealized losses in future periods 
the fair value of equity securities is based on the closing market value 
the fair value of mutual fund holdings is based on the closing net asset value reported by the fund 
the fair value of fixed maturities is based upon data supplied by an independent pricing service 
it can be difficult to determine the fair value of non traded securities  but harleysville group does not own a material amount of non traded securities 
policy acquisition costs 
policy acquisition costs  such as commissions  premium taxes and certain other underwriting and agency expenses that vary with and are primarily related to the production of business  are deferred and amortized over the effective period of the related insurance policies and in proportion to the premiums earned 
the method followed in computing deferred policy acquisition costs limits the amount of such deferred costs to their estimated realizable value 
the estimation of net realizable value takes into account the premium to be earned  related investment income over the claim paying period  expected losses and loss settlement expenses  and certain other costs expected to be incurred as the premium is earned 
future changes in estimates  the most significant of which is expected losses and loss settlement expenses  may require adjustments to deferred policy acquisition costs 
if the estimation of net realizable value indicates that the deferred acquisition costs are not recoverable  they would be written off and further analyses would be performed to determine if an additional liability would need to be accrued 
contingencies 
besides claims related to its insurance products  harleysville group is subject to proceedings  lawsuits and claims in the normal course of business 
harleysville group assesses the likelihood of any adverse outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
there can be no assurance that actual outcomes will be consistent with those assessments 
the application of certain of these critical accounting policies to the years ended december  and is discussed in greater detail below 

table of contents results of operations harleysville group underwrites property and casualty insurance in both the personal and commercial lines of insurance 
the personal lines of insurance include both auto and homeowners  and the commercial lines include auto  commercial multi peril and workers compensation 
the business is marketed primarily in the eastern and midwestern united states through independent agents 
historically  harleysville group s results of operations have been influenced by factors affecting the property and casualty insurance industry in general 
the operating results of the united states property and casualty insurance industry have been subject to significant variations due to competition  weather  catastrophic events  regulation  the availability and cost of satisfactory reinsurance  general economic conditions  judicial trends  fluctuations in interest rates and other changes in the investment environment 
harleysville group s premium growth and underwriting results have been  and continue to be  influenced by market conditions 
insurance industry price competition has often made it difficult both to obtain and to retain properly priced personal and commercial lines business 
it is management s policy to continue to maintain its underwriting standards 
property and casualty insurance premiums are established before the amount of losses and loss settlement expenses  or the extent to which inflation may affect such expenses  are known 
consequently  harleysville group attempts  in establishing rates  to anticipate the potential impact of inflation 
in the past  inflation has contributed to increased losses and loss settlement expenses 
the key elements of harleysville group s business model are the sales of properly priced and underwritten personal and commercial property and casualty insurance through independent agents and the investment of the premiums in a manner designed to assure that claims and expenses can be paid while providing a return on the capital employed 
loss trends and investment performance are critical factors in influencing the success of the business model 
these factors are affected by the factors impacting the insurance industry in general as described above and factors unique to harleysville group as described in the following discussion 
transactions with affiliates the company s property and casualty subsidiaries participate in a pooling agreement with harleysville mutual insurance company the mutual company and its property and casualty insurance subsidiary  harleysville pennland insurance company pennland 
the pooling agreement provides for the allocation of premiums  losses  loss settlement expenses and underwriting expenses between harleysville group and the mutual company 
harleysville group is not liable for any losses incurred by the mutual company or company subsidiaries harleysville preferred insurance company preferred and harleysville insurance company of new jersey hnj prior to january   the date the pooling agreement became effective  or for certain business assumed by the mutual company effective january  harleysville group s participation in the pool has been since january  effective january   the company s property and casualty subsidiaries and the mutual company and pennland amended their intercompany pooling agreement as it relates to their workers compensation business 
the amendment establishes that the financial results associated with the workers compensation business for accident years and following will be retained percent by the mutual company 
the financial results of this business for prior accident years will continue to be shared between the company s property and casualty subsidiaries  the mutual company and pennland under the existing pool participations 
harleysville group paid cash of million on january  associated with the transfer of the unearned premium liability on the workers compensation business as of january  harleysville group s unearned premium liability decreased by million and harleysville group received a ceding commission of million for expenses that were incurred to generate the business ceded to the mutual company  which ceding commission reduced deferred policy acquisition costs 
effective january   the pooling agreement was amended to exclude premiums  losses  loss settlement expenses and underwriting expenses voluntarily assumed by the mutual company 
effective january   the company s property and casualty subsidiaries and the mutual company and pennland amended their intercompany pooling agreement to increase harleysville group s share of the pool from to 
harleysville group received cash and investments of million on january  associated with the transfer of liabilities from the mutual company to harleysville group in connection with the pool change 
harleysville group s liabilities increased million and harleysville group reimbursed the mutual company million  through a ceding commission  for expenses that were incurred to generate the additional business assumed by the company s property and casualty subsidiaries  which ceding commission was deferred as policy acquisition costs 

table of contents these liabilities consisted of the following at january  in thousands unpaid losses and loss settlement expenses net of reinsurance unearned premiums net of reinsurance other liabilities less ceding commission paid when the company s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries pooling participation increases  there is a larger retrocession of this pooled business from the mutual company 
through this retrocession  harleysville group is assuming a larger share of premiums  losses and underwriting expenses for current and future periods originating both from its subsidiaries and the mutual company 
an increase in harleysville group s pooling participation results in a larger share of the pooled liabilities being assumed by harleysville group 
cash and investments are received by harleysville group equal to this greater share of loss reserves  unearned premiums and other insurance liabilities primarily commissions and premium taxes less a ceding commission based on acquisition costs related to unearned premiums 
an increase in pool participation also increases harleysville group s leverage and exposure to prior period development 
because the pooling agreement does not relieve harleysville group of primary liability as the originating insurer  there is a concentration of credit risk arising from business ceded to the mutual company 
however  the pooling agreement provides for the right of offset and the amount of credit risk with the mutual company was not material at december  and the mutual company has an a

harleysville group recognizes any associated bad debts  which have not been material 
compared to premiums earned increased million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase of million in premiums earned for personal lines  partially offset by a decrease of million in premiums earned for commercial lines 
the increase in premiums earned for personal lines was  primarily due to new business writings and higher average premiums 
the decrease in premiums earned for commercial lines was  primarily due to lower average premiums  lower exposures and a decline in assumed premiums earned from involuntary pools 
investment income decreased million for the year ended december   primarily due to a lower investment yield on fixed income securities and short term investments and a greater percentage of fixed income securities invested in tax exempt securities 
during the second half of  harleysville group purchased an additional million of equity securities in order to generate additional investment income 
investments were made in high quality  large cap companies with strong balance sheets and a history of paying and increasing their dividends

harleysville group holds securities with unrealized losses at december  as follows length of unrealized loss fair value unrealized loss less than months in thousands fixed maturities us treasury securities obligations of states and political subdivisions corporate securities total fixed maturities equity securities total temporarily impaired securities all of the fixed maturity securities with an unrealized loss at december   are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value on the balance sheet 

table of contents the unrealized losses on fixed maturity investments were primarily due to an increase in interest rates rather than a decline in credit quality 
per the company s policy  a fixed maturity security is other than temporarily impaired if the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost of the security or where the security s fair value is below cost and the company intends to sell or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its value 
the company believes  based on its analysis  that these securities are not other than temporarily impaired 
however  depending on developments involving both the issuers and worsening economic conditions  these investments may be written down in the income statement in the future 
twelve positions comprise the unrealized loss in equity investments at december  these securities have not been below cost for significant continuous amounts of time 
harleysville group is monitoring these securities and some could possibly be written down in the income statement in the future 
income before income taxes decreased million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
the decrease was primarily due to an underwriting loss in compared to an underwriting gain in and a decrease in investment income 
an insurance company s statutory combined ratio is a standard measure of underwriting profitability 
this ratio is the sum of the ratio of incurred losses and loss settlement expenses to net earned premium  the ratio of expenses incurred for commissions  premium taxes  administrative and other underwriting expenses to net written premium  and the ratio of dividends to policyholders to net earned premium 
the combined ratio does not reflect investment income  federal income taxes or other non operating income or expense 
a ratio of less than percent generally indicates underwriting profitability 
harleysville group s statutory combined ratio increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase in the combined ratio was primarily due to greater catastrophe losses and greater non catastrophe property losses in  partially offset by greater favorable development in net catastrophe losses increased to million points for from million points for the catastrophe losses were primarily due to a series of severe winter storms in the first quarter and several wind and hail events during the second and third quarters 
the statutory combined ratios by line of business for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  are shown below 
for the year ended december  commercial automobile workers compensation commercial multi peril other commercial total commercial personal automobile homeowners other personal total personal total personal and commercial the commercial lines statutory combined ratio increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to the commercial automobile line of business for which the statutory combined ratio increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase in the commercial automobile combined ratio is primarily due to the recognition of points of favorable development from prior accident years in  compared to the recognition of points of favorable development from prior accident years in the commercial multi peril line of business also contributed to the increase in the commercial lines statutory combined ratio in the year 
the commercial multi peril statutory combined ratio increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december   primarily due to a higher level of property losses compared to the prior year 

table of contents the personal lines statutory combined ratio increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase in the personal lines combined ratio for the year ended december  primarily relates to a higher incidence of personal lines catastrophe losses during points compared to the catastrophe losses in points 
catastrophe losses in the homeowners line of business were significantly higher during points compared to points 
reserves for unpaid losses and loss settlement expenses are estimated for case reserves and losses incurred but not reported ibnr separately 
the sum of case reserves and ibnr represents the company s estimate of total unpaid loss and loss settlement expense 
case reserves are determined for each reported claim by the company s claims organization reflecting the known circumstances of the individual claim 
the company s actuaries calculate ibnr by reducing their estimate of ultimate loss and loss settlement expense by cumulative paid loss and loss settlement expense and case reserves 
ultimate losses are re estimated for each line of business on a quarterly basis using the most current loss and claim data as of the quarter end 
in addition to analyzing reserves on a line of business basis  reserving categories are identified and reviewed 
for example  the following categories for the commercial auto liability line of business are analyzed quarterly commercial auto liability bodily injury  commercial auto liability property damage  and commercial auto liability excess 
in the discussion that follows  these categories are referred to by the label line of business 
in the course of our quarterly reserve estimation process  several standard loss reserving methods and procedures are utilized to derive estimates of ultimate loss for each line of business  including paid loss development method incurred loss development method incurred counts and averages method based on exponential fit of severity bornhuetter ferguson method any individual method used to estimate loss reserves has its advantages and disadvantages based on trends  changes within the external business environment  changes in internal company processes and procedures and any bias that may be inherent in the methodology 
the actuaries give consideration to the relative strengths and weaknesses of each of the methods to derive a selected point estimate within the range 
following is a general description of each of the methods used paid loss development method the paid loss development method uses historical payment patterns to project future payments as of a given evaluation date to ultimate loss 
estimates using this method are not affected by changes in case reserving practices that might have occurred during the review period  but may be understated as this method does not take into account large unpaid claims 
this method is also susceptible to any changes in the rate of claim settlements or shifts in the size of claims settled 
a number of indications of ultimate loss may be produced from the paid loss development method since a number of loss development factors ldfs may be selected 
the actuaries produce and review several indications of ultimate loss using this method based on various ldf selections as judged appropriate  such as year average straight average and loss weighted average year average straight average and loss weighted average year excluding highest and lowest ldfs all year loss weighted average selected ldf pattern ldfs are selected for each evaluation based on the actuaries review of the historical development incurred loss development method the incurred loss development method is similar to the paid method  but instead uses historical incurred case reserves plus payments patterns to project future incurred losses as of a given evaluation date to ultimate loss 
in many cases  the incurred development method is preferred over the paid method as it includes the additional information provided by the 
table of contents aggregation of individual case reserves 
the resulting ldfs tend to be lower and more stable than those of the paid development method 
however  the incurred development method may be affected by changes in case reserving practices and any unusually large individual claims 
as with the paid loss development method  various indications of ultimate loss may be produced from the incurred loss development method 
the actuaries produce and review several indications of ultimate loss using this method based on various ldf selections 
incurred counts and averages method this method is used to estimate ultimate loss by separately estimating ultimate counts and severity average loss per claim components of ultimate loss 
both the ultimate claim counts and ultimate severity are estimated using a loss development factor approach similar to the incurred loss development method 
for this reason  the same considerations discussed in the incurred loss development method apply to this method as well 
an ultimate severity is selected by fitting a curve to the historical ultimate severities indicated using the ratio of the ultimate loss and ultimate claim counts 
this method yields ultimate severities that are based on the underlying historical trends in the data 
ultimate claim counts and ultimate severities are multiplied together to produce an estimate of ultimate losses 
this method is useful in more recent accident years where the data is not mature and is especially useful when loss development patterns are volatile or not well established 
bornhuetter ferguson method the bornhuetter ferguson method is a blended method that explicitly takes into account both actual loss development to date and expected future loss emergence 
two versions of this method may be used one based on paid loss and one based on incurred loss 
this method uses the selected loss development patterns from the development methods to calculate the expected percentage of loss unpaid or unreported 
the expected component of the method is calculated by multiplying earned premium for the given exposure period by a selected a priori loss ratio 
the resulting dollars are then multiplied by the expected percentage of unpaid or unreported loss described above 
this provides an estimate of future loss payments or reporting that is then added to actual paid or incurred loss data to produce estimated ultimate loss 
each of the methodologies described above and their derivatives are reviewed for each line of business 
this approach allows the actuaries to identify and respond to the unique characteristics of each line of business 
further  since long term historical data is reviewed  changes in development patterns within a line of business may likewise be identified and considered in the actuaries process of selecting ultimate loss 
an actuarial central estimate  which is management s best estimate  of ultimate loss is selected for each line of business based on a review of the indications produced by the above methodologies 
more consideration is given to those methods that the actuaries deem to be more appropriate in a particular situation 
in addition  other metrics such as claim closing ratios  average case reserve levels  paid loss to incurred loss ratios  individual large loss information  and recent insurance pricing changes are reviewed to help the actuaries select the most appropriate estimates of ultimate loss 
the selection of the ultimate loss is based on information unique to each line of business and accident year and the judgment and expertise of the actuaries 
short tail versus long tail lines of business the reserving methods described above are generally applied to each line of business  regardless of their classification as short tail or long tail 
tail refers to the time period between the occurrence of a loss and the final settlement of the claim 
the merits of an individual reserving method relative to the line of business and age of accident period are considered in the actuaries process of selecting ultimate loss 
short tail lines of business  by definition  develop to their ultimate value faster than long tail lines of business 
property coverages including inland marine along with automobile physical damage coverages are considered short tail lines of business 
automobile liability  general liability  commercial multi peril liability and workers compensation are considered long tail lines of business 
for many liability claims  significant periods of time may elapse between the occurrence of the loss  the reporting of the loss  and the final settlement of the claim 
workers compensation claims can result in providing medical benefits and wage replacement over the course of an injured worker s lifetime 

table of contents in general  more consideration may be given to the results of the development methodologies for short tail lines than to long tail lines for accident periods of the same maturity 
for example  the indicated ultimate loss using the incurred loss development method for the most recent accident year is generally considered more reliable for a short tail line  such as homeowners property  than a long tail line  such as workers compensation 
as mentioned previously  the selection of ultimate loss is based on information unique to each line of business and accident year subject to exceptions  such as the emergence of one or more unusually large claims in a particular accident period for a short tail line 
in this case  the indications produced by the development methods may be overstated due to development of ultimate losses to amounts in excess of policy limits and such information would be considered in the actuaries process of selecting ultimate loss 
immature accident periods the paid loss development method is generally given less consideration than the incurred loss development method for less mature accident periods since the relatively low magnitude of losses paid at early evaluations tends to result in less reliable indications from the paid loss development method 
for long tail lines of business  neither the incurred nor the paid loss development methods may receive significant consideration for the most recent accident period 
this is due to the fact that the relatively low magnitude of losses either incurred or paid at early evaluations tends to result in less reliable indications from these methods 
in faster developing  short tailed lines such as auto physical damage  special property  homeowners  commercial multi peril property and property damage  the paid loss development method  the incurred loss development method and the bornhuetter ferguson methods are primarily used as they typically produce tightly clustered projections for all accident years 
the estimation of loss reserves for long tail lines such as commercial auto liability  commercial multi peril liability  and workers compensation is more complex and is subject to a higher degree of variability than for short tail lines of business

the tables below break out the change in the estimate of ultimate losses between december  and december  for the   and accident years into severity and frequency components for the major commercial and personal lines of business 
table summarizes the company s percentage change in the estimate of ultimate loss and loss settlement expense by line of business between december  and december  tables and summarize the company s percentage change in the estimate of ultimate severity and ultimate claim counts  respectively 
the relationship between the three tables is as follows the change in estimated ultimate loss the change in estimated ultimate severity x the change in estimated ultimate claim counts 
the estimated ultimate severity is calculated as the ratio of estimated ultimate loss to estimated ultimate claim counts 
the amounts underlying these tables are based on direct loss and claim experience minus ceded loss experience and exclude a small portion of losses associated with business assumed from involuntary pools

table of contents table percentage increase decrease in ultimate claim counts between the years ended december  and december  accident years line of business commercial automobile workers compensation commercial multi peril other commercial total commercial personal automobile homeowners other personal total personal total all lines these tables illustrate that the changes to the company s estimates of ultimate loss for prior accident years between december  and december  are primarily driven by the severity component of loss 
in this context  the term severity does not refer to an actuarial assumption  rather  it refers to severity as a descriptive statistic derived from the ratio of estimated ultimate loss to estimated ultimate claim counts 
in general  as estimates of the ultimate number of claims were relatively stable for the prior accident periods  the changes in estimates of ultimate loss are characterized as resulting from a reduction in severity 
in general  those lines of business with a relatively low underlying volume of data  such as other commercial lines and other personal lines  are subject to greater variability in both claim severity and claim count development 
the following table presents workers compensation claim count information for the total pooled business in which harleysville group participates and payment amounts which are harleysville group s pooling share of the total pooled amounts for the year ended december  dollars in thousands number of claims pending  beginning of period number of claims reported number of claims settled or dismissed number of claims pending  end of period losses paid loss settlement expenses paid workers compensation losses primarily consist of indemnity and medical costs for injured workers 

table of contents harleysville group records the actuarial central estimate  which is management s best estimate  of the ultimate unpaid losses and loss settlement expenses incurred 
the estimate represents the actuarially determined expected amount of future payments on all loss and loss settlement expenses incurred on or before december  actuarial loss reserving techniques and assumptions  which rely on historical information as adjusted to reflect current conditions  have been consistently applied  after including consideration of recent case reserve activity  during the periods presented 
changes in the estimate of the liability for unpaid losses and loss settlement expenses reflect actual payments and evaluations of new information and data since the last reporting date 
these changes correlate with actuarial trends 
the following table presents the liability for unpaid losses and loss settlement expenses by case and incurred but not reported ibnr reserves by line of business and a statistically determined range of estimates of the ultimate unpaid losses and loss settlement expenses incurred for each line of business as of december  the range of estimates around the actuarial central estimates is statistically determined in order to provide information regarding the variability of the actuarial central estimates 
the statistical analysis is completed only on a basis that is net of reinsurance recoverables  as this appropriately reflects harleysville group s risk profile based on the type and quality of its reinsurance 
the range is determined using the monte carlo simulation method 
this method uses the company s actual historical loss data to estimate the mean and standard deviation of a statistical distribution for future loss development 
there have been no adjustments made to the historical data 
the company s application of the monte carlo simulation assumes that loss development factors are normally distributed with a mean and standard deviation derived from the historical data 
reserve ranges are determined using both paid and incurred loss development data with a  trial simulation run against each set of data for each line of business presented in the table below 
each simulation generates a unique set of loss development factors randomly generated from the normal distribution with mean and standard deviation as defined above 
each unique set of loss development factors  when applied to the data  produces a unique reserve estimate 
at the completion of the simulation  there are  unique reserve estimates which can be ordered from lowest to highest creating a range of reserve estimates 
the resulting range produced by the simulation is used to create a reasonable representation of a confidence interval using the point as the low end of the range and the point as the high end of the range 
the confidence interval represents the range of reserve estimates for which there is approximately a probability that the actual reserve amount which will not be known for many years is contained within the defined range 
the total commercial lines range and total personal lines range were developed as separate simulations using the means and standard deviations of the individual lines as inputs 
therefore  the confidence interval for all lines of business is smaller than the straight sum of the individual lines of business intervals 
the use of this technique to analyze reserve ranges assumes historical data has validity in predicting future outcomes 
this assumption is consistent with a key assumption underlying much of insurance pricing and reserving theory

of these amounts  million and million  respectively  or and  respectively  of the receivables were due from governmental bodies  regulatory agencies or quasi governmental pools and reinsurance facilities where  harleysville group believes  there is limited credit risk 
the remainder of the reinsurance recoverables are principally due from reinsurers rated a or higher by the am best company 
ceded reinsurance contracts do not relieve harleysville group s primary obligation to its policyholders 
consequently  an exposure exists with respect to reinsurance recoverables to the extent that any reinsurer is unable to meet its obligation or disputes the liabilities assumed under the reinsurance contract 
from time to time  harleysville group may encounter such disputes with its reinsurers 
in addition  the creditworthiness of our reinsurers could deteriorate in the future due to adverse events affecting the reinsurance industry  such as a large number of major catastrophes 
because of the nature of insurance claims  there are uncertainties inherent in the estimates of ultimate losses 
harleysville group s reorganization of its claims operation in recent years has resulted in new people and processes involved in settling claims 
as a result  more recent statistical data reflects different patterns than in the past and gives rise to uncertainty as to the pattern of future loss settlements 
there are uncertainties regarding future loss cost trends particularly related to medical treatments and automobile repair 
court decisions  regulatory changes and economic conditions can affect the ultimate cost of claims that occurred in the past 
accordingly  the ultimate liability for unpaid losses and loss settlement expenses will likely differ from the amount recorded at december  the property and casualty industry has had substantial aggregate loss experience from claims related to asbestos related illnesses  environmental remediation  product liability  mold  and other uncertain exposures 
harleysville group has not experienced significant losses from such claims 

table of contents other income increased million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in fee income received in connection with the national flood insurance program and an increase in management fees received from the mutual company 
the management fees received from the mutual company are expected to increase in  as the mutual company has entered into additional assumed reinsurance agreements in which are subject to the management fee 
the income tax expense for the year ended december  includes the tax benefit of million associated with tax exempt income compared to million in the prior year 
compared to premiums earned decreased million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the prior year primarily due to a decrease of million in premiums earned for commercial lines  partially offset by an increase of million in premiums earned for personal lines 
the decrease in premiums earned for commercial lines was  primarily due to lower average premiums and lower exposures 
the increase in premiums earned for personal lines was  with increases in premiums earned in homeowners  personal automobile and other personal lines primarily due to an increase in new business writings and higher average premiums 
investment income decreased million for the year ended december   primarily due to a lower average level of fixed income securities  a lower investment yield on fixed income securities and short term investments and a greater percentage of fixed income securities invested in tax exempt securities 
the lower average level of fixed income securities was primarily due to the use of the proceeds from sales of these investments to repurchase shares under the company s stock repurchase programs in and net realized investment gains losses increased million for the year ended december   primarily due to a decrease in impairment charges in there were credit related impairment charges of million on non equity securities in and million in the impairment charges consisted of million on bonds the company intends to sell the bonds were sold at a slight gain in and million on structured investment vehicles 
the impairment charges consisted of million on lehman brothers bonds and million on structured investment vehicles 
in the third quarter of  the company recorded an impairment charge of million on equity securities that it was planning to sell 
there was an additional impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of on the equity securities  prior to their sale 
the equity securities were sold in november to recover a portion of federal income taxes which were previously paid 
in  the company sold all of its holdings of individual equity securities and invested in equity index funds 
as a result of this transaction  the company recognized a capital gain of approximately million 
under existing federal income tax regulations  such taxes can be recovered in future periods to the extent capital losses are recognized 
as a result of the decline in value of the equity index funds held by the company during  the duration of the impairment  the likelihood of near term recovery and the availability to carryback realized capital losses for federal income tax purposes upon their disposal  the company determined that it was appropriate to sell the equity investments and recover a portion of the federal income taxes which were previously paid 
income before income taxes increased million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to the change in realized investment gains losses and underwriting gains in compared to underwriting losses in  partially offset by the decrease in investment income 
harleysville group s statutory combined ratio decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the statutory combined ratio for includes a benefit of due to the impact of the transfer of liabilities in connection with the pool change 
this benefit results from the statutory treatment of the ceding commission paid on the unearned premiums transferred on january  
table of contents excluding the impact of the pool transfer  the statutory combined ratio decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decrease in the combined ratio was primarily due to lower catastrophe losses in  partially offset by greater non catastrophe property losses 
net catastrophe losses decreased to million points for from million points for the catastrophe losses were primarily due to tornadoes and hail storms impacting arkansas and minnesota during the second quarter 
the statutory combined ratios by line of business for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  are shown below

although the commercial lines statutory combined ratio for the year ended december  was similar to that of the prior year  more significant changes were noted by line of business  particularly for the workers compensation and other commercial lines 
the workers compensation statutory combined ratio decreased for the year ended december   primarily due to the recognition of points of favorable development from prior accident years in  compared to the recognition of points of favorable development from prior accident years in the other commercial statutory combined ratios increased for the year ended december   primarily due to a higher level of non cat property losses compared to one year prior 
the personal lines statutory combined ratio decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  excluding the impact of the pool transfer 
the decrease in the personal lines combined ratio for the year ended december  primarily relates to the lower incidence of personal lines catastrophe losses during points compared to the catastrophe losses in points 
the favorable impact of lower catastrophe experience in was partially offset by a lower amount of favorable prior year development in the personal auto line in points compared to points

new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued guidance which replaces the quantitative based risks and rewards calculation for determining whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary in a variable interest entity with an approach that is primarily qualitative  and requires ongoing assessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity 
the guidance  which is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   also requires additional disclosures about an enterprise s involvement in variable interest entities 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial position 
in january  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu  fair value measurements and disclosures 
asu applies to all entities that are required to make disclosures about recurring or non recurring fair value measurements 
asu provides guidance on additional disclosures on any significant transfers in and out of level and level and a description of the transfer

liquidity and capital resources liquidity is a measure of the ability to generate sufficient cash to meet cash obligations as they come due 
harleysville group s primary sources of cash are premium income  investment income and maturing investments 
cash outflows can be variable because of uncertainties regarding settlement dates for liabilities for unpaid losses and because of the potential for large losses  either individually or in the aggregate 
accordingly  harleysville group maintains investment and reinsurance programs generally intended to provide adequate funds to pay claims without forced sales of investments 
harleysville group models its exposure to catastrophes and has the ability to pay claims without selling held to maturity securities even for events having a low less than probability 
even in years of greater catastrophe frequency  harleysville group generally has been able to pay claims without liquidating any investments 
harleysville group has also considered scenarios of declines in revenue and increases in loss payments  and believes it has the ability to meet cash requirements under such scenarios without selling held to maturity securities 
harleysville group s policy with respect to fixed maturity investments is to purchase only those that are of investment grade quality 
net cash provided by operating activities was million and million for and  respectively 
the decrease of million is primarily due to a decrease in underwriting cash flow  a decrease in investment income  and an increase in federal income tax payments 
net cash used by investing activities was million and million for and  respectively 
the decrease is primarily due to lower net purchases of investments due to the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities and the increase in cash used by financing activities 
financing activities used net cash of million and million for and  respectively 
the increase is primarily due to an increase in dividends paid in harleysville group s investment strategy is designed to complement and support the insurance operations 
harleysville group considers projected cash flow premiums  investment income  reinsurance programs  liability payout patterns  general expenses  large seasonal obligations  intercompany transfers  etc 
to assure that sufficient liquidity exists within harleysville group and the mutual company 
maintaining a regular maturity schedule in readily marketable securities is an essential part of addressing liquidity 
this regular maturity schedule is maintained in all interest rate environments 
after tax yield will be maximized consistent with safety and liquidity considerations by investment in taxable or tax exempt securities  depending on harleysville group s tax position 
the company had million of cash and marketable securities at december   which are available for general corporate purposes including dividends  debt service  capital contributions to subsidiaries  acquisitions and the repurchase of stock 
on february   the board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to  shares of its outstanding common stock over a two year period in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
additionally  the board authorized the company to make purchases under the terms of a rule b trading plan  which allows the company to purchase its shares at times when it ordinarily would not be in the market because of self imposed trading blackout periods  such as the time preceding its quarterly earnings releases or because its officers are in possession of material  non public information 
the company repurchased shares in open market transactions from the public float  and did not repurchase shares from the mutual company 
this program was completed on june  on july   the board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional  shares of its outstanding common stock over a two year period under terms similar to the repurchase authorization of february  the company repurchased shares in open market transactions from the public float  and did not repurchase shares from the mutual company

also  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the national association of insurance commissioners naic adopted risk based capital rbc standards that require insurance companies to calculate and report statutory capital and surplus needs based on a formula measuring underwriting  investment and other business risks inherent in an individual company s operations 
these rbc standards have not affected the operations of harleysville group since each of the company s insurance subsidiaries has statutory capital and surplus in excess of rbc requirements 
these rbc standards require the calculation of a ratio of total adjusted capital to authorized control level 
insurers with a ratio below are subject to different levels of regulatory intervention and action 
based upon their statutory financial statements  the ratio of total adjusted capital to the authorized control level for the company s eight insurance subsidiaries at december  ranged from to 
the following summarizes harleysville group s contractual obligations at december  total less than year years years more than years in thousands contractual obligations debt interest on debt gross liability for unpaid losses and loss settlement expenses total the table above does not include capital lease obligations  operating lease obligations or purchase obligations as they are either not applicable or not material 
the timing of the amounts for the gross liability for unpaid losses and loss settlement expenses is an estimate based on historical experience and expectations of future payment patterns 
however  the timing of these payments may vary significantly from the amounts stated above 
risk factors you should consider carefully the following risks  as well as the other information contained in this annual report on form k 
if any of the following events described in the risk factors below actually occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
you should refer to the other information set forth in this annual report on form k including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
risks related to the property and casualty insurance industry generally if our estimated liability for losses and loss settlement expenses is incorrect  our reserves may not be adequate to cover our ultimate liability for losses and loss settlement expenses and may have to be increased 
we are required to maintain loss reserves for our estimated liability for losses and loss settlement expenses associated with reported and unreported claims for each accounting period 
we regularly review our reserving techniques and our overall amount of reserves and  based on our estimated liability  raise or lower the levels of our 
table of contents reserves accordingly 
if our estimates are incorrect and our reserves are inadequate  we are obligated to increase our reserves 
an increase in reserves results in an increase in losses and a reduction in our net income for the period in which the deficiency in reserves is identified 
accordingly  an increase in reserves could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
our reserve amounts are estimated based on what we expect our ultimate liability for losses and loss settlement expenses to be 
these estimates are based on facts and circumstances of which we are aware  predictions of future events  trends in claims severity and frequency and other subjective factors 
although we use a number of actuarial methods to project our ultimate liability  there is no method that can always exactly predict our ultimate liability for losses and loss settlement expenses 
in addition to reviewing our reserving techniques  as part of our reserving process we also consider information regarding each claim for losses  our loss history and the industry s loss history  legislative enactments  judicial decisions and legal developments regarding damages  changes in political attitudes  and trends in general economic conditions  including inflation 
if certain catastrophic events occur  including increased claims related to changing climate conditions  they could have a significant impact on our operating results and financial condition 
results of property insurers are subject to weather and other events prevailing in any given year 
while one year may be relatively free of major weather or other disasters  another year may have numerous such events causing results for that year to be materially worse than for other years 
our insurance subsidiaries have experienced  and are expected in the future to experience  catastrophe losses 
it is possible that a catastrophic event or a series of multiple catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on the operating results and financial condition of our insurance subsidiaries  thereby limiting the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us 
in the last years  the largest non flood catastrophe to affect our results of operations was hurricane floyd in the third quarter of  which resulted in million of losses 
in  we experienced losses totaling million from thirty two different catastrophes 
in  we experienced losses totaling million from twenty seven different catastrophes 
various events can cause catastrophes  including severe winter weather  hurricanes  windstorms  earthquakes  hail  war  terrorism  explosions and fires 
the frequency and severity of these catastrophes are inherently unpredictable 
the extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposures in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event 
our insurance subsidiaries seek to reduce the impact on our business of a catastrophe through geographic diversification and through the purchase of reinsurance covering various categories of catastrophes  which generally excludes terrorism 
nevertheless  reinsurance may prove inadequate if a major catastrophic loss exceeds the reinsurance limit  or an insurance subsidiary pays a number of smaller catastrophic loss claims that  individually  fall below the subsidiary s retention level 
in addition  we use models developed by third party vendors in assessing our property exposure to catastrophe losses that assume various conditions and probability scenarios 
these models do not necessarily accurately predict future losses 
we are heavily regulated in the states in which we operate and if we violate those regulations or if the regulations unreasonably restrict our ability to do business  or if they change significantly  it could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we are subject to extensive supervision and regulation in the states in which we transact business 
the purpose of supervision and regulation is to protect individual policyholders and not stockholders or other investors 
our business can be adversely affected by private passenger automobile insurance regulations and any other regulations affecting property and casualty insurance companies 
for example  laws and regulations can reduce or set 
table of contents rates at levels that we do not believe are adequate for the risks we insure 
other laws and regulations can limit our ability to cancel or refuse to renew policies and require us to offer coverage to all consumers 
changes in laws and regulations  or their interpretations  pertaining to insurance  including workers compensation  may also have a material adverse effect on our business 
although the federal government does not directly regulate the insurance industry  federal initiatives  such as federal terrorism backstop legislation  from time to time  also can impact the insurance industry 
although we do not write health insurance  rules affecting health care services can affect other insurance that we write  including workers compensation and commercial and personal automobile and liability insurance 
we cannot determine whether or in what form additional health care reform legislation may be adopted by the us congress or any state legislature 
we also cannot determine the nature and effect  if any  that the adoption of health care legislation or regulations  or changing interpretations  at the federal or state level would have on us 
in july  the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank act was signed into law 
among other things  the dodd frank act established a federal insurance office within the us department of the treasury and empowered it to gather data and information regarding the insurance industry and insurers 
we cannot predict what impact  if any  the dodd frank act or any other such legislation will have on us 
we currently write flood insurance which is reinsured by the national flood insurance program the nfip 
there have been various legislative proposals to reform or terminate the nfip 
we cannot currently determine whether or in what form legislation may be adopted concerning the nfip and the effect this may have on us 
on january   the south carolina supreme court held in crossmann v harleysville mutual insurance company opinion no 
 january  that a contractor s or subcontractor s negligent faulty work does not constitute an occurrence under the applicable commercial general liability policy 
recently  the south carolina legislature has introduced legislation s  h  h to overturn the crossmann decision 
we can not currently determine whether or in what form such legislation may be adopted and the effect that this may have on harleysville group 
if demand for property and casualty insurance decreases  it could have a material adverse impact on our business 
historically  the results of the property and casualty insurance industry have been subject to significant fluctuations over time due to competition and due to unpredictable developments  including natural and man made disasters  fluctuations in interest rates and other changes in the investment environment that affect returns on our investments  inflationary pressures that affect the size of losses  and legislative and regulatory changes and judicial decisions that affect insurers liabilities 
the demand for property and casualty insurance  particularly commercial lines  also can vary with the overall level of economic activity 
any of the foregoing could reduce the demand for property and casualty insurance  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  including on the amount of premiums earned in any fiscal quarter or fiscal year 
if we are unable to reduce our exposure to risks through reliable reinsurance or if the cost of reinsurance increases  our risk of loss  or the cost of controlling our risk of loss  will increase 
we transfer a portion of our exposure to selected risks to other insurance and reinsurance companies through reinsurance arrangements 
under our reinsurance arrangements  another insurer assumes a specified portion of our losses and loss adjustment expenses in exchange for a specified portion of policy premiums 
the availability  amount and cost of reinsurance depend on market conditions and may vary significantly 
any decrease in the amount of our reinsurance will increase our risk of loss 
furthermore  we face a credit risk when we obtain reinsurance because we are still liable for the transferred risks if the reinsurer cannot meet the transferred obligations 
therefore  the inability of any of our reinsurers to meet its financial obligations could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents the threat of terrorism and military and other actions may result in decreases in our net income  revenue and assets under management and may materially adversely affect our investment portfolio 
the threat of terrorism  both within the united states and abroad  and military and other actions and heightened security measures in response to these types of threats  may cause significant volatility and declines in the equity markets in the united states  europe and elsewhere  as well as loss of life  property damage  additional disruptions to commerce and reduced economic activity 
actual terrorist attacks could cause losses from insurance claims related to the property and casualty insurance operations of harleysville group  as well as a decrease in our shareholders equity  net income and or revenue 
the effects of changes related to harleysville group may result in a decrease in our stock price 
the terrorism risk insurance act of  which was originally extended in and extended again in  requires that some coverage for terrorist loss be offered by primary property insurers and provides federal assistance for recovery of claims through in addition  some of the assets in our investment portfolio may be materially adversely affected by declines in the equity markets and economic activity caused by the continued threat of terrorism  ongoing military and other actions and heightened security measures 
we cannot predict at this time whether and the extent to which industry sectors in which we maintain investments may suffer losses as a result of potential decreased commercial and economic activity  or how any such decrease might impact the ability of companies within the affected industry sectors to pay interest or principal on their securities  or how the value of any underlying collateral might be affected 
we can offer no assurances that the threats of future terrorist like events in the united states and abroad or military actions by the united states will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
certain changes in the accounting standards issued by the financial accounting standards board or other standard setting bodies could have a material adverse impact on our reported net income 
we are subject to the application of us gaap and other accounting standards  which are periodically revised and or expanded 
as such  we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies  including the financial accounting standards board 
it is possible that future changes required to be adopted could change the current accounting treatment that we apply and such changes could result in material adverse impacts on our results of operations and financial condition 
if our investments lose value  our revenues  earnings and financial position will be materially adversely affected 
like many other property and casualty insurance companies  we depend on income from our investment portfolio for a significant portion of our revenues and earnings 
any significant decline in our investment income as a result of falling interest rates  decreased dividend payment rates or general market conditions would have a material adverse effect on our results 
any significant decline in the market value of our investments would reduce our shareholders equity and our policyholders surplus  which could impact our ability to write additional business 
the volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets and adverse changes in the global economy may negatively impact our business 
adverse capital and credit market conditions could affect our ability to meet liquidity needs  as well as our access to capital and cost of capital 
further  if adverse regional  national or international economic conditions persist or worsen  we could experience decreased revenues and shareholders equity 
the capital and credit markets experienced extreme volatility and disruption in the recent past 
the volatility and disruption in the markets exerted downward pressure on the availability of liquidity and credit capacity for certain issuers 
our results of operations  financial condition  cash flows and statutory capital position could be materially adversely affected by continued disruptions in the capital and credit markets 
continued deterioration in the public debt and equity markets could lead to investment losses 
the severe downturn in the public debt and equity markets in  reflecting uncertainties associated with the mortgage crisis  worsening economic conditions  widening of credit spreads  bankruptcies and government intervention in large financial institutions  has resulted in significant realized and unrealized losses in our investment portfolio in the past 
depending on market conditions going forward  we could incur substantial additional realized and unrealized losses in future periods  which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations  financial condition  debt and financial strength ratings and ability to access capital markets 

table of contents if our financial strength ratings are reduced  we may be materially adversely impacted 
insurance companies are subject to financial strength ratings produced by external rating agencies 
higher ratings generally indicate greater financial stability and a stronger ability to pay claims 
ratings are assigned by rating agencies to insurers based upon factors that they believe are relevant to policyholders 
ratings are not recommendations to buy  hold or sell our securities 
although other agencies cover the property and casualty industry  we believe our ability to write business is most influenced by our financial strength rating from a 
m 
best 
according to a 
m 
best  its ratings are designed to assess an insurer s financial strength and ability to meet ongoing policyholder obligations 
currently  our rating from a 
m 
best is a  or excellent 
a rating below a from a 
m 
best could materially adversely affect the business we write 
both moody s and standard poor s also assign financial strength ratings to the company 
our moody s rating is a and our standard poor s rating is a 
while we consider our financial strength ratings from these rating agencies important  we believe that they have less impact on our business compared to our financial strength rating from a 
m 
best 
in addition to being assigned financial strength ratings  the company is also assigned credit ratings 
we consider our credit ratings from moody s and standard poor s to be most important with regard to our ability to access capital markets 
our current credit rating from moody s is baa with a stable outlook while our standard poor s credit rating is bbb with a stable outlook 
we cannot be sure we will maintain our current investment grade credit ratings 
an unfavorable change in our moody s or standard poor s credit rating to below investment grade could make it more expensive for us to access capital markets 
risks related to our company in particular we face significant competition from other regional and national insurance companies  agents and from self insurance  which may result in lower revenues 
we compete with local  regional and national insurance companies  including direct writers of insurance coverage 
many of these competitors are larger than we are and many have greater financial  technical and operating resources 
in addition  we face competition within each insurance agency that sells our insurance because we sell through independent agencies that represent several insurance companies 
the property and casualty insurance industry is highly competitive on the basis of product  price and service 
if our competitors offer products with more coverage  or price their products more aggressively  our ability to grow or renew our business may be materially adversely impacted 
there are more than groups writing property and casualty insurance in the united states  and we rank among the top in size 
our most significant competitors vary significantly in our different lines of business and in the geographic markets in which we compete 
the internet also could emerge as a significant source of new competition  both from existing competitors using their brand name and resources to write business through this distribution channel and from new competitors 
we also face competition because of entities that self insure  primarily in the commercial insurance market 
from time to time  certain of our customers and potential customers may examine the benefits and risks of self insurance and other alternatives to traditional insurance 
a number of new  proposed or potential legislative or industry developments could further increase competition in the property and casualty insurance industry 
these developments include programs in which state sponsored entities provide property insurance in catastrophe prone areas or other alternative market types of coverage  and changing practices caused by the internet  which have led to greater competition in the insurance business and  in some cases  greater expectations for customer service 
new competition from these developments could cause the supply or demand for insurance to change  which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents if adverse conditions in the eastern and midwestern united states exist  our business would be disproportionately impacted 
we primarily write property and casualty insurance business in the eastern and midwestern united states 
consequently  unusually severe storms or other natural or man made disasters that destroy property in these states could materially adversely affect our operations 
our revenues and profitability also are subject to prevailing economic and regulatory conditions in the states in which we write insurance 
we may be exposed to risks of adverse developments that are greater than if we conducted business nationwide 
we depend on independent insurance agents  which exposes us to risks not applicable to companies with dedicated agents 
we market and sell our insurance products through independent  non exclusive insurance agencies 
these agencies are not obligated to sell our insurance products  and generally they also sell our competitors insurance products 
as a result  our business depends in part on the marketing and sales efforts of these agencies 
if we diversify and expand our business geographically  then we may need to expand our network of agencies to successfully market our products 
if these agencies fail to market our products successfully  our business may be materially adversely impacted 
also  independent agents may decide to sell their businesses to banks  other insurance agencies or other businesses 
changes in ownership of agencies  or expansion of agencies through acquisition  could adversely affect an agency s ability to control growth and profitability  thereby adversely affecting our business 
if our insurance subsidiaries are not able to pay adequate dividends to us  our ability to meet our obligations and pay dividends would be adversely affected 
our principal assets are the shares of capital stock of our insurance company subsidiaries 
we principally rely on dividends from our insurance company subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations and for paying corporate expenses and dividends to stockholders 
the payment of dividends by our insurance company subsidiaries is subject to regulatory restrictions and will depend on the surplus and future earnings of these subsidiaries  as well as other regulatory restrictions 
as a result  we may not be able to receive dividends from these subsidiaries at times and in amounts necessary to meet our obligations or to allow us to pay dividends 
if insurance regulators determine that payment of a dividend to our holding company would be detrimental to an insurance subsidiary s policyholders or creditors  because of the financial condition of the insurance subsidiary or otherwise  the regulators may block dividends that would otherwise be permitted without prior approval 
our subsidiaries are permitted under the terms of our debt agreement for our million notes due to incur additional indebtedness that may restrict or prohibit the making of distributions  the payment of dividends or the making of loans by our subsidiaries to us 
we cannot assure you that the agreements governing the current and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries will permit our subsidiaries to provide us with sufficient dividends  distributions or loans to fund payments on these notes when due 
although we have paid cash dividends in the past  we may not be able to pay cash dividends in the future 
we have a history of paying dividends to our stockholders when sufficient cash is available 
however  future cash dividends will depend upon our results of operations  financial condition  cash requirements and other factors  including the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions to us  which ability is restricted in the manner previously discussed in this section 
also  there can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends even if the necessary financial conditions are met and if sufficient cash is available for distribution 
if our use of predictive modeling or other underwriting tools is not effective  our business could be materially adversely impacted 
we use predictive modeling and other underwriting tools in underwriting a significant portion of our commercial lines business 
we believe these tools allow us to more accurately match underwriting risk with pricing to operate more profitably 
if the tools do not accurately reflect the level of losses that we ultimately will incur  our ability to write business and our financial results could be materially adversely affected 

table of contents if our technology initiatives are not successful  or the benefits are not realized  our business could be materially adversely affected 
our businesses are increasingly dependent on technology 
our inability to anticipate or manage problems with technology  or fully realize the expected benefits from investments in technology  could materially adversely affect our ability to write business and could materially adversely impact our financial results 
if we lose our key personnel our business could be materially adversely affected 
the success of our business is dependent  to a large extent  on our ability to attract and retain key employees  in particular our senior officers and key management  sales  information systems  underwriting  claims and corporate personnel 
competition to attract and retain key personnel is intense 
although we have change in control agreements with a number of key managers  in general  we do not have employment contracts or non compete arrangements with  or key person insurance covering  our employees  including our key employees 
applicable insurance laws and certain provisions in our certificate of incorporation make it difficult to effect a change of control of our company  and the mutual company has significant influence over potential change of control transactions  which could affect our share value 
under applicable insurance laws and regulations of the states in which our subsidiaries are domiciled  no person may acquire control of us unless that person has filed a statement containing specified information with the insurance commissioner of each state and obtains advance approval for such acquisition 
under applicable laws and regulations  any person acquiring  directly or indirectly by revocable proxy or otherwise  or more of the voting stock of any other person is presumed to have acquired control of such person  and a person who beneficially acquires or more of our common stock without obtaining advance approval of the insurance commissioner of each state would be in violation of applicable insurance laws and would be subject to injunctive action requiring disposition or seizure of the shares and prohibiting the voting of such shares  as well as other action determined by the insurance commissioner of each such state 
in addition  many state insurance laws require prior notification to the state insurance department of a change of control of a non domiciliary insurance company licensed to transact an insurance business in that state 
although these pre notification statutes do not authorize the state insurance departments to disapprove the change of control  they authorize regulatory action including a possible revocation of our authority to do business in the affected state if particular conditions exist such as undue market concentration 
any future transactions that would constitute a change of control of us may require prior notification in the states that have pre acquisition notification laws 
as of december   the mutual company owned approximately of our outstanding common stock 
the mutual company s stock ownership and ability  by reason of such ownership  to elect our board of directors  provides it with significant influence over potential change of control transactions 
further  section of the delaware general corporation law provides that if a person acquires or more of our voting stock  the person is an interested stockholder and may not engage in business combinations with us for a period of three years from the time the person acquired or more of our voting stock  subject to certain exceptions 
section may discourage a potential change of control transaction 
our board of directors is divided into three classes a  b and c 
the current three year terms of class a  b and c directors expire in  and  respectively 
this classification of our board of directors could have the effect of discouraging a potential change in control transaction 
finally  our certificate of incorporation permits our board of directors to issue up to one million shares of preferred stock having such terms  including voting rights  as the board of directors shall fix and determine
