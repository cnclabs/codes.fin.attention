table of contents part i item business background of india globalization capital  inc igc igc  a maryland corporation  was organized on april  as a blank check company formed for the purpose of acquiring one or more businesses with operations primarily in india through a merger  capital stock exchange  asset acquisition or other similar business combination or acquisition 
on march   we completed an initial public offering 
on february   we incorporated india globalization capital  mauritius  limited igc m  a wholly owned subsidiary  under the laws of mauritius 
on march   we consummated the acquisition of of the equity of sricon infrastructure private limited sricon and of the equity of techni bharathi limited tbl 
we acquired sricon by purchasing a interest for approximately million based on an exchange rate of inr for usd 
subsequently  we borrowed  through an intermediary company  approximately million based on inr for usd from sricon 
the shares of the two indian companies  sricon and tbl  are held by igc m 
effective october   we reduced our stake in sricon from to in consideration for the set off of the loan owed by igc approximating million 
on february  igc m beneficially purchased of igc mining and trading private limited igc imt based in chennai  india 
igc imt was formed on december  as a privately held start up company engaged in the business of mining and trading 
its current activity is to operate shipping hubs and to export iron ore to china from india 
on july   igc m beneficially purchased of igc materials  private limited igc mpl based in nagpur  india  which conducts igc s quarrying business  and of igc logistics  private limited igc lpl based in nagpur  india  which is involved in the transport and delivery of ore  cement  aggregate and other materials 
each of igc imt  igc mpl and igc lpl were formed by third parties at the behest of igc m to facilitate the creation of the subsidiaries 
the purchase price paid for each of igc imt  igc mpl  and igc lpl was equal to the expenses incurred in incorporating the respective entities with no premium paid 
india globalization capital  inc the registrant  the company  or we and its subsidiaries are engaged in the sale of construction materials  mining  quarrying and construction 
igc s organizational structure is as follows 
table of contents unless the context requires otherwise  all references in this report to the company  igc  igc inc  we  our  and us refer to india globalization capital  inc  together with its wholly owned subsidiary igc m  and its direct and indirect subsidiaries tbl  igc imt  igc mpl and igc lpl and sricon  in which we hold a non controlling interest 
overview igc materials  private limited igc mpl and igc logistics  private limited igc lpl are based in nagpur india and were incorporated in june the two companies focus on infrastructure materials like rock aggregate  bricks  concrete and other building materials  as well as  logistical support for the transportation of infrastructure materials 
igc india mining and trading igc imt was incorporated in december in chennai  india 
igc imt is focused on the export of iron ore to china as well as the sale of iron ore to customers in india 
igc mpl  igc lpl and igc imt are all wholly owned subsidiaries of igc m 
techni bharathi limited tbl was incorporated as a public but not listed on the stock exchange limited company on june  in cochin  india 
tbl is an engineering and construction company engaged in the execution of civil construction  structural engineering projects and trading 
tbl has a focus in the indian states of kerala  karnataka  assam and tamil nadu 
its present and past clients include various indian government organizations 
our approach is to offer integrated solutions to our customers such as construction services combined with the sale and transportation of materials 
core business competencies as the infrastructure in india is built out and modernized  the demand for basic raw materials like stone aggregate and iron ore steel is expected to increase 
we offer an integrated set of services to our customers based upon several core competencies 
this integrated approach provides us with an advantage over our competitors 
our core business competencies are a sophisticated  integrated approach to project modeling  costing  management  and monitoring 
in depth knowledge of southern and central indian infrastructure development 
knowledge of low cost logistics for moving commodities across long distances in specific parts of india 
in depth knowledge of the licensing process for mines and quarries in southern and central india 
strong relationships with several important construction companies and mine operators in southern and central india 
our core business areas are mining and trading 
our mining and trading activity currently centers on the export of iron ore to china and the resale of iron ore to traders in india 
india is the fourth largest producer of iron ore 
the freedonia group projected in may that china s trillion construction industry would grow every year until this growth will increase china s already large demand for steel 
china  which accounted for million metric tons of steel production in  is expected to produce between million and million metric tons in as the wall street journal reported  this production is expected to be almost half of total global output 
we believe that igc is well positioned to provide some chinese steel mills with the iron ore needed to meet their demand 
our subsidiary igc mining and trading private limited igc imt  based in chennai  india  is engaged in the iron ore business 
the subsidiary has relationships and in some cases agreements with mine owners in orissa and karnataka  two of the largest ore mining belts in india 
in addition  it operates facilities at seaports on the west coast of india and to a lesser extent on the east coast of india 
the facilities consist of an office and a plot of land within the port to store iron ore 
our staff is experienced in delivering and managing the logistics of ore transport 
our subsidiary services a customer in china by buying ore from indian mine owners  transporting it to seaports and then subcontracting stevedores to load the ships 
our share of the export market for iron ore is less than 

table of contents quarrying rock aggregate 
as indian infrastructure modernizes  the demand for raw materials like rock aggregate  iron ore and similar resources is projected to greatly increase 
in  according to the freedonia group  india was the third largest stone aggregate market in the world 
the report projected that indian demand for crushed stone will increase to million metric tons in and billion metric tons in our subsidiary  igc materials private limited igc mpl  is responsible for our rock aggregate production 
the subsidiary currently has two quarrying agreements with two separate partners 
the two quarries being mined near nagpur  a city in the state of maharashtra  india  have approximately million to million metric tons of rock aggregate  or about  of reserves at current prices 
with the production of these two quarries  our subsidiary is one of the largest suppliers in the immediate area 
our share of the overall market in india is currently less than 
however  igc mpl has a growing regional presence in the nagpur area 
all quarrying or mining activities in india require a license 
igc and its subsidiaries do not directly hold any mining or quarrying licenses and therefore there are no licenses or expenses in connection with acquiring the same being reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
however  sricon holds licenses and we quarry under licenses held by our partners 
for all quarries  the licenses are granted for two years 
the licenses are automatically renewed for additional periods of two years  provided that all royalty payments and taxes to the indian government are paid up to date 
igc mpl has applied  on its own  for licenses for mining and quarrying 
the process of obtaining a quarrying license is difficult and typically takes between months 
the process involves a competitive application process 
as such  while we have applied for licenses  there is no assurance that we will be granted these licenses 
igc mpl is also in active negotiations with other land and license owners to expand the number of producing quarries available to it 
highway and heavy construction 
the indian government has developed a plan to build and modernize indian infrastructure 
the wall street journal reported on march  that the government plans to double infrastructure spending from billion to trillion 
it will pay for the expansion and construction of rural roads  major highways  airports  seaports  freight corridors  railroads and townships 
a significant number of our customers are engaged in highway and heavy construction 
our subsidiary techni bharathi limited tbl  a small road building company  is engaged in highway and heavy construction activities 
tbl has constructed highways  rural roads  tunnels  dams  airport runways  and housing complexes  mostly in southern states 
tbl  because of its successful execution of contracts  is pre qualified by the national highway authority of india nhai and other agencies 
tbl s share of the overall indian construction market is very small 
however  tbl s prequalification and prior track record provides a way to grow the company in highway and heavy construction 
currently  tbl is engaged in the recovery of construction delay claims that it is pursuing against nhai  the airport authority of cochin  and the orissa state works 
our share of the overall market in india is significantly less than 
construction and maintenance of high temperature plants 
through our unconsolidated  minority interest in sricon infrastructure private limited sricon  we engage in the civil engineering  construction and maintenance of high temperature plants 
sricon also has the specialized skills required to build and maintain high temperature chimneys and kilns 
sricon s share of this market in india is less than 
we currently hold equity in sricon 
the following table sets out the revenue contribution from our subsidiaries subsidiary year ended march  year ended march  tbl sricon igc imt igc mpl igc lpl total de consolidated effective october  according to the global market researcher empulse  the construction industry s total market size in india is approximately billion 
according to reuters  india exports about million tons of iron ore per year 
prices for iron ore have averaged around per metric ton 
the rock aggregate market is india is approximately billion 
as noted above  our share of these markets is less than 

table of contents customers 
our present and past customers include the national highway authority of india  several state high way authorities  the indian railways  private construction companies in india and several steel mills in china 
construction contract bidding process 
in order to create transparency  the indian government has centralized the contract awarding process for building inter state roads 
the new process is as follows at the federal level  nhai publishes a statement of work for an interstate highway construction project 
the statement of work has a detailed description of the work to be performed  as well as  the completion time frame 
the bidder prepares two proposals in response to the statement of work 
the first proposal demonstrates technical capabilities  prior work experience  specialized machinery  manpower required  and other qualifications required to complete the project 
the second proposal includes a financial bid 
nhai evaluates the technical bids and short lists technically qualified companies 
next  the short list of technically qualified companies are invited to place a detailed financial bid and show adequate financial strength in terms of revenue  net worth  credit lines  and balance sheets 
generally  the lowest bid wins the contract 
additionally  contract bidders must meet several requirements to demonstrate an adequate level of capital reserves an earnest money deposit between to of project costs  a performance guarantee of between and  an adequate overall working capital  and additional capital available for plant and machinery 
bidding qualifications for larger nhai projects are set by nhai and are imposed on each contractor 
as the contractor actually executes larger highway projects  then the contractor may qualify for even larger projects 
growth strategy and business model 
our growth strategy and business model are to deepen our relationships with our existing construction customers by providing them infrastructure materials like iron ore  rock aggregate  concrete  coal and associated logistical support 
expand our materials offering by expanding the number of rock aggregate quarries and other materials 
leverage our expertise in the logistics and supply of iron ore by increasing the number of shipping hubs we operate from and continue to expand our offering into china and other asian countries in order to take advantage of their expected strong infrastructure growth 
expand the number of recurring contracts for infrastructure build out to customers that can benefit from our portfolio of offerings 
competition 
we operate in an industry that is competitive 
however  the industry is fragmented and while a number of our competitors are well qualified and better financed than we are  we believe that the demand for contractors in general will permit us to compete for projects and contracts that are appropriate for our size and capabilities 
large domestic and international firms compete for jumbo contracts over million in size  while locally based contractors vie for contracts worth less than million 
we seek to compete in the gap between these two ends of the competitive spectrum 
the recent capital markets crisis has made it more difficult for smaller companies to grow to mid sized companies because their access to capital has been restrained 
while we are also constrained by capital we believe that we are in a better position to secure capital than a number of small  purely local competitors 
our construction business is positioned in the million to million contract range  above locally based contractors and below the large firms  creating a distinct technical and financial advantage in this market niche assuming that we can maintain access to capital 
rock aggregate is generally supplied to the industry through small crushing units  which supply low quality material 
frequently  high quality aggregate is unavailable  or is transported over large distances 
we fill this gap by providing high quality material in large quantities 
we compete on price  quantity and quality 
iron ore is produced in india  where our core assets are located  and exported to china 
while this is a fairly established and relatively efficient market  we compete by aggregating ore from smaller suppliers who do not have direct access to customers in china 
further  we expect to install a large iron ore crusher that can grind ore pebbles into fine ore particles  providing a value added service to the smaller mine owners 

table of contents seasonality 
the road building and construction industries typically experience naturally recurring seasonal patterns throughout india 
the northeast monsoons historically arrive on june  followed by the southwest monsoons which usually continue intermittently until september 
historically  the business in the monsoon months is slower than in other months because of the heavy rains 
activities such as engineering and maintenance of high temperature plants are less susceptible to weather delays  while the iron ore export business slows down somewhat due to the rough seas 
flooding in the quarries can slow production in the stone aggregate industry during the monsoon season 
however  our quarries build stone reserves prior to the monsoon season 
the monsoon season has historically been used to bid and win contracts for construction and for the supply of ore and aggregate in preparation for work activity when the rains abate 
employees and consultants 
as of march  we employed a work force of approximately employees and contract workers worldwide 
employees are typically skilled workers including executives  welders  drivers  and other specialized experts 
contract workers require less specialized skills 
we make diligent efforts to comply with all employment and labor regulations  including immigration laws in the many jurisdictions in which we operate 
in order to attract and retain skilled employees  we have implemented a performance based incentive program  offered career development programs  improved working conditions  and provided united states work assignments  technology training  and other fringe benefits 
we hope that our efforts will make our companies more attractive 
environmental regulations 
india has strict environmental  occupational  health and safety regulations 
in most instances  the contracting agency regulates and enforces all regulatory requirements 
we internally monitor and manage regulatory issues on a continuous basis 
we believe that we are in compliance with all the regulatory requirements of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
furthermore  we do not believe that compliance will have a material adverse effect on our business activities 
current chinese currency revaluation 
bloomberg news reported on december  that us senators are strongly encouraging china to hold up to their promise to re institute a managed floating exchange rate 
also  they reported that the yuan is the best performer of the bric countries and has appreciated to the dollar in the past decade 
if a similar appreciation occurs  it will increase the purchasing power of chinese steel mills buying iron ore  which is traded in usd 
chinese firms could buy more ore  even at a higher price  and igc would benefit from an appreciation of the yuan 
information and timely financial reporting 
our operations are located in india where the accepted accounting standard is the indian gaap  which  in many cases  is not congruent with the us gaap 
indian accounting standards are evolving toward ifrs international financial reporting standards 
we engage an independent public accounting firm registered with the us pcaob to conduct an annual audit of our financial statements 
the process of producing financial statements is at times cumbersome and places significant demands upon our existing staff 
we believe we are still some time away from having processes and adequately trained personnel in place to meet the reporting timetables set out by us reporting requirements 
until then we may  on occasion  have to file for extensions to meet us reporting timetables and it is possible that we may fail to meet these time tables 
failure to file our reports in a timely fashion can result in severe consequences including the potential delisting of our securities 
in addition  our access to capital may become more difficult or limited if we fail to meet reporting deadlines 
we will make our annual reports  quarterly reports  proxy statements  and up to date investor presentations available on our web site  www 
indiaglobalcap 
com as soon as they are available 
our sec filings are also available  free of charge  at www

table of contents item a 
risk factors the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the company  its business condition and prospects  financial and otherwise 
many investment opportunities involve risk factors or a risk of loss and the existence of both normal and extraordinary risks 
any downgrading of india s debt rating by an international rating agency  or an increase in interest rates in india  could have a negative impact on our ability to borrow in india 
as we scale our operations we expect to increase the amount of money we borrow for working capital and the leasing of equipment 
any adverse revisions to india s credit ratings for domestic and international debt by international rating agencies  as well as  an increase in indian interest rates may adversely impact our ability to finance growth through debt and could lead to a tightening of our operating margins  adversely affecting our operating income 
fortunately  most large debt rating agencies  including standard poor s and moody s  consider india s debt stable 
a change in government policy  a downturn in the indian or chinese economy  or a natural disaster could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and future prospects 
the construction business is dependent on the central government of india  as well as the indian state governments for contracts 
our operations and financial results may be affected by changes in the government s policy toward building infrastructure 
in addition  the recent slowdown in the indian economy has caused a tightening of credit and a slowdown of companies bidding on government contracts 
we foresee no immediate changes to government policy or market conditions that would adversely affect our ability to conduct business other than limited access to credit and believe that government support for infrastructure spending will remain strong but we remain subject to possible changes in indian government and monetary policies and regulations  which are beyond our control 
the indian government currently bans the export of ore that has a ferrous content of or more  preferring to keep that high grade ore for the production of steel in india 
the indian government could further curtail the export of iron ore  thereby hampering our business 
if the government were to impose a ban on the export of lesser quality ore  we would likely be forced to service our customers from sources other than india 
in addition  during  the government of karnataka state banned the transportation and export of iron ore from ports on the west coast of india due to allegations of illegal mining  storage  and transportation 
the ban was initially upheld by the karnataka high court until regulatory action could be implemented to reduce the illegal activity 
iron ore exporters appealed against the ban to the indian supreme court 
the supreme court passed an order lifting the ban on iron ore exports from karnataka in april this order was again challenged by the state government citing that the government needed more time to institute checks against illegal mining and export of iron ore 
the matter is again pending adjudication at the apex court and is likely to be resolved in the next few months 
a significant portion of our iron ore exports along with other companies from karnataka continue to be impacted by this ban 
the chinese government imposed a ban on the import of low grade iron ore by traders in china in april this ban did not extend to chinese steel mills with licenses to import iron ore 
we have generally been in the business of exporting ore with ferrous content between and low grade 
the ban on the import of low quality ore by china  although revoked on september  forced us to look for customers that are steel mills  which we did  and to shift the business to exporting higher quality ore  which we are now doing 
we have shifted our business to exporting ore with ferrous content above 
however  further restrictions on the import of iron ore by the chinese government could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
political  economic  social and other factors in india may adversely affect business 
our ability to grow our business may be adversely affected by political  economic  social and religious factors  changes in indian law or regulations  and the status of india s relations with other countries 
in addition  the economy of india may differ favorably or unfavorably from the us economy in such things as the rate of growth of gross domestic product  the inflation rate  capital reinvestment  resource self sufficiency  and balance of payments position 
indian government actions in the future could have a significant effect on the indian economy  which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our business objectives 

table of contents since mid  the indian government has committed itself to implementing an economic structural reform program with the object of liberalizing india s exchange and trade policies  reducing the fiscal deficit  controlling inflation  promoting a sound monetary policy  reforming the financial sector  and placing greater reliance on market mechanisms to direct economic activity 
according to the world factbook published by the us central intelligence agency  the indian government increased the pace of privatization in its transition from government control and toward a free market economy 
a significant component of the program is the promotion of foreign investment in key areas of the economy 
while the indian government s policies have resulted in improved economic performance  there can be no assurance that the economic improvement will be sustained 
moreover  there can be no assurance that these economic reforms will continue or that any newly elected government will continue the program of economic liberalization of previous governments 
any change may adversely affect indian laws and policies with respect to foreign investment and currency exchange 
such changes in economic policies could negatively affect general business and economic conditions in india  which could  in turn  adversely affect our business 
terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war within india or involving india and other countries could adversely affect the financial markets and our business 
terrorist attacks and other acts of violence could have the direct effect of destroying our plants and property causing a loss and interruption of business 
according to the cia world factbook  religious and border disputes persist in india and remain pressing problems 
for example  india has from time to time experienced civil unrest and hostilities with pakistan and other neighboring countries 
the longstanding dispute with pakistan over the border indian states of jammu and kashmir  a majority of whose populations are muslim  remains unresolved 
while india and pakistan resumed formal peace talks  there are no guarantees that these will be successful 
in addition  india continues to struggle with insurgent attacks from maoist naxalite groups 
if the indian government is unable to control the violence and disruption associated with these insurgencies  then the result could be the destabilization of the economy  and  consequently  an adverse effect on our business 
since early  there have also been military hostilities and civil unrest in afghanistan  in iraq  and more recently in pakistan and other asian countries 
these events could adversely affect the indian economy  and  as a result  negatively impact our business 
while we may have insurance to cover some of these risks and can file claims against the indian contracting agencies  there can be no guarantee that we will be able to collect in a timely manner 
further  india has a fairly active insurgency and a fairly active communist following 
any serious uprising from these groups could delay our roadwork and disrupt our business 
terrorist attacks  insurgencies  or other threats of violence could slow down road building activity and the production of iron ore and rock aggregate  thereby adversely affecting our business 
exchange controls that exist in india may limit our ability to utilize our cash flow effectively following a business combination 
we are subject to india s rules and regulations on currency conversion 
in india  the foreign exchange management act  fema  regulates the conversion of the indian rupee into foreign currencies 
however  as according to the reserve bank of india  comprehensive amendments have been made to fema to support the government s policy for economic liberalization 
companies are now permitted to operate in india without any special restrictions  effectively placing them on a par with wholly owned indian companies 
in addition  foreign exchange controls have been substantially relaxed 
notwithstanding these changes  the indian foreign exchange market is not yet fully developed and we cannot assure that the indian authorities will not revert back to regulating companies and imposing new restrictions on the convertibility of the indian rupee 
any future restrictions on currency exchange may limit our ability to use our cash flow to fund operations outside of india 
changes in the exchange rate of the indian rupee may negatively impact our revenues and expenses 
our operations are primarily located in india 
we receive payment in indian rupees for the construction work and the sale of rock aggregate 
our contracts to supply iron ore to chinese companies are paid in us dollars 
as the results of our operations are reported in us dollars  to the extent that there is a decrease in the exchange rate of indian rupees relative to us dollars  such a decrease could have a material impact on our operating results or financial condition 
this is unlikely because  as the wall street journal reported in mid april  the rupee in expected to appreciate another against the dollar by the end of the year 

table of contents returns on investment in indian companies may be decreased by withholding and other taxes 
our investments in india will incur tax risks unique to investments in india and in developing economies in general 
income that might otherwise not be subject to the withholding of local income tax under normal international conventions may become subject to the withholding of indian income tax 
under treaties with india and under local indian income tax law  income is generally sourced in india and subject to indian tax if paid from india 
this is true whether or not the services or the earning of the income would normally be considered as being from sources outside india in other contexts 
additionally  proof of payment for indian income taxes may be required as part of the remittance procedure 
any indian taxes paid by us on income from our investments in india may or may not be creditable on our us income tax returns 
we may also incur taxes in india on any profits that we may choose to distribute as dividends to our shareholders 
we intend to avail ourselves of income tax treaties with india and minimize any indian withholding tax or local taxes 
however  there is no assurance that the indian tax authorities will always recognize such treaties and their application to us 
we have also created a foreign subsidiary in mauritius  in order to limit the potential tax exposure 
lack of availability of raw materials at competitive prices may negatively impact our profits 
construction contracts are primarily dependent on adequate and timely supply of raw materials  such as cement  steel and aggregates  at competitive prices 
as the demand from competing larger and well established material supply firms increases for procuring raw materials  we could face a disproportionate increase in the price of raw materials that may negatively impact our profitability 
to mitigate this risk  we are taking steps to become more vertically integrated  such as producing rock aggregate 
some of our business is dependent on contracts awarded by the indian government and its agencies 
the construction business is dependent on central and state indian government budget allocations to the infrastructure sector 
we derive the bulk of our construction revenue from contracts awarded by the indian central and state governments and their agencies 
if there are delays in payments by the government  our working capital requirements could increase 
our materials business is dependent on private sector companies which could be affected by government delays  indirectly burdening our business 
compliance with the foreign corrupt practices act could adversely impact our competitive position 
failure to comply could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences 
we are subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act  which generally prohibits us public companies from engaging in bribery of or other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business 
while we will take precautions to educate the employees of our subsidiaries on the provisions of the foreign corrupt practices act  there can be no assurance that we or the employees or agents of our subsidiaries will not engage in such conduct  for which we might be held responsible 
we could suffer penalties that would have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we may issue additional shares of our capital stock  including through convertible debt securities  which would reduce the equity interest of our stockholders and possibly cause a change in control of our ownership 
our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to  shares of common stock  par value per share and  shares of preferred stock  par value per share 
there are currently approximately  authorized but unissued shares of our common stock available for issuance 
this is after appropriate reservation for the issuance of shares upon full exercise of our outstanding warrants and shares and options authorized for issuance under our omnibus incentive plan 
it is also after the reservation for conversion of all of the  shares of preferred stock available for issuance 

table of contents we issued an aggregate of  shares of our common stock in connection with a private placement of debt securities and exchange of previously issued debt securities for new debt securities and common stock in october  november  december  february and march   and may engage in similar private placements in the future 
in addition  we may from time to time sell shares at the market 
the issuance of additional shares of our common stock including the conversion of any debt securities may significantly reduce the equity interest of our existing shareholders 
adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock  warrants or units 
we may issue notes or other debt securities  which may adversely affect our leverage and financial condition 
during the and fiscal years  we sold an aggregate  in private placements of debt securities and may engage in similar private placements in the future 
in the current year  we have modified the terms of the debt arrangement to extend the repayment under the agreements and as a consideration for this extension issued equity shares to the debt holders 
the incurrence of this debt and any subsequent modifications to the terms may lead to default if our operating revenues are insufficient to pay our debt obligations  cause an acceleration of our obligations to repay the debt even if we make all principal and interest payments when due if we breach the covenants contained in the terms of the debt documents  create an obligation to immediately repay all principal and accrued interest  if any  upon demand to the extent any debt securities are payable on demand  hinder our ability to obtain additional financing  if necessary  to the extent any debt securities contain covenants restricting our ability to obtain additional financing while such securities are outstanding  or to the extent our existing leverage discourages other potential investors  and potentially lead to a dilution of our ownership if there are any subsequent issues of equity shares as consideration for further modifications or settlements 
additional capital may be costly or difficult to obtain 
additional capital  whether through the offering of equity or debt securities  may not be available on reasonable terms or at all 
if we are unable to obtain required additional capital  we may have to curtail our growth plans or cut back on existing business 
furthermore  we may not be able to continue operating if we do not generate sufficient revenues from operations needed to stay in business 
we may incur substantial costs in pursuing future capital financing  including investment banking fees  legal fees  accounting fees  securities law compliance fees  printing and distribution expenses and other costs 
these costs may be increased because we may not currently be able to use a short form registration statement on form s which will increase the costs and timing for any registered offering of our securities 
in addition  to the extent that we are unable to provide timely reporting of our financial results it may further impair our ability to raise capital 
we may also be required to recognize non cash expenses in connection with certain securities we issue  such as  convertible notes and warrants  which may adversely impact our financial condition 
assessment of penalties for time overruns and lack of quality may adversely affect our economic performance 
tbl executes construction contracts primarily in the roads and infrastructure development sectors 
tbl typically enters into high value contracts for these activities  which impose penalties if the contracts are not executed in a timely manner 
if tbl is unable to meet the performance criteria prescribed by the contracts  then levied penalties may adversely affect our financial performance 
furthermore  we may pay demurrage for some of our iron ore delivery contracts  if ore is not loaded onto ships in the time prescribed by delivery contracts 
the payment of demurrage may adversely affect our financial performance 
the ore shipped by us from india is shipped with a quality certificate from a leading company 
however the buyers in china also perform quality measurements  which could differ from the initial quality certificate 
this may result in negative price adjustments affecting our profit margins 
the rock aggregate business is less sensitive to time overruns and quality 

table of contents our business is dependent on continuing relationships with clients and strategic partners 
our business requires developing and maintaining strategic alliances with contractors that undertake turnkey contracts for infrastructure development projects and with government organizations 
the business and our results could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain continuing relationships and pre qualified status with key clients and strategic partners 
our business model relies heavily on our management team and any unexpected loss of key officers may adversely affect our operations 
the continued success of our business is largely dependent on the continued services of key employees 
the loss of the services of certain key personnel  without adequate replacement  could have an adverse effect on our performance 
us senior management and the senior management of our subsidiaries have played a significant role in developing and executing the overall business plan 
they are also vitally important to maintaining client relationships  proprietary processes  and technology 
while no one is irreplaceable  the loss of the services of any of our officers would be disrupting to our business 
our strategy  management  financial and operational oversight are heavily dependent on our founder and ceo 
the loss of our ceo could have a significant adverse effect on our business 
in order to mitigate this risk factor we are recruiting professional managers and expanding our executive ranks  as well as  developing a succession plan  but there can be no guarantees that our mitigation efforts will be successful 
quarterly financial results will vary 
factors that may contribute to the variability of quarterly revenue  operating results or profitability include fluctuations in revenue due to seasonality 
during the monsoon season  the heavy rains slow down construction work resulting in an overall slowdown of the supply of materials and construction activity 
this results in uneven revenue and operating results through the quarters 
in general  the months between june and september are the rainy seasons and these tend to be slower quarters 
the availability of enough ships to transport iron ore during any particular quarter 
commencement  completion and termination of contracts during any particular quarter 
additions and departures of key personnel 
claims filed for delays in the execution and changes in the scope of contracts  among others  can sometimes enter arbitration and take time to settle 
this could result in a tightening of working capital 
strategic decisions made by us and our competitors  such as acquisitions  divestitures  spin offs  joint ventures  strategic investments and changes in business strategy 
our revenue recognition policy records contract revenue for those stages of a project that we complete after we receive certification from the client that the stage has been successfully completed 
since revenue is not recorded until we receive a certification from our clients  revenue recognition can be uneven 

table of contents our future operating results and the market price of our common stock could be materially adversely affected if we are required to write down the carrying value of goodwill and investment associated with any of our businesses in the future 
we review our goodwill balance and investments for impairment on at least an annual basis through the application of a fair value based test 
our estimate of fair value is based primarily on projected future results and cash flows and other assumptions 
in addition  we review long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year  we performed our annual test for goodwill and investment impairment and determined that our goodwill arising on account of the acquisition of tbl and our investment in sricon was further impaired 
similarly  in the future  if our projected discounted cash flows or the recoverable value of the underlying assets associated with our businesses do not exceed the carrying value of their net assets  we may be required to record further write downs of the carrying value of other long lived assets associated with our businesses 
if that is the case  then our operating results and the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected 
our subsidiaries may become involved in litigation in the future 
our construction and aggregate contracts are subject to the jurisdiction of the indian courts 
our iron ore contracts frequently are subject to the jurisdiction of other foreign countries 
our subsidiaries may have to initiate actions in the indian courts or in foreign courts to enforce their rights and may also be drawn into litigation 
the expenses of litigation and any judgments against us could have an adverse effect on us 
we face competition in the infrastructure industry 
the indian real estate and infrastructure industries  including the mining industries  are increasingly attracting foreign capital 
we currently have competition from international and domestic companies that operate at the national level 
smaller localized contractors and companies are also competing in their respective regions 
if we are unable to offer competitive prices and obtain contracts  there could be a significant reduction in our revenue 
a downturn in the economy could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and future prospects 
a generally adverse financial global economy or a regional recession including one in india and or in china could adversely affect commodity prices and infrastructure build out in asia  which in turn could adversely affect our future performance and result in a drop in our stock price 
our operations are sensitive to weather conditions 
our business activities in india could be adversely affected by severe weather conditions 
severe weather conditions may require us to evacuate personnel or curtail services and may result in damage to a portion of our fleet of equipment or to our facilities 
this might result in the suspension of operations  and may prevent us from delivering materials to project sites in accordance with contract schedules or generally reduce our productivity 
difficult working conditions and extremely high temperatures also adversely affect our operations during the summer months and during the monsoon season  which restrict our ability to carry on construction activities and fully utilize our resources 
depending on the onset of the monsoons  revenue recorded in the first half of our fiscal year  particularly between june and september  is traditionally lower than revenue recorded during the second half of our fiscal year 
during periods of curtailed activity due to adverse weather conditions  we may continue to incur operating expenses and build material reserves  temporarily reducing profitability 

table of contents we incur costs as a result of operating as a public company 
our management is required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives 
because we report in us gaap  we may experience delays in closing our books and records in india  and delays in the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures 
as part of a public company with substantial operations  we are experiencing an increase in legal  accounting and other expenses 
in addition  the sarbanes oxley act of and new rules implemented by the sec and the nyse amex have imposed various requirements on public companies  including requiring changes in corporate governance practices 
our management and other personnel need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives 
we have completed the testing of internal controls in all our subsidiaries 
we expect to carry out the evaluations and install improved systems and processes as required 
however  we cannot be certain as to the timing or completion of the remediation actions  or their impact on our operations 
furthermore  it is difficult to hire personnel in india who are familiar with us gaap 
however  we have hired several competent consultants to help review our internal reporting and disclosures  and to train our indian staff in sec reporting and us gaap 
we do not foresee a risk other than the time required to adequately complete the training and to implement the improved processes 
the audit report provided by yoganandh and ram y r will require a review by a us firm 
while our audit firm  yoganandh ram  is registered with the us public company accounting oversight board the pcaob  the sec requires that the audits conducted by yoganandh ram be reviewed by another pcaob registered firm 
if the review identifies changes to an audit  we will be required to amend our annual report as filed on form k incorporating the audited financial statements 
during the year ended march   the pcaob conducted an inspection of yoganandh ram 
one result of the inspection is an expected increase in our auditing expense 
the company has  warrants outstanding  the exercise of which could dilute the number of shares outstanding 
at the time the warrants are exercised  the company will get the exercise price  unless the exercise is cashless 
in either case  such an exercise will also increase the number of shares outstanding 
this may adversely affect the share price as the supply of shares eligible for sale in the public market will increase 
the increased number of shares offered for sale in the public market may exceed the public demand to buy shares at a given market price resulting in the market price adjusting downward 
although we are required to use our best efforts to have an effective registration statement covering the issuance of the shares underlying the public warrants at the time that our warrant holders exercise their public warrants  we cannot guarantee that a registration statement will be declared effective  in which case our warrant holders may not be able to exercise our public warrants and such warrants may expire worthless 
we have issued warrants to purchase our common stock in three public offerings our initial public offering in march  a registered direct offering in september and a public offering in december in the absence of an applicable exemption  holders of warrants issued in our public offerings will be able to exercise the warrants only if a current registration statement under the securities act of relating to the shares of our common stock underlying the warrants is then effective 
although we have undertaken in the respective warrant agreements relating to such warrants  and therefore have a contractual obligation  to use our best efforts to maintain a current registration statement covering the shares underlying the public warrants to the extent required by federal securities laws  and we intend to comply with such undertaking as soon as possible  we do not have such a registration statement currently effective and we cannot assure the warrant holders that we will be able to do so in the future 
we may not be currently eligible to register the warrants on a short form registration on form s which will likely increase the time it will take to obtain an effective registration statement for exercise of the warrants 
if we fail to comply with our contractual obligations we could be liable to the holders of the warrants 
in no event shall we be liable for  or any registered holder of any warrant be entitled to receive  a physical settlement in securities unless the conditions and requirements set forth in the warrant agreement have been satisfied  or b any net cash settlement or other consideration in lieu of physical settlement in securities provided that the holders of the warrants issued in our september and december offerings are entitled to cash payments if we fail to deliver shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants in a timely fashion 
the value of the public warrants may be greatly reduced if a registration statement covering the shares issuable upon the exercise of the warrants is not kept current 
such warrants may even expire worthless 
the warrants issued in our initial public offering that were to expire on march   now expire on march  since we exercised our right to extend the terms of those warrants 
the warrants issued in our september and december offerings expire on september  and december  respectively 
the outstanding warrants issued in our september and december offerings  currently exercisable for an aggregate of  shares of common stock  give the holders of such warrants the right to exercise the warrants on a cashless basis if at the time of exercise there is not an effective registration statement available for the issuance of the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants 
we would not receive any proceeds from the cashless exercise of the warrants 

table of contents with respect to any warrants sold by us in private placements pursuant to an exemption from registration requirements under the federal securities laws  the holders of the warrants sold in such private placements would be able to exercise their warrants even if  at the time of exercise  a prospectus relating to the common stock issuable upon exercise of such warrants is not current 
as a result  the holders of the warrants purchased in the private placements would not have any material restrictions with respect to the exercise of their warrants 
the issuance of certain of securities by us may not have been made in compliance with the federal and state securities laws  which exposes us to potential liabilities  including potential rescission rights 
on july  we filed our form k for the fiscal year ended march  the form k contained audited financial statements included a qualified opinion from our auditors pending completion of their audit procedures in respect of the deconsolidation of one of our subsidiaries 
we subsequently filed an amended form k which includes an unqualified audit opinion 
on january   the securities and exchange commission the commission notified us that the initial financial statements filed on july  did not comply with the requirements of rule under regulation s x for audited financial statements because the financial statements contained a qualified opinion 
as noted above  the amended form k filed on january  contains audited financial statements with an unqualified opinion that comply with rule the commission has indicated that as the initial form k filed on july  was materially deficient as a result of the inclusion of the qualified audit opinion 
it was therefore deemed not to have been filed with the commission in accordance with applicable requirements  thus making us delinquent in its filings with the commission 
the commission has informed us that as a result of the deemed failure to timely file a form k  it is the staff view that as of july  we ceased to be eligible to use sec form s for the registration of the company securities 
as the financial statements included in the original form k were also included in a registration statement on form s file no 
pursuant to which we offered its common stock and warrants to purchase common stock in december the december offering  the commission has also indicated that such registration statement failed to comply with the requirements of form s due to the lack of the inclusion of unqualified audited financial statements in compliance with commission requirements 
since the commission has informed us that it is the commission view that as of july  we ceased to be eligible to use form s for the registration of our securities  it is possible that any sales of our securities pursuant to our registration statements on form s since july  may be deemed to be unregistered sales of its securities 
since july   we have sold an aggregate of  shares of its common stock for an aggregate price of  pursuant to an at the market offering atm of its common stock on form s file no 
in sales that occurred between september  and january  in addition  we may be deemed to have made unregistered sales of the  shares of common stock and warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share sold for an aggregate gross purchase price of  sold pursuant to such registration statement with respect to the december offering 
alternatively  to the extent that the sales are deemed to be registered as a result of being sold pursuant to registration statements declared effective by the commission as the registration statements in question either incorporated  in the case of the form s or included  in the case of the form s  a qualified audit report the registration statements could be deemed to be materially incomplete 
if it is determined that persons who purchased our securities after july  purchased securities in an offering deemed to be unregistered or that the registration statements for such offerings were incomplete or inaccurate  then such persons may be entitled to rescission rights 
in addition  the sale of unregistered securities could subject us to enforcement actions or penalties and fines by federal or state regulatory authorities 
we are unable to predict the likelihood of any claims or actions being brought against us related to these events  and there is a risk that any may have a material adverse effect on us 
to date  we have not received any rescission requests 
if equity research analysts do not publish research or reports about our business  or if they issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our common stock  then the price of our common stock could decline 
the trading market for our common stock will rely in part on the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about our business and us 
we do not control these analysts 
the price of our stock could decline if one or more equity analysts downgrade our stock or if those analysts issue other unfavorable commentary or cease publishing reports about our business or us

if our common stock were removed from listing with the nyse amex  it may be subject to the so called penny stock rules 
the sec has adopted regulations that define a penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price per share of less than  subject to certain exceptions  such as any securities listed on a national securities exchange 
for any transaction involving a penny stock  unless exempt  the rules impose additional sales practice requirements on broker dealers  subject to certain exceptions 
if our common stock were delisted and determined to be a penny stock  a broker dealer may find it more difficult to trade our common stock and an investor may find it more difficult to acquire or dispose of our common stock on the secondary market

background igc  a maryland corporation  was organized on april  as a blank check company formed for the purpose of acquiring one or more businesses with operations primarily in india through a merger  capital stock exchange  asset acquisition or other similar business combination or acquisition 
on march   we completed an initial public offering 
on february   we incorporated india globalization capital  mauritius  limited igc m  a wholly owned subsidiary  under the laws of mauritius 
on march   we consummated the acquisition of of the equity of sricon infrastructure private limited sricon and of the equity of techni bharathi limited tbl 
the shares of the two indian companies  sricon and tbl  are held by igc m 
most of the shares of sricon and tbl acquired by igc were purchased directly from the companies 
igc purchased a portion of the shares from the existing owners of the companies 
the founders and management of sricon own of sricon after giving effect to the deconsolidation described below and the founders and management of tbl own of tbl 
subsequent to the acquisitions  igc borrowed  through an intermediary  approximately million from sricon 
the acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
under this method of accounting  for accounting and financial purposes  igc m  limited was treated as the acquiring entity and sricon and tbl as the acquired entities 
however since no premium was paid for the acquisition of these entities and since these entities had no operations at the time of purchase  there was no goodwill recorded on acquisition relating to these entities 
on february  igc m beneficially purchased of igc mining and trading  limited based in chennai india 
igc imt was formed on december  as a privately held start up company engaged in the business of mining and trading 
its current activity is to operate a shipping hub and to export iron ore to china 
on july  igc m beneficially purchased of igc materials  private limited  and of igc logistics  private limited 
both these companies are based in nagpur  india  which will be involved in the transport and delivery of ore  cement  aggregate and other material 
each of igc imt  igc mpl and igc lpl were formed by third parties at the behest of igc m to facilitate the creation of the subsidiaries  and the purchase price paid for each of igc imt 
igc mpl and igc lpl was equal to the expenses incurred in incorporating the respective entities with no premium paid 
no officer or director of igc had a financial interest in the subsidiaries at the time of their acquisition by igc m 
india globalization capital  inc the registrant  the company  or we and its subsidiaries are significantly engaged in one segment  infrastructure construction 
effective october   we decreased our ownership in sricon infrastructure from to 
as explained in note deconsolidation to the financial statements included herein  on or about march  we consummated the sricon acquisition by purchasing for about million based on an exchange rate of inr for usd 
we subsequently borrowed around million based on inr for usd 
throughout and we expanded our business offerings beyond construction to include a rapidly growing materials business 
we have successfully repositioned the company as a materials and construction company  with construction activity in our tbl subsidiary and materials activity in our other subsidiaries 
rather than continue to owe million  and more importantly  continue to fund two construction companies  we decreased our ownership in sricon from to 
the impact of this is that our corresponding ownership is a non controlling interest 
the deconsolidation of sricon from the balance sheet of igc resulted in reducing the assets on our balance sheet and a one time charge to our income statement

table of contents overview in response to the increased demand for infrastructure in india and china  our focus is to supply construction materials in india and to china as well as execute infrastructure projects 
we do this primarily through our subsidiaries 
we supply construction materials such as iron ore and rock aggregate 
we build interstate highways  rural roads  and execute civil works in high temperature cement and steel plants 
we own and operate rock aggregate quarries 
we are pursuing joint venture partnerships with mine owners and have applied for licenses to mine iron ore in india 
we have customers in india and china and are exploring other regional opportunities 
company overview we are a materials and construction company offering a suite of services including the export of iron ore to china  operations and supply of rock aggregate  and the civil construction of roads and highways

on january  ex minister for road transport and highways  mr 
kamal nath  current india s minister of urban development  told the economic times that he had succeed in building a momentum in india road construction 

by leaving 
more than  km of work in progress and by achieving 
km a day of road construction 
according to the india infrastructure summit  the strong level of economic growth achieved in india in recent years has led to an expansion of industry  commerce and per capita income 
this in turn has fuelled demand for infrastructure services including energy  transportation  telecom  water supply and other urban infrastructure 
this build out of infrastructure in india  we believe  will create a substantial demand for rock aggregate 
in addition  and according to the april steel industry executive summary by the us international trade administration  china s february steel production level increased by to million metric tons from million metric tons in january 
the same source asserts that china s share of total world steel production increased from to between january and february  accounting for nearly half of monthly total world production 
we believe that these trends will continue to be favorable to our business 
our model is as follows we supply iron ore to china and trade in steel in the indian markets 
we supply rock aggregate to the construction industry in india and trade in other construction materials in the indian markets  and we bid and execute construction and engineering contracts 
our expansion plans include building out rock aggregate quarries to create a one stop shop for rock aggregate a business currently not prevalent in india  obtaining licenses for the mining of iron ore in india in order to fill customer orders from china  and winning and executing construction contracts 
there is seasonality in our business as outdoor construction activity slows down during the indian monsoons 
the heavy rains typically continue intermittently from june through september 
industry overview the cia world fact book estimated the indian gdp to be approximately trillion in according to the world bank  only fifteen economies including india  mexico and australia generated more than trillion in gdp in according to the cia world fact book  strong headline gdp growth and quarter on quarter results indicate that the recovery of the indian economy is robust 
backed by strong growth of percent y o y in the first half of fy  the economy is estimated to grow by percent during the fiscal year 
the financial times noted that a recent economic survey of india projected growth at in and in  second only to that of china 

table of contents the factors contributing to maintaining the relatively high growth included growth in the agriculture and service industries  favorable demographic dynamics india has a large youth population that exceeds million  the savings rate  and the spending habits of the indian middle class 
other factors that led to growth include changing investment patterns  increasing consumerism  healthy business confidence  inflows of foreign investment india ranks in the at kearney fdi confidence index for  and improvements in the indian banking system 
to sustain india s fast growing economy  infrastructure investment in india is expected to increase to percent of gdp by  up from percent in this forecast is based on the indian planning commission s statement in its annual publication that for the eleventh plan period  a large investment of approximately billion is required for infrastructure build out and modernization 
this industry is one of the largest employers in the country 
the construction industry alone employs more than million people 
according to the business monitor international bmi  by  the construction industry s contribution to india s gdp is forecasted to be approximately 
this ambitious infrastructure development mandate by the indian government will require funding 
the government of india has already raised funds from multi lateral agencies such as the world bank and the asian development bank 
the india infrastructure company was set up to support projects by guaranteeing up to billion annually 
in addition  the indian government has identified public private partnerships ppp as the cornerstone of its infrastructure development policy 
the indian government is also proactively seeking additional fdi and approval is not required for up to of fdi in most infrastructure areas 
according to indian prime minister  dr 
manmohan singh  india needs trillion in infrastructure spending between fiscal years and the indian government is also permitting external commercial borrowings ecb s as a source of financing indian companies looking to expand existing capacity and incubation for new startups 
ecb s include commercial bank loans  buyers credit  suppliers credit  securitized instruments such as floating rate notes and fixed rate bonds  credit from official export credit agencies  and commercial borrowings from private sector multilateral financial institutions such as the international finance corporation washington  dc  adb  afic  cdc  etc 
national credit policies seek to keep an annual cap or ceiling on access to ecb  consistent with prudent debt management 
these policies encourage a greater emphasis on infrastructure projects in core sectors such as power  oil exploration  telecom  railways  roads and bridges  ports  industrial parks  urban infrastructure  and exporting 
our operations are subject to certain risks and uncertainties  including among others  dependency on the indian and asian economy and government policies  competitively priced raw materials  dependence upon key members of the management team  and increased competition from existing and new entrants 
see the risk factors set forth in item a of this form k for the fiscal year ended march  for a discussion of certain of these risks 
results of operations fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march the following table presents an overview of our results of operations for the fiscal years ended march  and year ended march  as restated change percentage revenues cost of revenues revenues less cost of revenues excluding depreciation selling  general and administrative expenses depreciation operating income loss interest and other financial expenses interest income other income loss on dilution of stake in sricon impairment loss goodwill impairment loss investment equity in earnings of affiliates income before income taxes and minority interest income taxes benefit expense income after income taxes 
table of contents revenue total revenue is million for the year ended march   as compared to million for the year ended march  the primary reasons for the decrease in revenues of million include one of the former subsidiaries of the company sricon was deconsolidated due to a stake sale effective october  the revenue attributable to sricon for the year ended march  was million which constituted revenues for the six months ended september  prior to the deconsolidation which was not recorded in the current year 
decrease in revenue from the infrastructure business amounting to million primarily on account of claims awarded in the previous year which was recorded as revenue 
there were no such claims awarded during the current year 
decrease in revenue from the iron ore and mining businesses amounting to million primarily on account of the ban on export of low grade iron ore to china and closure of ports and mines in karnataka as explained earlier in the risk factors 
this decrease is partially offset by an increase amounting to million on account of the trading business in rock aggregate and other construction materials 
cost of revenue cost of revenue is exclusive of depreciation and amortization 
it consists primarily of compensation and related fringe benefits for project related personnel  department management  and all other dedicated project related costs and indirect costs 
cost of revenue for the year ended march  decreased by million  compared to the year ended march  this decrease is substantially in line with the decrease in revenue as explained above 
cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue has increased from in the previous year to in the current year 
this increase is on account of the significant decline in the iron ore business in the current year 
revenues less cost of expenses the difference between our revenues and cost of revenues decreased by million or to million for the year ended march  as compared to million for the year ended march  the principal reason for the decrease in the same during the year ended march  as compared to the previous year was the reduction in revenue during the year as explained above 
as a percentage of revenue  the difference between revenue and cost of revenue was and for the years ended march  and  respectively 
even though a significant part of the costs associated with revenue also decreased in line with revenue  we had some fixed costs which did not reduce proportionately leading to a decline in our gross profit margin 
selling  general and administrative expenses these consist primarily of employee related expenses  professional fees  other corporate expenses  allocated overhead and provisions and write offs relating to doubtful and bad debts and advances 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended march  compared million for the year ended march  the expenses as a proportion of revenue during the current year were as compared to in the previous year 
the substantial increase in this proportion was primarily due to provision relating to the receivable from one of the investee companies sricon 
one of the subsidiaries of the company tbl had advanced this loan to sricon to fund some of the operations 
however due to certain management disputes  the company the receivable has not been recovered even though the same is due 
the company intends to pursue the collection of this receivable through appropriate legal recourse in india 
however  due to the uncertainty in the timing and the quantum of collection  the company in the current year has provided for this receivable amounting to million 
write off of certain bad debts that were considered to be irrecoverable amounting to million 
excluding the impact of the above write offs  the selling  general and administrative expenses as a proportion of revenue was in the current year as compared to in the previous year 
the increase is due to the fixed overheads incurred for the operations that are not proportionate to the revenue generated 
depreciation the depreciation expense was million in as compared to million in income from operations loss from operations increased from million for the year ended march  to a loss of million for the year ended march   which is an increase of million in losses 

table of contents interest and other financial expense the interest expense for the year ended march  was million as compared to million for the year ended march  for the previous year ended march   interest expense relating to sricon amounting to million was recorded in the books of the company 
as explained earlier  sricon was deconsolidated effective october  and therefore no such interest expense was recorded in the books during the current year 
however  there is a corresponding increase of million in the interest expense primarily due to the modification of the notes payable which were due in the current year 
the company has extended the term of repayment for these notes and the consideration for the modification was settled through the issue of equity shares 
interest income the interest income for the year ended march  was million as compared to million for the year ended march  impairment loss investment during the current year  the company performed an impairment analysis relating to its investment in sricon 
as a background  the company sold a majority part of its stake in sricon effective october  following the sale  the equity interest of the company in sricon was reduced from to 
in the current year  the company has had a dispute with the management of sricon 
igc has therefore moved to a cost basis of accounting for the investment in sricon given the lack of significant influence in the management of sricon despite our stake 
the company conducted an impairment test on the investment based on the information available with it and as a result has provided for million as impairment loss 
impairment loss goodwill the goodwill balance in the books of the company is allocated to the tbl reporting unit 
during the current year  in the fourth quarter  the company performed its annual impairment test on the goodwill balance 
the company assessed the fair value of the reporting unit based on the recoverable values of the assets and the expected settlement values of its liabilities 
based on the impairment analysis  the company has provided for a loss amounting to million relating to the goodwill balance for the year ended march  factors that influence the analysis include contracts  potential contracts  collection of claims  ability to grow the quarry and ore business  and other factors 
while there is an overall liquidity constraint and we require more cash to grow  the market potential for the infrastructure business in india remains strong and unabated 
loss on dilution of stake the charge for the year ended march  included a significant one time charge of million relating to the deconsolidation of sricon 
this charge relating to deconsolidation consists of a one time charge of about million  which represents a portion of the other comprehensive income of sricon that accumulated from the time that igc acquired of sricon 
this also consists of a one time loss of million as a result of decreasing our ownership from to in sricon and extinguishing the loan of million due to sricon 
other income other income primarily consists of foreign exchange gain arising from the restatement of the inter company receivables  denominated in indian rupees  regarding payables to igc 
further during the current year  the company has re recorded liabilities relating to the promoters of tbl amounting to approximately million 
this liability was disputed by the company in the previous year and in the current year  based on an internal assessment  the company has concluded that the same is no longer payable 
income tax expense we had an income tax expense of million for the year ended march  as compared to an income tax benefit of million for the year ended march  the income tax benefit for the previous year was primarily on account of losses incurred in the previous year  which we believed would be offset against taxable profits in the future years due to the execution of the substantial orders received from china 
during the current year  considering the continued ban on import of low grade iron ore by china and the shut down on mining and exports from karnataka  the company believes that the timing of the execution of the orders is not estimable 
therefore  from the perspective of prudence the company has provided a valuation on the entire deferred tax asset balance during the current year resulting in the substantial income tax expense 
we however continue to expect to perform and deliver ore to our customer and earn sufficient taxable income to utilize all the deferred tax assets that we have recorded 
we have not relied on any specific tax planning strategies in the recognition of the deferred tax assets 
net loss the company had a loss of million for the year ended march  as compared to a loss of million for the year ended march this loss was driven primarily by the decision to impair our investment in sricon as well as the goodwill in tbl  the creation of the valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset  and the decline in revenues during the current year 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources this liquidity and capital resources discussion compares the consolidated company results for the years ended march  and we have financed our operations primarily 
from sales of shares of common stock 
we raised about million capital during the year through sale of our common stock 
we raised such capital in the current year primarily for the purpose of funding our working capital requirements and day to day operations 
our operations did not generate sufficient cash during the current fiscal year due to a significant loss in revenues from our iron ore and mining business amounting to million  primarily because of the ban on export of low grade iron ore to china and closure of ports and mines in karnataka india 
income loss on this count is majorly the reason for the net cash used in operating activities as although the though a significant part of the costs associated with revenue also decreased in line with revenue  we had some fixed costs which did not reduce proportionately leading to a decline in our operating profits 
a part of the aforementioned capital raised was also used to repay a portion of the outstanding note to bricoleur approximately  and short term borrowings approximately 
during the year ended march   net cash used for investing activities is not material 
our future liquidity needs will depend on  among other factors  stability of construction costs  interest rates  and a continued increase in infrastructure contracts in india 
we believe that our current cash balances  anticipated operating cash flow  and potential cash from claims are adequate to sustain the company  but not to fuel rapid growth commensurate with the opportunities before us 
we have and continue to take measures to constrain growth until we have visibility into increased liquidity 
as of now our bank lines in india have been reduced to amounts borrowed and outstanding 
we continue to explore funding sources including negotiated settlement of accounts receivable  settlement of claims  bank lines  equity  convertible debentures  and debt 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to access additional credit facilities 
our strategy is to develop businesses that have a very short receivable cycle like the export of ore to china and the sale of rock aggregate and to aggressively collect our outstanding receivables and claims 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any investments in special purpose entities or undisclosed borrowings or debt 
critical accounting policies estimates while preparing financial statements we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses for the reporting period 
such critical accounting estimates could change from period to period and have a material impact on igc s results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
actual results may differ from estimates 
revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which estimates are revised and future periods affected 
revenue we are a materials and construction company offering services including export of iron ore to china quarrying and delivery of rock aggregate  transport and logistics and civil construction of roads and highways  revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of a transaction exists  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
in the case of government contracts  we recognize revenue when a government consultant verifies and certifies an invoice for payment 

table of contents revenue from sale of goods is recognized when substantial risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the buyer under the terms of the contract 
for the sale of goods  the timing of the transfer of substantial risks and rewards of ownership is based on the contract terms negotiated with the buyer  eg  fob or cif 
igc considers the guidance provided under sab in determining revenue from sales of goods 
considerations have been given to all four conditions for revenue recognition under that guidance 
the four conditions are contract persuasive evidence of our arrangement with the customers  delivery based on the terms of the contracts  we assess whether the underlying goods have been delivered and therefore the risks and rewards of ownership are completely transferred  fixed or determinable price we enter into contracts where the price for the goods being sold is fixed and not contingent upon other factors 
collection is deemed probable at the time of recognition of revenue  we make an assessment of our ability to collect the receivable arising on the sale of the goods and determine that collection is probable 
revenue for any sale is recognized only if all of the four conditions set forth above are met 
these criteria are applied by us at the time of each sale 
in any of the criteria set out above is not met  we defer revenue recognition until all of the four conditions are met 
revenue from construction project related activity and contracts for supply commissioning of complex plant and equipment is recognized as follows cost plus contracts contract revenue is determined by adding the aggregate cost plus proportionate margin as agreed with the customer and expected to be realized 
fixed price contracts contract revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion method and the percentage of completion is determined as a proportion of cost incurred to date to the total estimated contract cost 
changes in estimates for revenues  costs to complete and profit margins are recognized in the period in which they are reasonably determinable 
appropriate adjustments are made for change orders  disputes  and other factors affecting the contract 
full provision is made for any loss in the period in which it is foreseen 
revenue from service related activities and miscellaneous other contracts are recognized when the service is rendered using the proportionate completion method or completed service contract method 
income taxes deferred income tax is recorded for the difference between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and income tax purposes 
a valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized in future periods 
the measurement of deferred tax assets involves judgment regarding the deductibility of costs not yet subject to taxation and estimates regarding sufficient future taxable income to enable utilization of unused tax loss carry forwards in the applicable tax jurisdictions 
inventories we provide for inventory obsolescence  excess inventory and inventories with carrying values in excess of market values based on our assessment of the future demands  market conditions and our specific inventory management procedures 
if market conditions and actual demands are less favorable than our estimates  additional inventory write downs may be required 
in all cases inventory is carried at the lower of historical cost or market value 

table of contents accounts receivable we make estimates of the collectibility of our accounts receivable by analyzing historical payment patterns  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends 
if the financial condition of a customer deteriorates  additional allowances may be required 
policy for goodwill and impairment goodwill represents the excess cost of an acquisition over the fair value of our share of net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition 
goodwill on acquisition of subsidiaries is disclosed separately 
goodwill is stated at cost less impairment losses incurred  if any 
we adopted the provisions of accounting standards codification asc  intangibles goodwill and others  previously referred to as sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which sets forth the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition 
asc requires that goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets be allocated to the reporting unit level  which we define as each subsidiary 
asc also prohibits the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets upon adoption  but requires that they be tested for impairment at least annually  or more frequently as warranted  at the reporting unit level 
as per asc through  the impairment testing of goodwill is a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired  thus the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test shall be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test  used to measure the amount of impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill 
after a goodwill impairment loss is recognized  the adjusted carrying amount of goodwill shall be its new accounting basis 
subsequent reversal of a previously recognized goodwill impairment loss is prohibited once the measurement of that loss is completed 
in asc 
a reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below the operating segment 
a component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component 
we have determined that igc operates in a single operating segment 
while the ceo reviews the consolidated financial information for the purposes of decisions relating to resource allocation  the cfo  on a need basis  looks at the financial statements of the individual legal entities in india for the limited purpose of consolidation 
given the existence of discrete financial statements at an individual entity level in india  we believe that each of these entities constitute a separate reporting unit 
therefore  the first step in the impairment testing for goodwill is the identification of reporting units and the allocation of goodwill to these reporting units 
accordingly  tbl which is one of the legal entities  is also considered to be a separate reporting unit and therefore we believe that the assessment of goodwill impairment at the subsidiary level which is also a reporting unit is appropriate 
our analysis of fair value is based on the estimate of the recoverable value of the underlying assets 
for long lived assets such as land  we obtain appraisals from independent professional appraisers to determine the recoverable value 
for other assets such as receivables  the recoverable value is determined based on an assessment of the collectability and any potential losses due to default by the counter parties 
unlike goodwill  long lived assets are assessed for impairment only where there are any specific indicators for impairment 
our methodology for conducting the impairment test has remained substantially the same as compared to the method that we used in the previous year 
the impairment loss for the current year is primarily due to the fact that the revenues of tbl have not been able to match the projections that we had in the previous year and therefore  the projected cash flows that contribute to an assessment of value in use has been minimal 

table of contents impairment of investment the impairment analysis test is done based on a similar recoverable approach as used in the impairment test for goodwill described above 
the fair value of land is determined based on an independent appraisal of the land held by sricon 
the recoverability of contract claims and other receivables is based on the information available with us with respect to the contract claims awarded in favor of sricon through arbitration orders 
the estimated amount of liability is based on the information available with us with respect of bank debt and other borrowings 
impairment of long lived assets the company reviews its long lived assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be fully recoverable 
the company is also vigilant in monitoring for any indicators of impairment and ensures that this is done on an on going basis 
under us gaap  long lived depreciable and amortizable assets are tested for impairment in asset groups unless an individual asset generates identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows from other asset groups 
an asset group is the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that largely are independent of the net cash flows of other groups of assets 
at igc  the impairment testing is done at the entity subsidiary level since there are no individual assets or asset groups generating identifiable cash flows at any level below the entity level 
while computing the fair values for calculation of impairment  for long lived assets such as land  the company obtains independent professional appraisals of the market value of the asset 
in the case of other long lived assets  the company assesses the fair value based on discounted cash flows of the projected cash flows from each of the assets 
successive impairment tests carried out in the past indicate that the fair value at the entity level exceeds the book carrying value 
recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued an amendment to the accounting standards related to the disclosures about an entity use of fair value measurements 
under these amendments  entities will be required to provide enhanced disclosures about transfers into and out of the level fair value determined based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities and level fair value determined based on significant other observable inputs classifications  provide separate disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements relating to the tabular reconciliation of beginning and ending balances of the level fair value determined based on significant unobservable inputs classification and provide greater disaggregation for each class of assets and liabilities that use fair value measurements 
except for the detailed level roll forward disclosures  the new standard was effective for the company for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  the adoption of this accounting standards amendment did not have a material impact on the company disclosure or consolidated financial results 
the requirement to provide detailed disclosures about the purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the roll forward activity for level fair value measurements is effective for the company for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  the adoption of this accounting standard did not have a material impact on the company disclosure or consolidated financial results 
in december  the fasb issued a new accounting standard which requires that step of the goodwill impairment test be performed for reporting units whose carrying value is zero or negative 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those years 
our adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the company disclosure or consolidated financial results 
in december  the fasb issued new guidance clarifying some of the disclosure requirements related to business combinations that are material on an individual or aggregate basis 
specifically  the guidance states that  if comparative financial statements are presented  the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination s that occurred during the current year occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only 
additionally  the new standard expands the supplemental pro forma disclosure required by the authoritative guidance to include a description of the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings 
this guidance became effective january  our adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the company disclosure or consolidated financial results 
however  it may result in additional disclosures in the event that we enter into a business combination that is material either on an individual or aggregate basis 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s the primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks 
market risk is the sensitivity of income to changes in interest rates  foreign exchanges  commodity prices  equity prices  and other market driven rates or prices 
the disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses  but rather  indicators of reasonably possible losses 
this forward looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures 
customer risk the company s customers are the indian government  state government  private companies  indian government owned companies and chinese steel mills and iron ore traders 
therefore  our business requires that we continue to maintain a pre qualified status with our clients so we are not disqualified from bidding on future work 
the loss of a significant client may have an adverse effect on the company 
disqualification can occur if  for example  we run out of capital to finish contracts that we have undertaken 
commodity prices and vendor risk the company is affected by the availability  cost and quality of raw materials including cement  asphalt  steel  rock aggregate  iron ore and fuel 
the prices and supply of raw materials and fuel depend on factors beyond the control of the company  including general economic conditions  competition  production levels  transportation costs and import duties 
the company typically builds contingencies into the contracts  including indexing key commodity prices into escalation clauses 
however  drastic changes in the global markets for raw materials and fuels could affect our vendors  which may create disruptions in delivery schedules that could affect our ability to execute contracts in a timely manner 
we are taking steps to mitigate some of this risk by attempting to control the supply and quality of raw materials 
we do not currently hedge commodity prices on capital markets 
labor risk the building boom in india and the middle east india  pakistan  and bangladesh export labor to the middle east had created pressure on the availability of skilled labor like welders  equipment operators  etc 
this has recently changed with the shortage of financial liquidity and falling oil prices 
however  with the expected increase in infrastructure spending  we expect a shortage of skilled labor 
compliance  legal and operational risks we operate under regulatory and legal obligations imposed by the indian government and us securities regulators 
those obligations relate  among other things  to the company s financial reporting  trading activities  capital requirements and the supervision of its employees 
for example  we file our financial statements in three countries under three different generally accepted accounting standards  gaap 
failure to fulfill legal or regulatory obligations can lead to fines  censure or disqualification of management and or staff and other measures that could have negative consequences for our activities and financial performance 
we are mitigating this risk by hiring local consultants and staff who can manage the compliance in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
however  the cost of compliance in various jurisdictions could have a negative impact on our future earnings 
interest rate risk the infrastructure development industry is one in which leverage plays a large role 
a typical contract requires that we furnish an earnest money deposit  a performance guaranty  and the ability to discount letters of credit 
furthermore  most construction contracts demand that we reserve between seven and eleven percent of contract value in the form of bank guaranties and or deposits 
finally  as interest rates rise  our cost of capital increases thus impacting our margins 

table of contents exchange rate sensitivity our indian subsidiaries conduct all business in indian rupees with the exception of foreign equipment that is purchased from the us or europe 
exchange rates have an insignificant impact on our financial results 
however  as we convert from indian rupees to usd and subsequently report in us dollars  we may see an impact on translated revenue and earnings 
essentially  a stronger usd decreases our reported earnings and a weakening usd increases our reported earnings 
in the analysis below  we have compared the reported revenue and expense numbers for fiscal with the fiscal based on the average exchange rate used for fiscal to highlight the impact of exchange rate changes on igc s indian rupee derived revenues and expenses 
year ended march  current exchange rate previous year exchange rate change percentage revenues total expenses before taxes foreign currency translation igc mainly operates in india and a substantial portion of the company s sales are denominated in the indian rupee 
as a result  changes in the relative values of the us dollar and indian rupee affect revenues and profits as the results are translated into us dollars in the consolidated and pro forma financial statements 
the accompanying financial statements are reported in us dollars 
the indian rupee is the functional currency for the company 
the translation of the functional currencies into us dollars is performed for assets and liabilities using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenues  costs and expenses using average exchange rates prevailing during the reporting periods 
adjustments resulting from the translation of functional currency financial statements to reporting currency are accumulated and reported as other comprehensive income loss  a separate component of shareholders equity 
the exchange rates used for translation purposes are as under year month end average rate p l rate year end rate balance sheet rate inr per usd inr per usd inr per usd inr per usd inr per usd inr per usd inr per usd inr per usd inr per usd inr per usd
