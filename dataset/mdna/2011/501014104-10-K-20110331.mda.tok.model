item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion of the company s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere herein 
results of operations the following table sets forth operating metrics for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended january  year ended january  january  february  change in same store sales on premises sales only company stores domestic franchise stores international franchise stores international franchise stores  in constant dollars change in same store customer count company stores retail sales only n a n a off premises metrics company stores only average weekly number of doors served grocers mass merchants    convenience stores    average weekly sales per door grocers mass merchants convenience stores systemwide sales in thousands company stores    domestic franchise stores   international franchise stores   international franchise stores  in constant dollars average weekly sales per store in thousands company stores factory stores commissaries off premises dual channel stores on premises off premises total on premises only stores all factory stores satellite stores all stores domestic franchise stores factory stores satellite stores international franchise stores factory stores satellite stores represents the change in international franchise same store sales computed by reconverting franchise store sales in each foreign currency to us dollars at a constant rate of exchange for each period 
excludes sales among company and franchise stores 
represents international franchise store sales computed by reconverting international franchise store sales for the year ended january  and february  to us dollars based upon the weighted average of the exchange rates prevailing in the year ended january  includes sales between company and franchise stores 
metrics for the year ended january  include only stores open at january  and metrics for the year ended january  and february  include only stores open at january  the change in same store sales is computed by dividing the aggregate on premises sales including fundraising sales during the current year period for all stores which had been open for more than consecutive weeks during the current year but only to the extent such sales occurred in the th or later week of each store s operation by the aggregate on premises sales of such stores for the comparable weeks in the preceding year 
once a store has been open for at least consecutive weeks  its sales are included in the computation of same store sales for all subsequent periods 
in the event a store is closed temporarily for example  for remodeling and has no sales during one or more weeks  such store s sales for the comparable weeks during the earlier or subsequent period are excluded from the same store sales computation 
the change in same store customer count is similarly computed  but is based upon the number of retail transactions reported in the company s point of sale system 
for off premises sales  average weekly number of doors represents the average number of customer locations to which product deliveries were made during a week  and average weekly sales per door represents the average weekly sales to each such location 
systemwide sales  a non gaap financial measure  include sales by both company and franchise stores 
the company believes systemwide sales data are useful in assessing the overall performance of the krispy kreme brand and  ultimately  the performance of the company 
the company s consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein include sales by company stores  sales to franchisees by the kk supply chain business segment  and royalties and fees received from franchise stores based on their sales  but exclude sales by franchise stores to their customers

excluding the company s revenues related to the refranchised stores in both periods  total revenues rose in the year ended january  a reconciliation of total revenues as reported to adjusted total revenues exclusive of the effects of refranchising follows year ended january  january  in thousands total revenues as reported   sales by refranchised stores  royalties from refranchised stores kk supply chain sales to refranchised stores  adjusted total revenues exclusive of the effects of refranchising   the company believes that adjusted total revenues exclusive of the effects of refranchising  a non gaap measure  is a useful measure because it enables comparisons of the company s revenues that are unaffected by the company s decisions to sell operating krispy kreme stores to franchisees instead of continuing to operate the stores as company locations 
in addition  this comparison is one of the performance metrics adopted by the compensation committee of the company s board of directors to determine the amount of incentive compensation potentially payable to the company s executive officers for fiscal consolidated operating income increased to million in the year ended january  from million in the year ended january  consolidated net income was million in the year ended january  compared to a net loss of  in the year ended january  revenues by business segment expressed in dollars and as a percentage of total revenues are set forth in the table below percentage amounts may not add to totals due to rounding

a reconciliation of company stores segment sales from fiscal to fiscal follows on premises off premises total in thousands sales for the year ended january    fiscal sales at refranchised stores   fiscal sales at closed stores    fiscal sales at closed stores increase in sales at mature stores open stores only  increase in sales at stores opened in fiscal  sales at stores opened in fiscal   sales for the year ended january    sales at company stores decreased in fiscal from fiscal due to store closings and refranchisings  partially offset by an increase in sales from existing stores and stores opened in fiscal and excluding the effects of refranchising  company stores sales increased 
the following table presents sales metrics for company stores year ended january  january  on premises change in same store sales change in same store customer count retail sales only n a off premises grocers mass merchants change in average weekly number of doors change in average weekly sales per door convenience stores change in average weekly number of doors change in average weekly sales per door on premises sales same store sales at company stores rose in fiscal over fiscal  of which the company estimates approximately percentage points is attributable to price increases 
additionally  the same store sales increase in fiscal reflects increased customer traffic partially offset by a decrease in the average guest check 
the company is implementing programs intended to improve on premises sales  including increased focus on local store marketing efforts  improved employee training  store refurbishment efforts and the introduction of new products 
off premises sales off premises sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the company s sales increase was slightly greater than that of the doughnut industry as a whole  according to industry data 
sales to grocers and mass merchants increased to million  with a increase in average weekly sales per door and a increase in the average number of doors served 
the company believes that average weekly sales per door in the grocer mass merchant channel have grown as a result of  among other things  improved customer service  introduction of additional price points  and a redesign of product packaging to improve its shelf appeal 
convenience store sales fell due to both a decline in the average number of doors served and in the average weekly sales per door 
among other reasons  sales to convenience stores declined in fiscal as a result of two large customers implementing in house doughnut programs in fiscal to replace the company s products  the loss of doors associated with those two customers  each of which had relatively h igh average sales per door  accounted for approximately percentage points of the decline in the average number of convenience store doors served for the year ended january  the company is implementing strategies designed to improve sales through convenience stores  including offering additional price points and increasing the quantity and assortment of packaged products offered in this channel 
in addition  the company is seeking to shift customers in the convenience store channel to sales agreements which provide that the company will absorb unsold product rather than the retailer 
while this strategy will increase the cost of product returns  the company believes that increase will be more than offset by higher unit pricing and  because the company will have much greater control over product assortment and quantities merchandised  increased unit sales from both existing products and packaged products not traditionally offered through convenience stores 
the company started implementing price increases for some products offered in the off premises channel late in the first quarter of fiscal  and substantially completed implementing the price increases in the second quarter 
those price increases affect products comprising approximately of off premises sales 
the average price increase on those products was approximately 
declines in the average weekly sales per door adversely affect profitability because of the increased significance of delivery costs in relation to sales 
the company continues to implement steps intended to increase sales  increase average per door sales and reduce costs in the off premises channel 
these steps include improved route management and route consolidation including elimination of or reduction in the number of stops at relatively low volume doors  new sales incentives and performance based pay programs  increased emphasis on relatively longer shelf life products and the development of order management systems to more closely match merchandised quantities and assortments with consumer demand 
costs and expenses cost of sales as a percentage of revenues rose by percentage points from fiscal to of revenues in fiscal  principally reflecting an increase in the cost of food  beverage and packaging 
the cost of sugar rose approximately from fiscal as a result of price increases implemented by kk supply chain to reflect the expiration of a favorable sugar supply contract 
in addition  the cost of shortening and other ingredients also rose year over year 
while on premises and off premises price increases approximated the amount of the cost increases  the substantially equal revenue and cost increases resulted in higher material costs measured as a percentage of revenues 
in addition to higher ingredient costs  an increase in product returns in the off premises channel also increased product costs as a percentage of revenues 
prices of agricultural commodities have been volatile in recent years  and that volatility continued in fiscal notwithstanding that volatility  the trend in the company s costs for doughnut mix  shortening and sugar has been upward in recent years 
in particular  the company s cost of sugar has been dramatically higher in fiscal as a result of the expiration earlier this year of a favorable kk supply chain sugar supply contract 
in the third quarter of fiscal  kk supply chain extended its sugar supply contract  supplies under which are expected to be exhausted in the second quarter of fiscal  such extension is expected to cover the company s sugar requirements for the balance of fiscal and approximately half of the estimated requirements for fiscal the extension is expected to increase the company stores segment s cost of sugar by approximately million in the second half of fiscal the cost increase under the contract in fiscal is less than the increase in the second half of fiscal because the contract price declines in fiscal compared to fiscal in addition to an increase in the cost of sugar  the company currently anticipates significant increases in the cost of doughnut mix  shortening and other ingredients in fiscal as a result of higher commodity prices 
the company estimates that cost increases for packaging and ingredients other than sugar in fiscal will be approximately million 
with the exception of sugar  the company has not yet fixed the prices of a significant percentage of its raw materials and ingredients for the third and fourth quarters of fiscal and  accordingly  further changes in the prices of commodities may cause the company s estimate of fiscal ingredient cost increases to chan ge 
the company is implementing price increases in both the on premises and off premises distribution channels in order to mitigate these cost increases  and is also pursuing other means to mitigate these increases  including changes to its production methods and processes 
because the effects of price increases on sales volumes cannot reliably be predicted or measured  the price increases the company has instituted may not be sufficient to recover higher ingredient costs 
employee benefits as a percentage of revenues declined by percentage points from fiscal to of revenues fiscal  principally due to lower store incentive provisions in fiscal compared to the prior year 
vehicle costs as a percentage of revenues rose from of revenues in to of revenues in fiscal  principally as a result of higher rental expense on leased delivery trucks as a result of the company replacing a portion of its aging delivery fleet 
fuel costs were also higher in fiscal these increases were partially offset by a decrease in repairs and maintenance expense in fiscal favorable adjustments to self insurance reserves for vehicle liability claims in fiscal were approximately  higher than in fiscal  as described below 
the company is self insured for workers compensation  automobile and general liability claims  but maintains stop loss coverage for individual claims exceeding certain amounts 
the company provides for claims under these self insured programs using actuarial methods as described in note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein  and updates actuarial valuations of its self insurance reserves at least annually 
such periodic actuarial valuations result in changes over time in the estimated amounts which ultimately will be paid for claims under these programs to reflect the company s actual claims experience for each policy year as well as trends in claims experience over multiple years 
such claims  particularly workers compensation claims  often are paid over a number of years following the year in which the i nsured events occur  and the estimated ultimate cost of each year s claims accordingly is adjusted over time as additional information becomes available 
the company recorded favorable adjustments to its self insurance claims liabilities related to prior years of approximately million in fiscal  of which million was recorded in the fourth quarter  and million in  of which million was recorded in the fourth quarter 
of the million in favorable adjustments recorded in fiscal  million relates to workers compensation liability claims and is included in employee benefits in the table above   relates to vehicle liability claims and is included in vehicle costs in the table above  and  relates to general liability claims and is included in other operating expenses 
of the million in favorable adjustments recorded in fiscal  million relates to workers compensation liability claims   relates to vehicle liability cla ims and  relates to general liability claims 
during fiscal  the company stores segment recorded charges totaling million of which  was recorded in the fourth quarter for the settlement of environmental and wage hour litigation 
the company is implementing programs intended to improve store operations and reduce costs as a percentage of revenues  including improved employee training and the introduction of food and labor cost management tools 
other segment operating costs as a percentage of revenues rose by percentage points from fiscal to of revenues in fiscal reflecting  among other things  increased spending on marketing costs not charged to stores and off premises selling and support expenses 
additionally  beginning in fiscal  the company began allocating to the business segments the legal fees and expenses directly related to their businesses  such costs were included in general and administrative expenses in prior years 
such fees and expenses totaled approximately  in the company stores segment for the year ended january  and are included in other segment operating costs 
the company stores segment closed or refranchised a total of stores since the end of fiscal  none of which have been accounted for as discontinued operations because the company continues to have significant continuing involvement in the markets in which the stores were or are located  through either continuing operations of other stores in or serving the market  or through its role as a franchisor 
in order to assist readers in understanding the results of operations of the company s ongoing stores  the following table presents the components of revenues and expenses for stores operated by the company as of january   and excludes the revenues and expenses for stores closed and refranchised prior to that date

domestic franchise same store sales rose fiscal domestic franchise operating expenses include costs to recruit new domestic franchisees  to assist in domestic store openings  and to monitor and aid in the performance of domestic franchise stores  as well as allocated corporate costs 
domestic franchise operating expenses rose in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to an increase in legal fees and expenses directly related to the domestic franchise segment 
beginning in fiscal  the company began allocating to the business segments the legal fees and expenses directly related to their businesses  such costs were included in general and administrative expenses in prior years 
such fees and expenses totaled approximately  in the domestic franchise segment for fiscal  the majority of which represented legal costs relating to the company s termination of the franchise agre ements of one of its domestic franchisees 
the increase was partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense in fiscal compared to fiscal bad debt expense was approximately  in fiscal  compared to a net credit of  in fiscal resulting principally from recoveries of accounts previously written off 
a net credit in bad debt expense should not be expected to recur frequently 
additionally  during fiscal  the company recorded charges of approximately  to the domestic franchise segment for the settlement of certain litigation 
domestic franchisees opened seven stores and closed four stores in fiscal royalty revenues are directly related to sales by franchise stores and  accordingly  the success of franchisees operations has a direct effect on the company s revenues  results of operations and cash flows 
international franchise year ended january  january  in thousands revenues royalties   development and franchise fees   total revenues   operating expenses segment operating expenses   depreciation expense allocated corporate overhead   total operating expenses   segment operating income   international franchise royalties increased  driven by an increase in sales by international franchise stores from million in fiscal to million in fiscal changes in the rates of exchange between the us dollar and the foreign currencies in which the company s international franchisees do business increased sales by international franchisees measured in us dollars by approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal  which positively affected international royalty revenues by approximately  in fiscal compared to fiscal the company did not recognize as revenue approximately million and  of uncollected royalties which accrued during fiscal and fiscal  respectively  because the company did not believe collection of these royalties was reasonably assured 
substantially all of the unrecognized royalties in fiscal related t o the company s australian franchisee  which went through a voluntary administration process similar to a bankruptcy filing in the us in october and november in connection with that process  the franchisee closed of the shops the franchisee operated prior to the reorganization 
international franchise same store sales  measured on a constant currency basis to remove the effects of changing exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar constant dollar same store sales  fell 
the decline in international franchise same store sales reflects  among other things  waning honeymoon effects from the large number of new stores opened internationally in recent years and the cannibalization effects on initial stores in new markets of additional store openings in those markets 
honeymoon effect means the common pattern for many start up restaurants in which a flurry of activity due to start up publicity and natural curiosity is followed by a decline during which a steady repeat customer base develops 
cannibalization effect means the tendency for new stores to become successful  in part or in whole  by stealing sales from existing stores in the same market 
constant dollar same store sales in established markets fell in fiscal and fell in new markets 
established markets means countries in which the first krispy kreme store opened before fiscal sales at stores in established markets comprised approximately of aggregate constant dollar same store sales 
while the company considers countries in which krispy kreme has operated for at least six years to be established markets  franchisees in those markets continue to develop their business  these franchisees opened of the international stores opened in the last six fiscal years 
international franchise operating expenses include costs to recruit new international franchisees  to assist in international store openings  and to monitor and aid in the performance of international franchise stores  as well as allocated corporate costs 
international franchise operating expenses declined in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to a decrease in the bad debt provision to a net credit of approximately  in fiscal compared to an expense of  in fiscal the credit in fiscal resulted principally from recoveries of accounts previously written off 
a net credit in bad debt expense should not be expected to recur frequently 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in resources devoted to the development and support of franchisees outside the united states and to higher incentive compensation pro visions 
beginning in fiscal  the company began allocating to the business segments the legal fees and expenses directly related to their businesses  such costs were included in general and administrative expenses in prior years 
such fees and expenses totaled approximately  in the international franchise segment for international franchisees opened stores and closed stores in fiscal royalty revenues are directly related to sales by franchise stores and  accordingly  the success of franchisees operations has a direct effect on the company s revenues  results of operations and cash flows 
kk supply chain the components of kk supply chain revenues and expenses expressed in dollars and as a percentage of total revenues before intersegment sales elimination are set forth in the table below percentage amounts may not add to totals due to rounding 
percentage of total revenues before intersegment sales elimination year ended year ended january  january  january  january  in thousands revenues doughnut mixes   other ingredients  packaging and supplies  equipment   fuel surcharge total revenues before intersegment sales elimination operating expenses cost of sales cost of goods produced and purchased  gain loss on agricultural derivatives inbound freight   total cost of sales   distribution costs outbound freight   other distribution costs   total distribution costs   other segment operating costs   depreciation expense allocated corporate overhead   total operating costs   segment operating income   kk supply chain revenues before intersegment sales elimination increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase reflects selling price increases for sugar and certain other ingredients instituted by kk supply chain in order to pass along to company and franchise stores increases in kk supply chain s cost of sugar  flour and shortening 
the increase also reflects higher unit volumes of most product categories compared to last year resulting from higher sales by domestic and international franchise stores 
the company utilizes a fuel surcharge program to recoup additional freight costs resulting from increases in fuel costs 
charges under the program are based upon the price of diesel fuel  with the price benchmark reset each fiscal year 
an increasing percentage of franchise store sales is attributable to sales by franchisees outside north america 
many of the ingredients and supplies used by international franchisees are acquired locally instead of from kk supply chain 
accordingly  kk supply chain revenues are less correlated with sales by international franchisees than with sales by domestic franchisees 
the decrease in cost of goods produced and purchased as a percentage of sales in fiscal compared to fiscal reflects  among other things  an increase in the percentage of doughnut mix sales composed of mix concentrates  which carry higher profit margins than sales of finished doughnut mixes 
mix concentrates have higher profit margins than finished doughnut mixes because the company attempts to maintain the gross profit on sales of mix concentrates and on finished mixes relatively constant when measured on a finished mix equivalent basis 
distribution costs as a percentage of total revenues fell in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of freight cost reductions resulting from contracting with a third party manufacturer to produce doughnut mix for stores in the western united states 
other segment operating costs include segment management  purchasing  customer service and support  laboratory and quality control costs  and research and development expenses 
these costs also include a charge of  in fiscal compared to a net credit in bad debt expense of approximately  in fiscal the net credit in fiscal principally reflected sustained improved payment performance and or reduced credit exposure with respect to a small number of franchisees 
a net credit in bad debt expense should not be expected to recur frequently 
franchisees opened stores and closed stores in fiscal a substantial portion of kk supply chain s revenues are directly related to sales by franchise stores and  accordingly  the success of franchisees operations has a direct effect on the company s revenues  results of operations and cash flows 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million  or of total revenues  in fiscal compared to million  or of total revenues  in fiscal general and administrative expenses decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal  reflecting the allocation to the segments of legal fees and expenses directly related to their operations that were included in general and administrative expenses prior to fiscal such legal fees and expenses allocated to the segments totaled approximately million in fiscal general and administrative expenses for fiscal included professional fees and expenses of approximately million related to the settlement in late fiscal of certain environmental litigation 
general and administrative expenses in fiscal also reflect one time credits of approximately million representing recoveries of costs incurred in prior periods in connection with certain securities and shareholder derivative litigation settled in october of  of which million was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal general and administrative expenses in fiscal also include approximately million of incentive compensation provisions to reflect fiscal results with an additional charge of approximately million included in direct operating expenses 
in fiscal  general and administrative expenses include approximately million of incentive compensation provisions to reflect fiscal results with an additional charge of approximately million included in direct operating expenses 
impairment charges and lease termination costs impairment charges and lease termination costs were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the components of these charges are set forth in the following table year ended january  january  in thousands impairment charges impairment of long lived assets current period charges impairment of long lived assets adjustments to previously recorded estimates impairment of reacquired franchise rights recovery from bankruptcy estate of former subsidiary total impairment charges   lease termination costs  impairment charges relate principally to company stores 
the company tests long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
these events and changes in circumstances include store closing and refranchising decisions  the effects of changing costs on current results of operations  observed trends in operating results  and evidence of changed circumstances observed as a part of periodic reforecasts of future operating results and as part of the company s annual budgeting process 
impairment charges relate to stores expected to be closed or refranchised  as well as to stores management believes will not generate sufficient future cash flows to enable the company to recover the carrying value of the stores assets  but which management has not yet decided to close 
when the company concludes that the carrying value of long li ved assets is not recoverable based on future projected undiscounted cash flows  the company records impairment charges to reduce the carrying value of those assets to their estimated fair values 
the fair values of these assets are estimated based on the present value of estimated future cash flows  on independent appraisals and  in the case of any assets the company is negotiating to sell  based on the company s negotiations with unrelated third party buyers 
impairment charges for fiscal reflect a one time recovery of  from the bankruptcy estate of freedom rings  llc  a former subsidiary of the company which filed for bankruptcy in fiscal  as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
lease termination costs represent the estimated fair value of liabilities related to unexpired leases  after reduction by the amount of accrued rent expense  if any  related to the leases  and are recorded when the lease contracts are terminated or  if earlier  the date on which the company ceases use of the leased property 
the fair value of these liabilities were estimated as the excess  if any  of the contractual payments required under the unexpired leases over the current market lease rates for the properties  discounted at a credit adjusted risk free rate over the remaining term of the leases 
in fiscal  the company recorded lease termination charges of  representing a change in estimated sublease rentals on stores previously closed and charges related to two store closures and a store relocation  partially offset by the reversal of previously recorded accrued rent related to those stores 
in fi scal  the company recorded lease termination charges of million related principally to the termination of two leases having rental rates substantially above the current market levels 
the company intends to refranchise certain geographic markets  expected to consist principally of  but not necessarily limited to  markets outside the company s traditional base in the southeastern united states 
the franchise rights and other assets in many of these markets were acquired by the company in business combinations in prior years 
in fiscal  the company refranchised three operating company stores to a new franchisee  as more fully described under recent accounting pronouncements in note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein  and a fourth operating store to an existing franchisee 
no gain or loss was recorded on the former transaction  while the second transaction resulted in an asset impairment charge of  as well as receipt of cash proceeds of million from the sale of the store 
the company cannot predict the likelihood of refranchising any additional stores or markets or the amount of proceeds  if any  which might be received therefrom  including the amounts which might be realized from the sale of store assets and the execution of any related franchise agreeme nts 
refranchising could result in the recognition of additional impairment losses on the related assets 
interest income interest income increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal primarily as a result of interest accrued on the note receivable arising from the refranchising of three company stores in northern california 
interest expense the components of interest expense are as follows year ended january  january  in thousands interest accruing on outstanding indebtedness  letter of credit and unused revolver fees   fees associated with credit agreement amendments write off of deferred financing costs associated with credit agreement amendments amortization of deferred financing costs mark to market adjustments on interest rate derivatives amortization of unrealized losses on interest rate derivatives other the decrease in interest accruing on outstanding indebtedness principally reflects the reduction of principal outstanding under the company s term loan 
the resulting reduction in interest expense was partially offset by the effects of higher lender margin and fees resulting from amendments to the company s secured credit facilities in april the april amendments to the credit facilities increased the interest rate on the company s outstanding borrowings and letters of credit by basis points annually 
the interest rate derivative contracts which gave rise to the mark to market adjustments and the amortization of unrealized losses on interest rate derivatives expired in april on january   the company refinanced its secured credit facilities as described under liquidity and capital resources below and in note to the consolidated financial statements appear ing elsewhere herein 
this refinancing is expected to result in a significant decrease in interest expense in fiscal compared to fiscal loss on refinancing of debt during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company closed the secured credit facilities described below under liquidity and capital resources cash flows from financing activities and used the proceeds to retire other indebtedness  as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
the company recorded a loss on the refinancing of approximately million  consisting of an  write off of unamortized deferred financing costs related to the retired debt and  related to other expenses 
equity in income losses of equity method franchisees the company recorded equity in the earnings of equity method franchisees of  in fiscal compared to losses of  in fiscal this caption represents the company s share of operating results of equity method franchisees which develop and operate krispy kreme stores 
the improvement in the results of operations of the equity method franchisees reflects a significant improvement in the results of operations of kk mexico  which has  with the assistance and support of the company  implemented a number of measures designed to improve its operations and reduce costs 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes was million and  in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
each of these amounts includes  among other things  adjustments to the valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets to maintain such allowance at an amount sufficient to reduce the company s aggregate net deferred income tax assets to zero  and a provision for income taxes estimated to be payable or refundable currently 
the portion of the income tax provision represented by taxes estimated to be payable currently was approximately million and  in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  the majority of which represents foreign withholding taxes related to royalties and franchise fees paid by international franchisees 
the current income tax provision for fiscal also includes a credit of  representing anticipated federal tax refunds resulting from an additional carryback of net operating losses made possible by the worker  homeownership and business assistance act of the company has maintained a valuation allowance on deferred income tax assets equal to the entire excess of those assets over the company s deferred income tax liabilities since fiscal because of the uncertainty surrounding the realization of those assets 
such valuation allowance totaled million as of january  such uncertainty reflects the substantial cumulative losses incurred by the company since fiscal however  the company earned a cumulative pretax profit of million during the three most recent fiscal years  including a pretax profit of million in fiscal if the company again generates significant core earnings generally meaning pretax earnings adjusted for non recurring items in fiscal  then  absent other factors indicating a contrary conclusion  it is likely the company will conclude it is appropr iate to reverse a portion of the valuation allowance to earnings in the fourth quarter of fiscal if such a reversal is recorded  it appears unlikely that the reversal will equal the entire million valuation allowance recorded as of january   although it is likely the amount will be material to the company s results of operations 
any reversal will have no effect on the company s cash flows 
while any reversal of a portion of the valuation allowance will have a positive effect on the company s results of operations in the period in which any reversal is recorded  any reversal will most likely have the effect of reducing the company s earnings in subsequent periods as a result of an increase in the provision for income taxes in such periods 
this negative effect on earnings in subsequent periods occurs because the reversal will reflect the recognition of future income tax benefits in the period in which the reversal is recorded  absent the reversal of the valuation allowance  such tax benefits would be recognized in the future periods in which their realization occurs upon the generation of taxable income 
accordingly  subsequent to any reversal of a portion of the valuation allowance  the company s effective income tax rate  w hich currently bears no relationship to pretax income  is likely to more closely reflect the blended federal and state income tax rates to which the company s earnings are subject

sales at company stores decreased in fiscal from fiscal due to store closings and refranchisings 
the increase in on premises sales from stores opened in fiscal was offset by a decline in off premises sales at existing stores 
the following table presents sales metrics for company stores off premises metrics for fiscal excludes data for the four stores in eastern canada refranchised by the company in december year ended january  february  on premises change in same store sales off premises grocers mass merchants change in average weekly number of doors change in average weekly sales per door convenience stores change in average weekly number of doors change in average weekly sales per door on premises sales same store sales at company stores rose in fiscal over fiscal price testing at approximately one third of the company s stores initiated at the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal contributed approximately percentage points to the increase 
in addition  the improvement in same store sales reflects generally lower use of couponing and other price promotions in fiscal  as well as generally lower values of coupons and other price promotions 
off premises sales sales to grocers and mass merchants in fiscal include approximately million of off premises sales of four stores in eastern canada that the company refranchised in december exclusive of the sales of the canadian stores that were refranchised  sales to grocers and mass merchants decreased slightly to million  with the decline in the average number of doors served offset by a increase in the average weekly sales per door 
convenience store sales fell due to both a decline in the average number of doors served and in the average weekly sales per door 
among other reasons  sales to convenience stores have declined as a result of several large customers implementing in house doughnut programs to replace the company s products 
declines in the average weekly sales per door adversely affect profitability because of the increas ed significance of delivery costs in relation to sales 
costs and expenses cost of sales as a percentage of revenues improved by percentage points from fiscal  falling to of revenues in fiscal lower costs for doughnut mix and shortening drove the improvement 
lower costs of flour and shortening resulting from lower agricultural commodity costs enabled kk supply chain to reduce prices on these key items in fiscal while the cost of doughnut mix and other ingredients was relatively stable during fiscal  company stores cost of sugar rose approximately in the fourth quarter as a result of price increases resulting from the expiration of a favorable kk supply chain sugar supply contract 
improved route management and the implementation of performance based pay programs in the off premises channel drove a percentage point decrease in delivery labor as a percentage of off premises sales in fiscal compared to fiscal vehicle costs as a percentage of revenues improved percentage points from of revenues in fiscal to of revenues in fiscal lower fuel prices and improved route management and route consolidation drove the improvement in vehicle costs 
the company is self insured for workers compensation  vehicle and general liability claims  but maintains stop loss coverage for individual claims exceeding certain amounts  as more fully described under fiscal compared to fiscal company stores costs and expenses  above  and in note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
the company recorded favorable adjustments to its self insurance claims liabilities related to prior years of approximately million in fiscal  of which million was recorded in the fourth quarter  and million in fiscal  of which million was recorded in the fourth quarter 
of the million in favorable adjustments recorded in fiscal  million relates to workers compensation liability claims and is included in employee benefits in the table above   relates to vehicle liability claims and is included in vehicle costs  and  relates to general liability claims and is included in other operating expenses

domestic franchise year ended january  february  in thousands revenues royalties   development and franchise fees other total revenues   operating expenses segment operating expenses   depreciation expense allocated corporate overhead total operating expenses   segment operating income   domestic franchise revenues decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  driven by a decline in domestic royalty revenues resulting from a decrease in sales by domestic franchise stores from approximately million in fiscal to million in fiscal domestic franchise same store sales rose in fiscal generally  same store sales at associate franchise stores  which are located principally in the southeast  rose during the year  while same store sales at area developer franchise stores fell 
domestic franchise operating expenses include costs to recruit new domestic franchisees  to assist in domestic store openings  and to monitor and aid in the performance of domestic franchise stores  as well as allocated corporate costs 
domestic franchise operating expenses rose in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to increased resources devoted to the development and support of domestic franchisees  higher incentive compensation provisions of approximately  and an increase in bad debt provisions to approximately  related principally to a single domestic franchisee 
additionally  during fiscal  the company recorded charges of approximately  to the domestic franchise segment for the settlement of certain litigation 
domestic franchisees opened stores and closed seven stores in fiscal royalty revenues are directly related to sales by franchise stores and  accordingly  the success of franchisees operations has a direct effect on the company s revenues  results of operations and cash flows 
international franchise year ended january  february  in thousands revenues royalties   development and franchise fees   other total revenues   operating expenses segment operating expenses   allocated corporate overhead  total operating expenses   segment operating income   international franchise royalties declined  driven by a decrease in sales by international franchise stores from million in fiscal to million in fiscal changes in the rates of exchange between the us dollar and the foreign currencies in which the company s international franchisees do business reduced sales by international franchisees measured in us dollars by approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal  which adversely affected international royalty revenues by approximately  additionally  the company did not recognize as revenue approximately  and  of uncollected royalties which accrued during fiscal and  respectively  because the company did not believe collection of these royalties was reasonably assured 
international franchise same store sales  measured on a constant currency basis to remove the effects of changing exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar  fell 
the decline in international franchise same store sales reflects the large number of new stores opened internationally over the past two years  the cannibalization effects on initial stores in new markets of additional store openings in those markets  and the overall softness in global economic conditions  particularly in more developed markets 
international development and franchise fees decreased  in fiscal due to fewer store openings by international franchisees in fiscal than in fiscal international franchise operating expenses include costs to recruit new international franchisees  to assist in international store openings  and to monitor and aid in the performance of international franchise stores  as well as allocated corporate costs 
international franchise operating expenses rose in the fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to increased resources devoted to the development and support of franchisees outside the united states and to higher incentive compensation provisions of  these increases were partially offset by a decrease in the bad debt provision to  in fiscal compared to million in fiscal international franchisees opened stores and closed stores in fiscal royalty revenues are directly related to sales by franchise stores and  accordingly  the success of franchisees operations has a direct effect on the company s revenues  results of operations and cash flows 
kk supply chain the components of kk supply chain revenues and expenses expressed in dollars and as a percentage of total revenues before intersegment sales elimination are set forth in the table below percentage amounts may not add to totals due to rounding 
percentage of total revenues before intersegment sales elimination year ended year ended january  february  january  february in thousands revenues doughnut mixes   other ingredients  packaging and supplies   equipment   fuel surcharge  total revenues before intersegment sales elimination operating expenses cost of sales cost of goods produced and purchased  gain on agricultural derivatives inbound freight   total cost of sales   distribution costs outbound freight   other distribution costs   total distribution costs   other segment operating costs   depreciation expense  allocated corporate overhead   total operating costs   segment operating income   kk supply chain revenues before intersegment sales elimination fell million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease reflects lower unit sales of doughnut mixes  ingredients and supplies by kk supply chain resulting from lower sales by company and domestic franchise stores 
the decline also reflects selling price reductions for doughnut mixes and certain other ingredients instituted by kk supply chain in fiscal in order to pass along to company and franchise stores reductions in kk supply chain s cost of flour and shortening 
finally  in fiscal  the company utilized a fuel surcharge program to recoup additional freight costs resulting from increased fuel costs 
charges under the program were based upon the price of diesel fuel  the price benchmark was reset in fiscal and no fuel surcharges were made under the program in fiscal an increasing percentage of franchise store sales is attributable to sales by franchisees outside north america 
many of the ingredients and supplies used by international franchisees are acquired locally instead of from kk supply chain 
accordingly  kk supply chain revenues are less correlated with sales by international franchisees than with sales by domestic franchisees 
cost of sales as a percentage of revenues fell in fiscal compared to fiscal the most significant reason for the decrease was the reduced selling price of doughnut mix in fiscal resulting principally from lower flour costs 
while the selling prices of doughnut mixes in fiscal were lower than in fiscal as a result of lower raw materials costs  overall gross margins widened because the company attempts to maintain the gross profit on sales of doughnut mixes relatively constant on a per unit basis 
lower inbound freight costs reflect a decrease in freight rates resulting from lower fuel prices 
in addition  the company closed its california distribution center in fiscal and engaged an independent contractor to supply company and franchise stores west of the mississippi  the inbound freight cost associated with goods delivered by t he contractor is reflected in the fee paid to the contractor  which is included in other distribution costs 
outbound freight costs fell in fiscal compared to fiscal  reflecting both lower unit sales volumes and reduced costs resulting from lower fuel prices 
in addition  outbound freight in fiscal includes a charge of approximately million approximately of kk supply chain revenues before intersegment sales elimination related to payments made by the company to its former third party freight consolidator which were improperly not remitted to the freight carriers by the freight consolidator 
the actions of the third party freight consolidator  which filed for bankruptcy protection  resulted in a loss to the company which the company has not recovered 
other segment operating costs include segment management  purchasing  customer service and support  and laboratory and quality control costs  as well as research and development expenses 
these costs include a net credit of approximately  for bad debt expense in fiscal and a net credit of approximately  in fiscal the net credits principally reflect sustained improved payment performance and or reduced credit exposure with respect to a small number of franchisees and  in fiscal  a recovery of receivables previously written off 
net credits in bad debt expense should not be expected to occur on a regular basis 
domestic and international franchisees opened stores and closed stores in fiscal the majority of kk supply chain s revenues are directly related to sales by franchise stores and  accordingly  the success of franchisees operations has a direct effect on the company s revenues  results of operations and cash flows 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million  or of total revenues  in fiscal compared to million  or of total revenues  in fiscal general and administrative expenses in fiscal include approximately million of incentive compensation provisions to reflect fiscal results with an additional charge of approximately million included in direct operating expenses  there were no incentive compensation provisions in general and administrative expenses for fiscal general and administrative expenses in fiscal reflect higher legal costs compared to fiscal  including legal fees of approximately million related to the resolved environmental litigation 
general and administrative expenses include professional fees and other costs  together with related insurance recoveries  associated with certain securities litigation and related investigations  including costs arising from the company s obligation to indemnify certain former officers of the company for costs incurred by them in connection with those matters  all of which have been settled 
those costs and expenses were a net credit of approximately million in fiscal and a charge of approximately million in fiscal the net credit in fiscal reflects insurance reimbursements of approximately million of costs incurred in prior periods in connection with such litigation and investigations  of which million was recorded in the fourth quarter 
impairment charges and lease termination costs impairment charges and lease termination costs were million in fiscal compared to  in fiscal year ended january  february  in thousands impairment charges impairment of long lived assets current period charges impairment of reacquired franchise rights recovery from bankruptcy estate of former subsidiary total impairment charges   lease termination costs  the company tests long lived assets for impairment and records lease termination costs as described under fiscal compared to fiscal impairment and lease termination costs  above

in fiscal  changes in estimated sublease rentals on a closed store that was subsequently refranchised and the realization of proceeds on an assignment of another closed store lease resulted in a credit in the lease termination provision 
this credit  along with the reversal of previously recorded accrued rent associated with stores closed  partially offset by charges related to other closed store leases  resulted in a net credit in the provision for lease termination costs in fiscal interest income interest income decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal due to lower short term interest rates and lower average cash balances in fiscal compared to fiscal interest expense the components of interest expense are as follows year ended january  february  in thousands interest accruing on outstanding indebtedness   letter of credit and unused revolver fees   fees associated with credit agreement amendments write off of deferred financing costs associated with credit agreement amendments amortization of deferred financing costs mark to market adjustments on interest rate derivatives amortization of unrealized losses on interest rate derivatives payment to counterparty on interest rate cap derivative other the decrease in interest accruing on outstanding indebtedness reflects the reduction in outstanding principal balance of the company s term loans described in note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
that reduction in interest expense was partially offset by the effects of higher lender margin and fees resulting from amendments to the company s secured credit facilities in april the april amendments to the credit facilities increased the interest rate on the company s outstanding borrowings and letters of credit by basis points annually  and the company incurred fees and costs associated with those amendments and with similar amendments in april  as described in note the interest rate derivative contracts which gave rise to the mark to market adjustments and the amortization of unrealized losses on interest rate derivatives expired in april equity in losses of equity method franchisees equity in losses of equity method franchisees totaled  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal this caption represents the company s share of operating results of equity method franchisees which develop and operate krispy kreme stores

other non operating income and expense in fiscal includes a non cash gain of approximately million relating to the disposition of the company s canadian subsidiary in connection with the refranchising of the company s four stores in eastern canada  substantially all of which represents the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment related to the canadian operations which  prior to the sale of the stores  had been reflected  net of tax  in accumulated other comprehensive income 
in addition  other non operating income and expense in fiscal includes a non cash gain of  on the disposal of an investment in an equity method franchisee  largely offset by a  charge for collectibility risk on a note receivable from another equity method franchisee  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes was  and  in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
each of these amounts includes  among other things  adjustments to the valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets to maintain such allowance at an amount sufficient to reduce the company s aggregate net deferred income tax assets to zero  and a provision for income taxes estimated to be payable or refundable currently 
the portion of the income tax provision represented by taxes estimated to be payable currently was approximately  and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  the majority of which represents foreign withholding taxes related to royalties and franchise fees paid by international franchisees

an increase in kk supply chain revenues and higher royalty revenues resulting from growth in the number of franchisees  as well as higher off premises sales  resulted in a million increase in accounts receivable in fiscal the balance in the change in cash flows from operating activities reflects no rmal fluctuations in working capital 
cash flows from investing activities net cash used for investing activities was approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
cash used for capital expenditures increased to approximately million in fiscal from million in fiscal  reflecting increased store refurbishment efforts in existing stores  the construction of new stores in fiscal and the investment in information technology systems

capital resources  contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements in addition to cash flow generated from operations  the company utilizes other capital resources and financing arrangements to fund its business 
a discussion of these capital resources and financing techniques is included below 
debt the company continuously monitors its funding requirements for general working capital purposes and other financing and investing activities 
in the last three fiscal years  management focused on reducing or eliminating the company s investments in franchisees and the related guarantees of franchisees obligations  reducing outstanding debt  and on restructuring the company s borrowing arrangements to maintain credit availability and lower financing costs to facilitate accomplishing the company s business restructuring initiatives 
the secured credit facilities described above and in note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein are the company s principal source of external financing 
the secured credit facilities contain significant financial covenants 
based on the company s current working capital and the fiscal operating plan  management believes the company can comply with the financial covenants and that the company can meet its projected operating  investing and financing cash requirements 
the operation of the financial covenants described above could limit the amount the company may borrow under the revolver 
in addition  the maximum amount which may be borrowed under the revolver is reduced by the amount of outstanding letters of credit  which totaled approximately million as of january  all of which secure the company s reimbursement obligations to insurers under the company s self insurance arrangements 
the maximum unused borrowing capacity available to the company as of january  was approximately million 
the restrictive covenants did not limit the company s ability to borrow the full million of unused credit under the revolver at that date 
the secured credit facilities also contain customary events of default including without limitation  payment defaults  breaches of representations and warranties  covenant defaults  cross defaults to other indebtedness in excess of million  certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency  judgment defaults in excess of million and the occurrence of a change of control 
leases the company conducts some of its operations from leased facilities and leases certain equipment 
generally  these leases have initial terms of two to years and contain provisions for renewal options of five to years 
in determining whether to enter into a lease for an asset  the company evaluates the nature of the asset and the associated lease terms to determine if leasing is an effective financing tool 
off balance sheet arrangements the company s only off balance sheet arrangements  as defined by item a of sec regulation s k  consist principally of the company s guarantees of indebtedness of certain franchisees  as discussed in notes and to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
contractual cash obligations at january  the company s contractual cash obligations as of january  are as follows payments due in less than more than total amount year years years years in thousands long term debt excluding capital lease obligations  including current maturities    interest payment obligations     capital lease obligations operating lease obligations    purchase obligations    contingent guarantee obligations   other long term obligations  including current portion  reflected on the company s balance sheet self insurance claims  principally worker compensation      k mirror plan liability total      estimated interest payments for variable rate debt are based upon the forward libor interest rate curve as of january  on march   the company paid approximately  to enter into an interest rate derivative contract to hedge the company s exposure to higher interest rates  as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
this payment is not reflected in the table above 
amounts represent of the company s aggregate exposure at january  under loan guarantees related to franchisees in which the company has an ownership interest 
the timing of the potential payment is based upon the maturity of the guaranteed indebtedness 
no demand has been made on the company to perform under any of the guarantees 
the preceding table of contractual cash obligations excludes income tax liabilities of approximately  as of at january  for unrecognized tax benefits due to uncertainty in predicting the timing of any such related payments 
capital requirements in the next five years  the company plans to use cash primarily for the following activities working capital and other general corporate purposes  opening new company stores in selected markets  principally small retail shops  remodeling and relocation of selected older company shops  investing in equipment to support the off premises distribution channel  maintaining and enhancing the kk supply chain manufacturing and distribution capabilities  and investing in systems and technology the company s capital requirements for these activities may be significant 
the amount of these capital requirements will depend on many factors including the company s overall performance  the pace of store expansion and company store remodels and other infrastructure needs 
the amount of capital expenditures may be constrained by the operation of restrictive financial covenants to the company s secured credit facilities 
the company currently estimates that its capital expenditures for fiscal will be in the range of million to million 
the most significant capital expenditures currently planned for fiscal are between five and ten new stores  refurbishments to existing stores  replacement of aging delivery vehicles  refurbishment of the company s corporate headquarters  new point of sale hardware to replace existing hardware that is approaching the end of its useful l ife  new handheld hardware and software to replace existing assets used in distribution to off premises customers that is approaching the end of their useful lives  and ongoing smaller  routine capital expenditures 
the company plans to fund these expenditures principally using cash provided by operations and current cash resources  although the company may choose to lease certain anticipated asset acquisitions 
the landlord of the company s corporate headquarters is obligated to fund the first million of the headquarters refurbishing costs 
inflation the company does not believe that general price inflation has had a material effect on its results of operations in recent years 
however  prices of agricultural commodities and fuel have been volatile in recent years 
those price changes  which have generally trended upward  have had a significant effect on the cost of flour  shortening and sugar  the three most significant ingredients used in the production of the company s products  as well as on the cost of gasoline consumed by the company s off premises delivery fleet 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures  including disclosures of contingencies and uncertainties 
gaap provides the framework from which to make these estimates  assumptions and disclosures 
the company chooses accounting policies within gaap that management believes are appropriate to accurately and fairly report the company s operating results and financial position in a consistent manner 
management regularly assesses these polici es in light of changes in facts and circumstances and discusses the selection of accounting policies and significant accounting judgments with the audit committee of the board of directors 
the company believes that application of the following accounting policies involves judgments and estimates that are among the more significant used in the preparation of the financial statements  and that an understanding of these policies is important to understanding the company s financial condition and results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable arise primarily from royalties earned on sales by the company s franchisees  sales by kk supply chain to our franchisees of equipment  mix and other supplies necessary to operate a krispy kreme store  as well as from off premises sales by company stores to convenience and grocery stores and other customers 
during the three fiscal years in the period ended january   some of the company s franchisees experienced financial difficulties or for other reasons did not comply with the normal payment terms for settlement of amounts due to the company 
the company has recorded provisions for doubtful accounts related to its accounts receivable  including receivables from franchisees  in amounts which management believes are sufficient to provide for losses estimated to be sustained on realization of these receivables 
such est imates inherently involve uncertainties and assessments of the outcome of future events  and changes in facts and circumstances may result in adjustments to the provision for doubtful accounts 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets the financial accounting standards board fasb guidance related to goodwill and other intangible assets addresses the accounting and reporting of goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition 
this guidance requires intangible assets with definite lives to be amortized over their estimated useful lives  while those with indefinite lives and goodwill are not subject to amortization but must be tested annually for impairment  or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate potential impairment 
for intangible assets with indefinite lives  the company performs the annual test for impairment as of december the impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets involves comparing the fair value of such assets with their carrying value  with any excess of carrying value over fair value recorded as an impairment charge 
the goodwill impairment test involves determining the fair values of the reporting units to which goodwill is assigned and comparing those fair values to the reporting units carrying values  including goodwill 
to determine fair value for each reporting unit  the company uses the discounted cash flows that the reporting unit can be expected to generate in the future 
this valuation method requires management to project revenues  operating expenses  working capital investment  capital spending and cash flows for the reporting units over a multi year period  as well as determine th e weighted average cost of capital to be used as a discount rate 
the company also considers the estimated fair values of its reporting units relative to the company s overall market capitalization in connection with its goodwill impairment assessment 
significant management judgment is involved in preparing these estimates 
changes in projections or estimates could significantly change the estimated fair value of reporting units 
in addition  if management uses different assumptions or estimates in the future or if conditions exist in future periods that are different than those anticipated  operating results and the balances of goodwill could be affected by impairment charges 
there were no goodwill impairment charges in fiscal  or as of january   the remaining goodwill had a carrying value of million  all of which was associated with the domestic and international franchise segments  each of which consists of a single reporting unit 
the risk of goodwill impairment woul d increase in the event that the franchise segment operating results were to significantly deteriorate or the overall market capitalization of the company were to decline below the book value of the company s shareholders equity 
asset impairment when an asset group typically a store is identified as underperforming or when a decision is made to abandon an asset group or to close a store  the company makes an assessment of the potential impairment of the related assets 
the assessment is based upon a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets  primarily property and equipment  to the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from those assets 
to estimate cash flows  management projects the net cash flows anticipated from continuing operation of the asset group or store until its closing or abandonment  as well as cash flows  if any  anticipated from disposal of the related assets 
if the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows  the company records an impairment charge in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying value of the assets ov er their estimated fair value 
determining undiscounted cash flows and the fair value of an asset group involves estimating future cash flows  revenues  operating expenses and disposal values 
the projections of these amounts represent management s best estimates at the time of the review 
if different cash flows had been estimated  property and equipment balances and related impairment charges could have been affected 
further  if management uses different assumptions or estimates in the future or if conditions exist in future periods that are different than those anticipated  future operating results could be affected 
in addition  the sale of assets whose carrying value has been reduced by impairment charges could result in the recognition of gains or losses to the extent the sales proceeds realized differ from the reduced carrying amount of the assets 
in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  the company recorded impairment charges related to long lived assets totaling approximately million  million and million  respectively 
additional impairment charges may be necessary in future years 
insurance the company is subject to workers compensation  vehicle and general liability claims 
the company is self insured for the cost of all workers compensation  vehicle and general liability claims up to the amount of stop loss insurance coverage purchased by the company from commercial insurance carriers 
the company maintains accruals for the estimated cost of claims on an undiscounted basis  without regard to the effects of stop loss coverage  using actuarial methods which evaluate known open and incurred but not reported claims and consider historical loss development experience 
in addition  the company records receivables from the insurance carriers for claims amounts estimated to be recovered under the stop loss insurance policies when these amounts are estimable and probable of collection 
the company estimates such stop loss receivables us ing the same actuarial methods used to establish the related claims accruals  and taking into account the amount of risk transferred to the carriers under the stop loss policies 
many estimates and assumptions are involved in estimating future claims  and differences between future events and prior estimates and assumptions could affect future operating results and result in adjustments to these loss accruals and related insurance receivables 
income taxes the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon management s expectation of the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the income tax and financial reporting bases of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized for which payment has been deferred  or expenses which already have been deducted in the company s tax return but which have not yet been recognized as an expense in the consolidated financial statements 
deferred tax assets generally represent tax deductions or credits that will be reflected in future tax returns for which the company has already recorded a tax benefit in its consolidated financial statements 
the company establishes valuation allowances for deferred income tax assets in accordance with gaap  which provides that such valuation allowan ces shall be established unless realization of the income tax benefits is more likely than not 
at january   the company had a valuation allowance against deferred income tax assets of million  representing the total amount of such assets in excess of the company s deferred income tax liabilities 
the company has operated at a cumulative profit over the past three fiscal years  however  substantially all of that profit was earned in fiscal  the most recently completed year 
while the company is encouraged by the million pretax profit earned in fiscal and by the favorable trend in the company s financial results over the past three years  management believes it is appropriate to obtain confirmatory evidence that the improvement in the company s results of operations is sustainable  and that realization of at least some of the deferred income tax assets is more likely than not  before reversing a portion of the valuation allowance to earnings 
the company intends to review its conclusions about the appropriate amount of its deferred income tax asset valuation allowance in light of circumstances existing in future periods 
given the nature of the confirmatory evidence the company seeks  management does not expect to review its conclusions until late in fiscal  at which time the company s fiscal results largely will be known 
if the company again generates significant core earnings generally meaning pretax earnings adjusted for non recurring items in fiscal  then  absent other factors indicating a contrary conclusion  it is likely the company will conclude it is appropriate to reverse a portion of the valuation allowance to earnings in the fourth quarter of fiscal if such a reversal is recorded  it appears unlikely that the reversal will equal the entire million va luation allowance recorded as of january   although it is likely the amount will be material to the company s results of operations 
any reversal will have no effect on the company s cash flows 
while any reversal of a portion of the valuation allowance will have a positive effect on the company s results of operations in the period in which any reversal is recorded  any reversal will most likely have the effect of reducing the company s earnings in subsequent periods as a result of an increase in the provision for income taxes in such periods 
this negative effect on earnings in subsequent periods occurs because the reversal will reflect the recognition of future income tax benefits in the period in which the reversal is recorded  absent the reversal of the valuation allowance  such tax benefits would be recognized in the future periods in which their realization occurs upon the generation of taxable income 
accordingly  subsequent to any reversal of a portion of the valuation allowance  the company s effective income tax rate  w hich currently bears no relationship to pretax income  is likely to more closely reflect the blended federal and state income tax rates to which the company s earnings are subject 
the determination of income tax expense and the related balance sheet accounts  including valuation allowances for deferred income tax assets  requires management to make estimates and assumptions regarding future events  including future operating results and the outcome of tax related contingencies 
if future events are different from those assumed or anticipated  the amount of income tax assets and liabilities  including valuation allowances for deferred income tax assets  could be materially affected 
guarantee liabilities the company has guaranteed a portion of certain loan obligations of certain franchisees in which the company owns an interest 
the company assesses the likelihood of making any payments under the guarantees and records estimated liabilities for anticipated payments when the company believes that an obligation to perform under the guarantees is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
no liabilities for the guarantees were recorded at the time they were issued because the company believed the value of the guarantees was immaterial 
as of january   the company has recorded liabilities of approximately million related to such loan guarantees 
the aggregate outstanding principal balance of loans subject to the company s guarantees was approximately million at that date 
assessing the probability of future guarantee payments i nvolves estimates and assumptions regarding future events  including the future operating results of the franchisees 
if future events are different from those assumed or anticipated  the amounts estimated to be paid pursuant to such guarantees could change  and additional provisions to record such liabilities could be required 
investments in franchisees the company has investments in certain equity method franchisees  the value of which cannot be verified by reference to quoted market prices 
the company s assessment of the realizability of these investments involves assumptions concerning future events  including the future operating results of the franchisees 
if future events are different from those assumed or anticipated by the company  the assessment of realizability of the recorded investments in these entities could change  and impairment provisions related to these investments could be required 
during the years ended january  and february   the company recorded impairment charges of  and  respectively  related to investments in equity method franchisees 
there were no impairment charges related to investments in equity method franchisees in fiscal as of january   the company s investment in equity method franchisees was million 
stock based compensation the company measures and recognizes compensation expense for share based payment awards based on their fair values 
because options granted to employees differ from options on the company s common shares traded in the financial markets  the company cannot determine the fair value of options granted to employees based on observed market prices 
accordingly  the company estimates the fair value of stock options subject only to service conditions using the black scholes option valuation model  which requires inputs including interest rates  expected dividends  volatility measures and employee exercise behavior patterns 
some of the inputs the company uses are not market observable and must be estimated 
the fair value of stock options which contain market conditions as well as service conditions is estimated using monte carlo simulation techniques 
in addition  the company must estimate the number of awards whic h ultimately will vest  and periodically adjusts such estimates to reflect actual vesting events 
use of different estimates and assumptions would produce different option values  which in turn would affect the amount of compensation expense recognized 
the black scholes model is capable of considering the specific features included in the options granted to the company s employees that are subject only to service conditions 
however  there are other models which could be used to estimate their fair value  and techniques other than monte carlo simulation could be used to estimate the value of stock options which are subject to both service and market conditions 
if the company were to use different models  the option values would differ despite using the same inputs 
accordingly  using different assumptions coupled with using different valuation models could have a significant impact on the fair value of employee stock options 
recent accounting pronouncements in the third quarter of fiscal  the company refranchised three stores in northern california to a new franchisee 
the aggregate sales price of the stores assets was approximately million  which was evidenced by a promissory note payable to the company bearing interest at and payable in weekly installments equal to a percentage of the stores retail sales  secured by the all the assets of the three stores 
the company did not report the refranchising as a divestiture of the stores and continued to consolidate the stores financial statements for post acquisition periods because the new franchisee was a variable interest entity of which the company was the primary beneficiary under gaap then existing 
effective february   the first day of fiscal  the company adopted new accounting standards related to the consolidation of variable interest entities require an enterprise to qualitatively assess the determination of the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity vie based on whether the enterprise has the power to direct matters that most significantly impact the activities of the vie and has the obligation to absorb losses of  or the right to receive benefits from  the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie 
under the new accounting standards  the company is no longer the primary beneficiary of the new franchisee  which required the company to deconsolidate the franchisee and recognize a divestiture of the stores 
the cumulative effect of adoption of the new standards has been reflected as a million cr edit to the opening balance of retained earnings as of february  adoption of the standards had no material effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in the first quarter of fiscal  the company adopted new accounting standards with respect to financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on both a recurring and non recurring basis and with respect to nonfinancial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis 
in the first quarter of fiscal  the company adopted new accounting standards with respect to nonrecurring measurements of nonfinancial assets and liabilities 
adoption of these standards had no material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein for additional information regarding fair value measurements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company is exposed to market risk from increases in interest rates on its outstanding debt 
all of the borrowings under the company s secured credit facilities bear interest at variable rates based upon either the prime rate  the fed funds rate or libor 
the interest cost of the company s debt may be affected by changes in these short term interest rates and increases in those rates may adversely affect the company s results of operations 
on march   the company entered into an interest rate derivative contract having an aggregate notional principal amount of million 
the derivative contract entitles the company to receive from the counterparty the excess  if any  of the three month libor rate over for each of the calendar quarters in the period beginning april and ending december the company intends to account for this derivative contract as a cash flow hedge 
as of january   the company had approximately million in borrowings outstanding 
a hypothetical increase of basis points in short term interest rates would result in an approximately  increase in annual interest expense on the company s term debt 
the company has sought to limit its exposure to rising short term interest rates by entering into the derivative contract described above 
the company s credit facilities and the related interest rate derivative are described in note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
currency risk the substantial majority of the company s revenue  expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars 
the company s investment in its franchisee operating in mexico exposes the company to exchange rate risk 
in addition  although royalties from international franchisees are payable to the company in us dollars  those royalties are computed based on local currency sales  and changes in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and the foreign currencies used in the countries in which the international franchisees operate affect the company s royalty revenues 
because royalty revenues are derived from a relatively large number of foreign countries  and royalty revenues are not highly concentrated in a small number of such countries  the company believes that the relatively small size of any currency hedging activities would adversely affect the economics of hedging strate gies and  accordingly  the company historically has not attempted to hedge these exchange rate risks 
for the year ended january   the company s international franchisees had sales of approximately million  and the company s related royalty revenues were approximately million 
a hypothetical change in the average rate of exchange between the us dollar and the currencies in which the company s international franchisees do business would have a corresponding effect on the company s international royalty revenues of approximately million 
commodity price risk the company is exposed to the effects of commodity price fluctuations on the cost of ingredients of its products  of which flour  sugar and shortening are the most significant 
in order to secure adequate supplies of materials and bring greater stability to the cost of ingredients  the company routinely enters into forward purchase contracts and other purchase arrangements with suppliers 
under the forward purchase contracts  the company commits to purchasing agreed upon quantities of ingredients at agreed upon prices at specified future dates 
the outstanding purchase commitment for these commodities at any point in time typically ranges from one month s to two years anticipated requirements  depending on the ingredient 
other purchase arrangements typically are contractual arrangements with vendors for example  with respect to certain bevera ges and ingredients under which the company is not required to purchase any minimum quantity of goods  but must purchase minimum percentages of its requirements for such goods from these vendors with whom it has executed these contracts 
in addition to entering into forward purchase contracts  from time to time the company purchases exchange traded commodity futures contracts  and options on such contracts  for raw materials which are ingredients of its products or which are components of such ingredients  including wheat and soybean oil 
the company typically assigns the futures contract to a supplier in connection with entering into a forward purchase contract for the related ingredient 
the company operates a large fleet of delivery vehicles and is exposed to the effects of changes in gasoline prices 
in fiscal  the company began periodically using futures and options on futures to hedge a portion of its exposure to rising gasoline prices

 although the company utilizes forward purchase contracts and futures contracts and options on such contracts to mitigate the risks related to commodity price fluctuations  such contracts do not fully mitigate price risk 
in addition  the portion of the company s anticipated future commodity requirements that are subject to such contracts vary from time to time 
adverse changes in commodity prices could adversely affect the company s profitability and liquidity
