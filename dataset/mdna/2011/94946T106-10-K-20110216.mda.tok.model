based on the general economic conditions and outlook during  we performed an analysis of the underlying valuation of goodwill at december  upon reviewing the valuation results  we determined that the goodwill associated with our medicare reporting unit was fully impaired 
the impairment to our medicare reporting unit was due to  among other things  the anticipated operating environment resulting from regulatory changes and new health care legislation  and the resulting effects on our future membership trends 
in  we recorded goodwill impairment expense of million 
medical benefits ratio measures medical benefits expense as a percentage of premium revenue  excluding premium taxes 
as a result of the restatement and investigation  we were delayed in filing our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december  the form k 
due to the substantial lapse in time between december  and the date of filing of our form k  we were able to review substantially complete claims information that had become available due to the substantial lapse in time between december  and the date of filing of our form k 
we have determined that the claims information that has become available provides additional evidence about conditions that existed with respect to medical benefits payable at the december  balance sheet date and has been considered in accordance with gaap 
consequently  the amounts we recorded for medical benefits payable and medical benefits expense for the year ended december  were based on actual claims paid 
the difference between our actual claims paid for the period and the amount that would have resulted from using our original actuarially determined estimate is approximately million  or a decrease of in the mbr 
thus  medical benefits expense  medical benefits payable and the mbr for the year ended december  include the effect of using actual claims paid 
as discussed above  due to the delay in filing our form k  we were able to review substantially complete claims information that had become available due to the substantial lapse in time between december  and the date we filed our form k  therefore  the favorable development was reported in instead of as it otherwise would have been 
therefore  our recorded amounts for medical benefits expense and mbr for the year ended december  is approximately million  or  higher than it otherwise would have been if we had filed our form k on time 
sg a expense ratio measures selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of total revenue  excluding premium taxes  and does not include depreciation and amortization expense for purposes of determining the ratio 
days in claims payable dcp measures the average number of days in medical benefits payable based on the average amount of medical benefits expense per calendar day  as calculated in the fourth quarter of each year presented 
the increase in dcp in was largely driven by certain provider settlements and state customer agreements  as well as changes we implemented in our claims processes designed to improve encounter data quality 
the changes in claims processing have added approximately five days to our dcp since june  we expect that our dcp will decrease during the first quarter of  as we work through the impacts of these changes

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with part ii  item selected financial data and our combined and consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this form k 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management s expectations 
factors that could cause such differences include those set forth under part i  item business and part i  item a risk factors  as well as forward looking statements discussed earlier in this form k 
overview executive summary we are committed to operating our business in a manner that serves our key constituents members  providers  government clients and associates while delivering competitive returns for our investors 
we provide managed care services exclusively to government sponsored health care programs  serving approximately million members as of december  we believe that our broad range of experience and exclusive government focus allows us to effectively serve our members  partner with our providers and government clients and efficiently manage our ongoing operations 
our strategic priorities include improving health care quality and access for our members  achieving a competitive cost position and delivering prudent and profitable growth 
for a complete discussion of our progress relating to our strategic business initiatives  see part i  item business business strategy 
general economic and political environment the current economic and political environment is affecting our business and the industry overall in a number of ways  as more fully described throughout this form k 
new governors recently took office in nearly all of our current medicaid markets 
these new administrations may propose and implement significant changes to current medicaid programs in their respective states 
these changes may include moving programs into managed care  such as the abd populations  expanding existing programs to provide coverage to those who are currently uninsured  and reprocurement of existing managed care programs 
state budget shortfalls in many states will be a significant consideration in any changes to existing medicaid programs 
the georgia department of community health is evaluating its medicaid programs beyond july   which may include a re bid of the programs for new contracts effective july  louisiana and texas  states in which we have offered ma plans for several years  are now contemplating new and expanded medicaid managed care programs that would be very complementary to our existing operations and infrastructure 
premium rates and payments the states in which we operate continue to experience fiscal challenges which have led to budget cuts and reductions in medicaid premiums in certain states or rate increases that are below medical cost trends 
in particular  we continue to experience pressure on rates in florida and georgia  two states from which we derive a substantial portion of our revenue 
although premiums are generally contractually payable to us before or during the month in which we are obligated to provide services to our members  we have experienced delays in premium payments from certain states 
in particular  the state of georgia recently passed legislation mandating that payment for medicaid premiums in that state be made in the middle and at the end of the month in which services are provided 
although this legislation becomes effective in june  the state of georgia has already implemented this change 
previously  such payments were made at the beginning of each month 
given the budget shortfalls in many states with which we contract  additional payment delays may occur in the future 

table of contents in  as part of the federal medical assistance percentages fmap  congress temporarily increased federal funding for state medicaid programs 
the policy rationale was to help alleviate states fiscal problems in the face of declining revenues and rising medicaid enrollments due to the economic downturn 
the enhanced fmap was set to expire at the end of the senate and house of representatives have separately passed legislation extending additional enhanced fmap funding through june if the enhanced fmap is not extended beyond june  states may have to reassess the level of benefits provided under their health care programs  reassess eligibility for benefits and or take other actions to address a lower fmap 
health care reform we believe that the new health care reform legislation will bring about significant changes to the american health care system 
for a further discussion of health care reform and its potential impact on our business  see part i  item business health care reform 
in addition  refer to the risks and uncertainties related to health care reform as discusses in part i  item a risk factors future changes in health care law present challenges for our business that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 
business and financial outlook business trends our revenues and medical benefits expenses for fiscal year were lower than in prior periods due to our exit on december  from our ma pffs product and our exit from medicaid programs in certain florida counties during premium revenue from our pffs product represented approximately of our ma reportable operating segment revenue and of our consolidated premium revenue for the fiscal year 
we anticipate that the withdrawal from the pffs product may provide approximately million to million of excess capital in the insurance companies that underwrote this line of business  which we may be able to distribute to our unregulated subsidiaries through dividends 
however  we currently believe we will not have the benefit of these dividends until late and possibly later  if at all 
any dividend of surplus capital of our applicable insurance subsidiaries  including the timing and amount of any dividend  would be subject to a variety of factors  which could materially change the aforementioned timing and amount 
those factors principally include the financial performance of other lines of business that operate in those insurance subsidiaries  approval from regulatory agencies and potential changes in regulatory capital requirements 
during  cms imposed a marketing sanction against us that prohibited us from the marketing of  and enrolling members into  all lines of our medicare business from march until the sanction was released in november of that year 
as a result of the sanction  we were not eligible to receive auto assignment of lis dual eligible beneficiaries into our pdps for january enrollment 
we received auto assignment of such members in subsequent months  although such assignments were at levels well below the level we typically experience in the month of january 
we received rate increases in most of our medicaid markets during the third quarter of  including net increases of approximately to in florida effective september  and to in georgia effective july   that were below our medical cost trends 
hawaii program rate increases  which we believe have improved the stability of the program  also were effective july  new york program rate increases were also implemented during the third quarter of that were effective april  as part of the acts  ma payment benchmarks for were frozen at levels 
this places increased importance on administrative cost improvements and effective medical cost initiatives 
based on the outcome of our pdp bids  which resulted in our plans being below the benchmarks in of the cms regions  up from regions in  we were eligible for auto assignment of lis beneficiaries in those regions for january enrollment 
in addition  we maintained our auto assigned members in eight other cms regions where we bid within a de minimis range of the benchmark 
some hospital contracts are directly tied to state medicaid fee schedules  in which case reimbursement levels may be adjusted up or down  generally on a prospective basis  based on adjustments made by the state to the fee schedule 
we have experienced  and may continue to experience  such adjustments unless such adjustments are mitigated by an increase in premiums  our profitability will be negatively impacted 

table of contents strategic and organizational restructuring in august  we announced a strategic and organizational restructuring with the objective of ensuring administrative efficiency and a competitive cost structure 
the restructuring included a workforce reduction and the elimination of a significant number of open positions resulting from streamlining and improving business processes and operations  including the centralization and consolidation of certain functions 
we also allocated new resources and directed substantial investments to priority areas such as health care quality  compliance  information technology  and business development 
assessment of opportunities to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our administrative processes remains an important discipline for us 
we continue to evaluate our operations in order to achieve our long term target of an administrative expense ratio in the low range 
in addition  as part of our medical cost initiatives  we have implemented provider contracting  case and disease management and pharmacy initiatives 
these medical cost initiatives contributed to the year over year reductions we achieved for our medical benefits ratios 
financial impact of government investigations and litigation for a complete discussion of government investigations and litigation including the associated financial impact  please refer to our selling  general and administrative expense discussion under results of operations below and part iv  item a note commitments and contingencies 
basis of presentation segments reportable operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which discrete financial information is available and evaluated on a regular basis by the chief operating decision maker to determine how resources should be allocated to an individual segment and to assess performance of those segments 
previously  we reported two operating segments  medicaid and medicare  which coincide with our two main business lines 
during the first quarter of  we reassessed our segment reporting practices and made revisions to reflect our current method of managing performance and determining resource allocation  which includes reviewing the results of our pdp operations separately from other medicare products 
accordingly  we now have three reportable segments within our two main business lines medicaid  ma and pdp 
the pffs product that we exited december  is reported within the ma segment 
the prior periods have been revised to reflect this segment presentation 
medicaid medicaid was established to provide medical assistance to low income and disabled persons 
it is state operated and implemented  although it is funded and regulated by both the state and federal governments 
our medicaid segment includes plans for beneficiaries of tanf  ssi  abd and state based programs that are not part of medicaid programs  such as chip and fhp programs for qualifying families that are not eligible for medicaid because they exceed the applicable income thresholds 
tanf generally provides assistance to low income families with children  abd and ssi generally provide assistance to low income aged  blind or disabled individuals 
the medicaid programs and services we offer to our members vary by state and county and are designed to serve our various constituencies effectively in the communities we serve 
although our medicaid contracts determine to a large extent the type and scope of health care services that we arrange for our members  in certain markets we customize our benefits in ways that we believe make our products more attractive 
our medicaid plans provide our members with access to a broad spectrum of medical benefits from many facets of primary care and preventive programs to full hospitalization and tertiary care 
in general  members are required to use our network  except in cases of emergencies  transition of care or when network providers are unavailable to meet their medical needs  and generally must receive a referral from their pcp in order to receive health care from specialists  such as surgeons or neurologists 
members do not pay any premiums  deductibles or co payments for most of our medicaid plans 

table of contents medicare advantage medicare is a federal program that provides eligible persons age and over  and some disabled persons  a variety of hospital  medical and prescription drug benefits 
our ma segment consists of ma plans which  following the exit of our pffs product on december   is comprised of ccps 
ma is medicare s managed care alternative to original medicare  which provides individuals standard medicare benefits directly through cms 
ccps are administered through health maintenance organizations hmos and generally require members to seek health care services and select a pcp from a network of health care providers 
in addition  we offer medicare part d coverage  which provides prescription drug benefits  as a component of our ma plans 
we cover a wide spectrum of medical services through our ma plans  including in some cases  additional benefits not covered by original medicare  such as vision  dental and hearing services 
through these enhanced benefits  the out of pocket expenses incurred by our members are reduced  which allows our members to better manage their health care costs 
most of our ma plans require members to pay a co payment  which varies depending on the services and level of benefits provided 
typically  members of our ma ccps are required to use our network of providers except in cases such as emergencies  transition of care or when specialty providers are unavailable to meet a member s medical needs 
ma ccp members may see out of network specialists if they receive referrals from their pcps and may pay incremental cost sharing 
in most of our markets  we also offer special needs plans to individuals who are dually eligible for medicare and medicaid 
these plans  commonly called d snps  are designed to provide specialized care and support for beneficiaries who are eligible for both medicare and medicaid 
we believe that our d snps are attractive to these beneficiaries due to the enhanced benefit offerings and clinical support programs 
prescription drug plans we offer stand alone medicare part d coverage to medicare eligible beneficiaries through our pdp segment 
the medicare part d prescription drug benefit is supported by risk sharing with the federal government through risk corridors designed to limit the losses and gains of the drug plans and by reinsurance for catastrophic drug costs 
the government subsidy is based on the national weighted average monthly bid for this coverage  adjusted for risk factor payments 
additional subsidies are provided for dual eligible beneficiaries and specified low income beneficiaries 
the medicare part d program offers national in network prescription drug coverage that is subject to limitations in certain circumstances 
depending on medical coverage type  a beneficiary has various options for accessing drug coverage 
beneficiaries enrolled in original medicare can either join a stand alone pdp or forego part d drug coverage 
beneficiaries enrolled in ma ccps can join a plan with part d coverage  select a separate part d plan  or forego part d coverage 
segment financial performance measures we use three measures to assess the performance of our reportable operating segments premium revenue  mbr and gross margin 
our mbr measures the ratio of our medical benefits expense to premiums earned  after excluding medicaid premium taxes 
our gross margin is defined as our premium revenue less our medical benefits expense 
our profitability depends in large part on our ability to  among other things  effectively price our health and prescription drug plans  predict and effectively manage medical benefits expense relative to the primarily fixed premiums we receive  including reserve estimates and pharmacy costs  contract with health care providers  and attract and retain members 
in addition  factors such as regulation  competition and general economic conditions affect our operations and profitability 
the effect of escalating health care costs  as well as any changes in our ability to negotiate competitive rates with our providers may impose further risks to our profitability and may have a material impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
premium revenue we receive premiums from state and federal agencies for the members that are assigned to  or have selected  us to provide health care services under medicaid and medicare 
the primarily fixed premiums we receive for each member varies according to the specific government program 
the premiums we receive under each of our government benefit plans are generally determined at the beginning of the contract period 
these premiums are subject to adjustment throughout the term of the contract  although such adjustments are typically made at the commencement of each new contract period 
for further information regarding premium revenues  please refer below to premium revenue recognition under critical accounting estimates 

table of contents medical benefits expense our largest expense is the cost of medical benefits that we provide  which is based primarily on our arrangements with health care providers and utilization of health care services by our members 
our arrangements with providers primarily fall into two broad categories capitation arrangements  pursuant to which we pay the capitated providers a fixed fee per member and fee for service as well as risk sharing arrangements  pursuant to which the provider assumes a portion of the risk of the cost of the health care provided 
capitation payments represented  and of our total medical benefits expense for the years ended december   and  respectively 
other components of medical benefits expense are variable and require estimation and ongoing cost management 
we use a variety of techniques to manage our medical benefits expense  including payment methods to providers  referral requirements  quality and disease management programs  reinsurance and member co payments and premiums for some of our medicare plans 
national health care costs have been increasing at a higher rate than the general inflation rate  however  relatively small changes in our medical benefits expense relative to premiums that we receive can create significant changes in our financial results 
changes in health care laws  regulations and practices  levels of use of health care services  competitive pressures  hospital costs  major epidemics  terrorism or bio terrorism  new medical technologies and other external factors could reduce our ability to manage our medical benefits expense effectively 
estimation of medical benefits payable and medical benefits expense is our most significant critical accounting estimate 
for further information regarding medical benefits expense  please refer below to estimating medical benefits expense and medical benefits payable under critical accounting estimates 
gross margin and medical benefits ratio our primary tools for measuring profitability are gross margin and mbr 
changes in gross margin and mbr from period to period result from  among other things  changes in medicaid and medicare funding  changes in the mix of medicaid and medicare membership  our ability to manage medical costs and changes in accounting estimates related to ibnr claims 
we use gross margin and mbrs both to monitor our management of medical benefits and medical benefits expense and to make various business decisions  including what health care plans to offer  what geographic areas to enter or exit and which health care providers to select 
although gross margin and mbrs play an important role in our business strategy  we may be willing to enter new geographical markets and or enter into provider arrangements that might produce a less favorable gross margin and mbr if those arrangements  such as capitation or risk sharing  would likely lower our exposure to variability in medical costs or for other reasons 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth data from our consolidated statements of operations  as well as other key data used in our results of operations discussion

the decrease in ma ccp resulted from the cms medicare marketing sanction  which was lifted in november however  we were not eligible to receive auto assignments of low income subsidy  dual eligible beneficiaries into our pdp plans for january enrollment 
we received auto assignments of pdp members in subsequent months  although such assignments were below the level we typically experience in the month of january 
membership in all of our segments has sequentially increased for the last two quarters  which reflects the strengthening throughout of our ma sales processes and auto assignments of additional pdp members and medicaid members  primarily in georgia 
for  we are targeting membership growth for both our ma and pdp segments 
as of january   our ma membership increased by  members to  members and our pdp membership grew by approximately  members 
overall membership declined from december  to december  by  members 
the decline was primarily due to lower pdp membership resulting from the pdp bid in which we were above the benchmark in of regions  partially offset by an increase in medicaid members 

table of contents net loss income for the year ended december   the net loss was million compared to million of net income for the same period in excluding investigation related and litigation resolution costs of million and million  net of tax  net income would have been million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in net income  as adjusted  for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the prior year was mainly the result of the loss of gross margin from the withdrawal of our pffs product and increases in medicare related marketing costs  partially offset by our overall mbr improvement and reductions in sg a expenses 
net income increased approximately million to million in the year ended december  from a net loss of million in excluding investigation related and litigation resolution costs of million and million  net of tax  net income would have been million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively

the decrease in premium revenue is primarily attributable to the decline in membership in our ma segment and lower membership in our pdp segment in the first half of resulting from our loss of membership due to the cms marketing sanction and higher returned premium under the risk corridor provisions of our pdp product  partially offset by an increase in medicaid segment premium revenue due primarily to reductions by certain states that occurred earlier in the year and membership growth 
for the year ended december   total premium revenue  excluding the impact of premium taxes and premium revenue from our pffs product  increased million  or  to  million from  million for the same period in the prior year due to increases in premium rates in both the medicaid and medicare segments 
investment and other income for the year ended december   investment and other income decreased million  or  to million from million for the same period in the prior year 
the decrease was primarily due to reduced market rates on lower average cash and investment balances  partially offset by the increase in other income attributed to shifting our investment portfolio during the third quarter of from tax exempt to taxable investments  which typically generates a higher yield  and from other income derived primarily from co payments collected on member prescriptions and sales of prescription drugs to non members that can vary during any particular period 
for the year ended december   investment and other income decreased approximately million  or  to million from million for the same period in the prior year 
the decrease was primarily due to reduced market rates on lower average investment and cash balances 
medical benefits expense as previously discussed  our ma segment includes results from the pffs product that we exited on december  medical benefits expense for our pffs product was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the wind down of pffs lowered medical benefits expense by approximately million as a result of the favorable development of and prior years medical benefits payable 

table of contents excluding the medical benefits expense from our pffs product  total medical benefits expense for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to  million from  million for the same period in the prior year 
the decrease in medical benefits expense was primarily due to the decline in membership in our other products  as well as a decrease in mbr for medicaid and pdp 
the consolidated mbr  excluding the impact from our pffs product  was and for the year ended december  and  respectively 
net favorable prior period reserve development  excluding pffs  reduced mbr by and in and  respectively 
the decline in mbr is primarily due to improved performance of our medicaid and pdp segments

we currently expect that mbrs for all three of our segments will increase in versus ongoing medical expense management initiatives will be important to our competitive position given the challenging rate environment 
excluding the medical benefits expense from our pffs product  total medical benefits expense for the year ended december  increased million  or  to  million from  million for the same period in the prior year 
our mbr was in both of the years ended december  and we believe that medical benefits expense for the year ended december  should be adjusted to exclude million of favorable claim reserve development recorded in that otherwise would have been recognized in the year ended december  if we had timely filed our form k 
we were able to review substantially complete claims information that had become available due to the substantial lapse in time between december  and the date we filed our form k  therefore  the favorable development was reported in instead of as it otherwise would have been 
the adjusted medical benefit expense amount is a non gaap financial measure 
medical benefits expense for the year ended december   increased million to approximately  million from approximately  million  as adjusted  for the same period in the prior year 
our mbr for the year ended december   was compared to as adjusted for the same period in the increase in medical benefits expense and mbr was primarily due to the change in the demographic mix of our members and overall increased utilization patterns

please refer to part i  item legal proceedings for a complete discussion of investigation related and litigation resolution costs 
we believe it is appropriate to evaluate sg a expense exclusive of these investigation related and litigation resolution costs because they are not believed to be indicative of long term business operations 
a summary of these investigation related resolution costs and a reconciliation of sg a expense  including and excluding such costs  are presented below 
for the year ended december  in millions sg a expense adjustments investigation related and litigation resolution costs investigation related administrative costs  net of d o insurance policy recovery net investigation related and litigation resolution costs adjusted sg a expense reflects costs related to resolving government investigations and related litigation  including the dpa with the usao  inquiries by the sec  inquiries by the civil division and the putative class action complaints

excluding the investigation related and litigation resolution costs  our sg a expense for the year ended december   decreased approximately million  or  to million from million for the same period in the prior year 
the reduction in sg a expense was mainly due to the exit of our pffs product and operating efficiency  offset in part by increased costs for ma ccp marketing and infrastructure investments and severance costs associated with our organizational realignment implemented during 
table of contents our sg a expense as a percentage of total revenue  excluding premium taxes sg a ratio  was for the year ended december  compared to for the same period in the prior year 
after excluding the investigation related and litigation resolution costs  our sg a ratio for the year ended december  was compared to for the same period in the prior year 
the increase in sg a ratio was mainly due to a lower revenue base in resulting from the exit from our pffs product and lower ma ccp marketing costs in due to the cms marketing sanction 
we anticipate that our adjusted sg a ratio will be in the high range 
we believe this represents solid progress toward our long term goal of an adjusted sg a ratio in the low range  based on our current business mix 
business simplification projects  process management in our shared services functions  and continued evaluation of our organizational design will drive further improvement in our administrative cost structure 
excluding the investigation related and litigation resolution costs  our sg a expense for the year ended december   decreased approximately million  or  to million from million for the same period in the reduction in sg a expense was primarily driven by lower sales and marketing costs caused by the cms sanction and reduced florida medicaid sales costs 
the lower sg a expense was partially offset by investments to improve operating efficiency and effectiveness and to remediate issues in conjunction with the cms marketing sanction

after excluding the investigation related and litigation resolution costs  our sg a ratio for the year ended december  was compared to for the same period in medicaid premium taxes certain state agencies place an assessment or tax on medicaid premiums  which is included in the premium rates established in the medicaid contracts with each state agency and recorded as a component of revenue  as well as administrative expense  when incurred 
we exclude medicaid premium taxes from premium revenue when calculating our key ratios as we believe the premium tax is not indicative of our operating performance 
in october  the state of georgia stopped assessing taxes on medicaid premiums remitted to us  which resulted in an equal reduction to premium revenues and expenses 
however  effective july   the state of georgia began assessing premium taxes again on medicaid premiums

our effective income tax rate in both years differed from the statutory tax rate primarily due to limitations on the deductibility of certain administrative expenses associated with the resolution of investigation related matters as well as certain executive compensation costs 
for the year ended december   income tax expense was million on pre tax income compared to million of income tax benefit on pre tax loss for the same period in the tax effective rate was approximately and in the years ended december  and  respectively

the lower premium revenue in is the result of lower membership in the first half of the year and a higher returned premium under the risk corridor provisions of the pdp product 
the higher risk corridor returned premium is due to the lower claim expense in membership increased by approximately  members to  as of december  from  as of december   despite lower membership throughout the first half of the year 
pdp membership at the beginning of was lower than the end of as we were unable to receive auto assigned membership in january following the release of the cms marketing sanction 
membership gradually increased throughout the year as we became eligible to receive auto assignments and additional marketing activities 
pdp mbr improved for the year ended december  due to improved performance of the product as a result of our revised product benefit design and increased generic drug dispensing through the benefit design 
pdp gross margin for the year ended december  increased million to million from million for the same period in the prior year 
the improvement in gross margin was due mainly to better overall performance of the part d product and improved mbr despite the decrease in premiums 
given our low mbr in  we will likely experience an increase in our pdp mbr in this membership growth will result in our pdp segment making up a larger part of our business in versus consequently  the seasonal medical benefits expense pattern of the pdp product will have a more pronounced effect on the aggregate operating results 
during  we also anticipate continued membership growth as a result of auto assignment of low income subsidy members 
in addition  we believe our plans are well positioned relative to member utilization patterns  cost sharing and focus on generic medications  for what is a very value and cost conscious population 
therefore  we anticipate additional voluntary enrollment as well 
for the year ended december   pdp segment premium revenue decreased million to million from  million for the same period in the decrease in pdp segment revenue is primarily due to a loss in pdp membership of approximately  members as we bid above the benchmark in of regions

table of contents liquidity and capital resources overview each of our existing and anticipated sources of cash is impacted by operational and financial risks that influence the overall amount of cash generated and the capital available to us 
for a further discussion of risks that can affect our liquidity  see part i  item a risk factors 
cash generating activities our business consists of operations conducted by our regulated subsidiaries  including hmos and insurance subsidiaries  and our non regulated subsidiaries 
the primary sources of cash for our regulated subsidiaries include premium revenue  investment income and capital contributions made by us to our regulated subsidiaries 
our regulated subsidiaries are each subject to applicable state regulations that  among other things  require the maintenance of minimum levels of capital and surplus 
our regulated subsidiaries primary uses of cash include payment of medical expenses  management fees to our non regulated third party administrator subsidiary the tpa and direct administrative costs  which are not covered by the agreement with the tpa  such as selling expenses and legal costs 
we refer collectively to the cash and investment balances maintained by our regulated subsidiaries as regulated cash and regulated investments  respectively 
the primary sources of cash for our non regulated subsidiaries are management fees and dividends received from our regulated subsidiaries and investment income 
our non regulated subsidiaries primary uses of cash include payment of administrative costs not charged to our regulated subsidiaries for corporate functions  including administrative services related to claims payment  member and provider services and information technology 
other primary uses include capital contributions made by our non regulated subsidiaries to our regulated subsidiaries 
we refer collectively to the cash and investment balances available in our non regulated subsidiaries as unregulated cash and unregulated investments  respectively 
cash positions we currently believe that we will be able to meet our known monetary obligations  including the terms of the settlement agreements reached to resolve the government investigation and related litigation  and maintain sufficient liquidity to operate our business 
however  one or more of our regulators could require one or more of our subsidiaries to maintain minimum levels of statutory net worth in excess of the amount required under the applicable state laws if the regulators were to determine that such a requirement were in the interest of our members 
further  there may be other potential adverse developments that could impede our ability to meet our obligations

on december   three of our regulated subsidiaries  declared dividends to one of our non regulated subsidiaries in the aggregate amount of million  of which two dividends were paid in december and one dividend which was paid in january 
table of contents initiatives to increase our unregulated cash we are pursuing alternatives to raise additional unregulated cash 
some of these initiatives include  but are not limited to  consideration of obtaining dividends from certain of our regulated subsidiaries to the extent that we are able to access any available excess capital and or accessing the debt and equity capital markets 
however  we cannot provide any assurances that we will obtain applicable state regulatory approvals for additional dividends to our non regulated subsidiaries by our regulated subsidiaries or be successful in accessing the capital markets if we determine to do so 
credit facility we entered into a credit agreement on may   which was subsequently amended on may  as amended  the credit agreement 
the credit agreement provides for a million committed revolving credit facility that expires on november  borrowings under the credit agreement may be used for general corporate purposes 
the credit agreement is guaranteed by us and our subsidiaries  other than our hmo and insurance subsidiaries 
in addition  the credit agreement is secured by first priority liens on our personal property and the personal property of our subsidiaries  other than the personal property and equity interests of our hmo and insurance subsidiaries 
borrowings designated by us as alternate base rate borrowings bear interest at a rate per annum equal to i the greatest of a the prime rate as defined in the credit agreement in effect on such day  b the federal funds effective rate as defined in the credit agreement in effect on such day plus of  and c the adjusted libo rate as defined in the credit agreement for a one month interest period on such day plus  plus ii 
borrowings designated by us as eurodollar borrowings bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the adjusted libo rate for the interest period in effect for such borrowing plus 
the credit agreement includes negative covenants that limit certain of our activities  including restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness  and financial covenants that require a minimum ratio of cash flow to total debt  a maximum ratio of total liabilities to consolidated net worth and a minimum level of statutory net worth for our hmo and insurance subsidiaries 
the credit agreement also contains customary representations and warranties that must be accurate in order for us to borrow under the credit agreement 
in addition  the credit agreement contains customary events of default 
if an event of default occurs and is continuing  we may be required to immediately repay all amounts outstanding under the credit agreement  and the commitments under the credit agreement may be terminated 
as of december   the credit facility has not been drawn upon and we remain in compliance with all covenants 
auction rate securities as of december   all of our long term investments were comprised of municipal note investments with an auction reset feature auction rate securities 
these notes are issued by various state and local municipal entities for the purpose of financing student loans  public projects and other activities  which carry investment grade credit ratings 
liquidity for these auction rate securities is typically provided by an auction process which allows holders to sell their notes and resets the applicable interest rate at pre determined intervals  usually every seven   or days 
as of the date of this form k  auctions have failed for million of our auction rate securities and there is no assurance that auctions on the remaining auction rate securities in our investment portfolio will succeed in the future 
an auction failure means that the parties wishing to sell their securities could not be matched with an adequate volume of buyers 
in the event that there is a failed auction the indenture governing the security requires the issuer to pay interest at a contractually defined rate that is generally above market rates for other types of similar instruments 
the securities for which auctions have failed will continue to accrue interest at the contractual rate and be auctioned every seven   or days until the auction succeeds  the issuer calls the securities  or they mature 
as a result  our ability to liquidate and fully recover the carrying value of our remaining auction rate securities in the near term may be limited or non existent 
in addition  while all of our auction rate securities currently carry investment grade ratings  if the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate  we may in the future be required to record an impairment charge on these investments 
although auctions continue to fail  we believe we will be able to liquidate these securities without significant loss  and we currently believe these securities are not impaired  primarily due to government guarantees or municipal bond insurance and our ability and present intent to hold these securities until maturity or market stability is restored  however  it could take until the final maturity of the underlying securities to realize our investments recorded value 
the final maturity of the underlying securities could be as long as years 
the weighted average life of the underlying securities for our auction rate securities portfolio is years 
during  auction rate securities of million  in the aggregate  were called at par  at the option of the issuer 

table of contents investigation related costs we have expended significant financial resources in connection with the investigations and related matters 
since the inception of these investigations through december   we have incurred a total of approximately million for administrative expenses associated with  or consequential to  these governmental and company investigations specifically for legal fees  accounting fees  consulting fees  employee recruitment and retention costs and other similar expenses  prior to any insurance recoveries 
in august  we entered into an agreement and release with the carriers of our d o liability insurance relating to coverage we sought for claims relating to the previously disclosed government investigations and related litigation 
we agreed to accept immediate payment of million  including million received by us in prior years  in satisfaction of the million face amount of the relevant d o insurance policies and the carriers agreed to waive any rights they may have to challenge our coverage under the policies 
the agreement and release did not include a million face amount policy we maintain for non indemnifiable securities claims by directors and officers during the same time period and such policy is not affected by the agreement and release 
accordingly  we recorded the million of insurance proceeds as a reduction to sg a expenses at the time the agreement was executed 
no additional recoveries with respect to such matters are expected under our insurance policies and all expenses incurred by us in the future for these matters will not be further reimbursed by our insurance policies 
we currently maintain directors and officers liability insurance in the amount of million for other matters not addressed above 
regulatory capital and dividend restrictions our operations are conducted primarily through hmo and insurance subsidiaries 
these subsidiaries are licensed by the insurance department in the state in which they operate  except our new york hmo subsidiary  which is licensed as a prepaid health services plan by the new york state department of health  and are subject to the rules  regulation and oversight of the applicable state agencies in the areas of licensing and solvency 
state insurance laws and regulations prescribe accounting practices for determining statutory net income and capital and surplus 
each of our regulated subsidiaries is required to report regularly on its operational and financial performance to the appropriate regulatory agency in the state in which it is licensed 
these reports describe each of our regulated subsidiaries capital structure  ownership  financial condition  certain intercompany transactions and business operations 
from time to time  any of our regulated subsidiaries may be selected to undergo periodic audits  examinations or reviews by the applicable state agency of our operational and financial assertions 
our regulated subsidiaries generally must obtain approval from  or provide notice to  the state in which it is domiciled before entering into certain transactions such as declaring dividends in excess of certain thresholds  entering into other arrangements with related parties  and acquisitions or similar transactions involving an hmo or insurance company  or any change in control 
for purposes of these laws  in general  control commonly is presumed to exist when a person  group of persons or entity  directly or indirectly  owns  controls or holds the power to vote or more of the voting securities of another entity 
each of our hmo and insurance subsidiaries must maintain a minimum amount of statutory capital determined by statute or regulation 
the minimum statutory capital requirements differ by state and are generally based on a percentage of annualized premium revenue  a percentage of annualized health care costs  a percentage of certain liabilities  statutory minimum  rbc requirements or other financial ratios 
the rbc requirements are based on guidelines established by the naic  and have been adopted by most states 
as of december   our hmo operations in connecticut  georgia  illinois  indiana  louisiana  missouri  new jersey  ohio and texas as well as three of our insurance company subsidiaries were subject to rbc requirements 
the rbc requirements may be modified as each state legislature deems appropriate for that state 
the rbc formula  based on asset risk  underwriting risk  credit risk  business risk and other factors  generates the acl  which represents the amount of capital required to support the regulated entity s business 
for states in which the rbc requirements have been adopted  the regulated entity typically must maintain a minimum of the greater of the required acl or the minimum statutory net worth requirement calculated pursuant to pre rbc guidelines 
our subsidiaries operating in texas  georgia and ohio are required to maintain statutory capital at rbc levels equal to  and  respectively  of the applicable acl 
failure to maintain these requirements would trigger regulatory action by the state 
at december   our hmo and insurance subsidiaries were in compliance with these minimum capital requirements 
the combined statutory capital and surplus of our hmo and insurance subsidiaries was approximately million and million at december  and  respectively  compared to the required surplus of approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 

table of contents the statutory framework for our regulated subsidiaries minimum capital changes over time 
for instance  rbc requirements may be adopted by more of the states in which we operate 
these subsidiaries are also subject to their state regulators overall oversight powers 
for example  the state of new york adopted regulations that increased the reserve requirement by over an eight year period that will be fully implemented by in addition  regulators could require our subsidiaries to maintain minimum levels of statutory net worth in excess of the amount required under the applicable state laws if the regulators determine that maintaining such additional statutory net worth is in the best interest of our members and other constituents 
moreover  if we expand our plan offerings in new states or pursue new business opportunities  we may be required to make additional statutory capital contributions 
in addition to the foregoing requirements  our regulated subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability to make dividend payments  loans and other transfers of cash 
dividend restrictions vary by state  but the maximum amount of dividends which can be paid without prior approval from the applicable state is subject to  among other things  restrictions relating to statutory capital  surplus and net income for the previous year 
states may disapprove any dividend that  together with other dividends paid by a subsidiary in the prior twelve months  exceeds the regulatory maximum as computed for the subsidiary based on its statutory surplus and net income 
also  we may only invest in the types of investments allowed by the state in order to qualify as admitted assets and we are required by certain states to deposit or pledge assets that are considered as restricted assets 
at december  and  all of our restricted assets consisted of cash and cash equivalents  money market accounts  certificates of deposits  and us government securities

the preliminary settlement is subject to completion and approval of an executed written settlement agreement and other government approvals  as discussed in part i  item legal proceedings 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded an estimate related to the qui tam relators attorneys fees to be paid in addition to the preliminary settlement amount 
based on the terms of an agreement reached with the lead plaintiffs in december to resolve the class action complaints that is subject to approval by the federal court  as discussed in part i  item legal proceedings 
we are not an obligor under or guarantor of any indebtedness of any other party  however  we may have to pay referral claims of health care providers under contract with us who are not able to pay costs of medical services provided by other providers 

table of contents critical accounting estimates in the ordinary course of business  we make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of our results of operations and financial condition in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that the accounting estimates relating to premium revenue recognition  medical benefits payable and medical benefits expense  and goodwill and intangible assets are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
premium revenue recognition we receive premiums from state and federal agencies for the members that are assigned to  or have selected  us to provide health care services under medicaid and medicare 
the premiums we receive for each member vary according to the specific government program and are generally determined at the beginning of the contract period 
these premiums are subject to adjustment throughout the term of the contract by cms and the states  although such adjustments are typically made at the commencement of each new contract renewal period 
we recognize premium revenues in the period in which we are obligated to provide services to our members 
premiums are billed monthly for coverage in the following month and we are paid generally in the month in which we provide services 
we estimate  on an ongoing basis  the amount of member billings that may not be fully collectible or that will be returned based on historical trends  compliance with requirements for certain contracts to expend a minimum percentage of premiums on eligible medical expense  and other factors 
an allowance is established for the estimated amount that may not be collectible and a liability is established for premium expected to be returned 
historically  the allowance has not been significant relative to premium revenue 
premium payments that we receive are based upon eligibility lists produced by the government 
we verify these lists to determine whether we have been paid for the correct premium category and program 
from time to time  the states or cms requires us to reimburse them for premiums that we received based on an eligibility list that a state  cms or we later discover contains individuals who were not eligible for any government sponsored program or belong to a different plan other than ours 
the verification and subsequent membership changes may result in additional amounts due to us or we may owe premiums back to the government 
the amounts receivable or payable identified by us through reconciliation and verification of agency eligibility lists relate to current and prior periods 
the amounts receivable from government agencies for reconciling items were million and million at december  and  respectively 
the amounts due to government agencies for reconciling items were million and million at december  and  respectively 
we record adjustments to revenues based on member retroactivity 
these adjustments reflect changes in the number and eligibility status of enrollees subsequent to when revenue was billed 
we estimate the amount of outstanding retroactivity adjustments each period and adjust premium revenue accordingly  if appropriate  the estimates of retroactivity adjustments are based on historical trends  premiums billed  the volume of member and contract renewal activity and other information 
changes in member retroactivity adjustment estimates had a minimal impact on premiums recorded during the periods presented 
our government contracts establish monthly rates per member that may be adjusted based on member demographics such as age  working status or medical history 
medicaid our medicaid segment generates revenues primarily from premiums received from the states in which we operate health plans 
we receive a fixed premium pmpm pursuant to our state contracts 
our medicaid contracts with state governments are generally multi year contracts subject to annual renewal provisions 
annual rate changes are recorded when they become effective 
we generally receive premium payments during the month in which we provide services and recognize premium revenue during the period in which we are obligated to provide such services to our members 
in some instances  our base premiums are subject to risk score adjustments based on the acuity of our membership 
generally  the risk score is determined by the state analyzing encounter submissions of processed claims data to determine the acuity of our membership relative to the entire state s medicaid membership 
in georgia  illinois  missouri  new york and ohio  we are eligible to receive supplemental payments for newborns and or obstetric deliveries 
each state contract is specific as to what is required before payments are generated 
upon delivery of a newborn  each state is notified according to the contract 
revenue is recognized in the period that the delivery occurs and the related services are provided to our member 
additionally  in some states  supplemental payments are received for certain services such as high cost drugs and early childhood prevention screenings 
any amounts that have been earned and have not been received from the state by the end of the period are recorded on our balance sheet as premium receivables 
revenues are recorded based on membership and eligibility data provided by the states  which may be adjusted by the states for any subsequent updates to this data 
historically  these eligibility adjustments have been immaterial in relation to total revenue recorded and are reflected in the period known 

table of contents our florida medicaid and healthy kids contracts and illinois medicaid contract require us to expend a minimum percentage of premiums on eligible medical expense  and to the extent that we expend less than the minimum percentage of the premiums on eligible medical expense  we are required to refund all or some portion of the difference between the minimum and our actual allowable medical expense 
we estimate the amounts due to the state as a return of premium each period based on the terms of our contract with the applicable state agency 
medicare advantage the amount of premiums we receive for each ma member is established by contract  although the rates vary according to a combination of factors  including upper payment limits established by cms  the member s geographic location  age  gender  medical history or condition  or the services rendered to the member 
our ma contracts with cms generally have terms of one year and expire at the end of each calendar year 
ma premiums are due monthly and are recognized as revenue during the period in which we are obligated to provide services to members 
prescription drug plans as with our traditional ma plans  we provide written bids to cms for our pdps  which include the estimated costs of providing prescription drug benefits over the plan year 
the payments we receive monthly from cms and members are based on our estimated costs for providing prescription drug insurance coverage 
we recognize premium revenues for providing this insurance coverage ratably over the term of our contract 
our pdp contracts with cms generally has a term of one year 
the amount of cms payments relating to pdp coverage is subject to adjustment  positive or negative  based upon the application of risk corridors that compare our prescription drug costs in our bids to cms to our actual prescription drug costs 
settlement of the risk corridor payment is based on a reconciliation made approximately nine months after the close of each calendar year 
risk adjusted premiums cms employs a risk adjustment model to determine the premium amount it pays for each member 
this model apportions premiums paid to all ma plans according to the health status of each beneficiary enrolled 
as a result  our cms monthly premium payments per member may change materially  either favorably or unfavorably 
the cms risk adjustment model pays more for medicare members with predictably higher costs 
diagnosis data from inpatient and ambulatory treatment settings are used to calculate the risk adjusted premiums we receive 
we collect claims and encounter data and submit the necessary diagnosis data to cms within prescribed deadlines 
after reviewing the respective submissions  cms establishes the premium payments to ma plans generally at the beginning of the calendar year  and then adjusts premium levels on two separate occasions on a retroactive basis 
the first retroactive adjustment for a given fiscal year generally occurs during the third quarter of such fiscal year 
the initial cms settlement represents the updating of risk scores for the current year based on the severity of claims incurred in the prior fiscal year 
cms then issues the final cms settlement 
we reassess the estimates of the initial cms settlement and the final cms settlement each reporting period and any resulting adjustments are made to ma premium revenue 
we develop our estimates for risk adjusted premiums utilizing historical experience and predictive models as sufficient member risk score data becomes available over the course of each cms plan year 
our models are populated with available risk score data on our members 
risk premium adjustments are based on member risk score data from the previous year 
risk score data for members who entered our plans during the current plan year  however  is not available for use in our models  therefore  we make assumptions regarding the risk scores of this subset of our member population 
all such estimated amounts are periodically updated as additional diagnosis code information is reported to cms and adjusted to actual amounts when the ultimate adjustment settlements are either received from cms or we receive notification from cms of such settlement amounts 
as a result of the variability of factors that determine such estimates  including plan risk scores  the actual amount of cms retroactive payment could be materially more or less than our estimates 
consequently  our estimate of our plans risk scores for any period  and any resulting change in our accrual of ma premium revenues related thereto  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
historically  we have not experienced significant differences between the amounts that we have recorded and the revenues that we ultimately receive 
the data provided to cms to determine the risk score is subject to audit by cms even after the annual settlements occur 
these audits may result in the refund of premiums to cms previously received by us 
while our experience to date has not resulted in a material refund  this refund could be significant in the future  which would reduce our premium revenue in the year that cms determines repayment is required 

table of contents cms has performed and continues to perform radv audits of selected ma plans to validate the provider coding practices under the risk adjustment model used to calculate the premium paid for each ma member 
our florida ma plan was selected by cms for audit for the contract year and we anticipate that cms will conduct additional audits of other plans and contract years on an ongoing basis 
the cms audit process selects a sample of enrollees for medical record review from each contract selected 
we have responded to cms s audit requests by retrieving and submitting all available medical records and provider attestations to substantiate cms sampled diagnosis codes 
cms will use this documentation to calculate a payment error rate for our florida ma plan premiums 
cms has not indicated a schedule for processing or otherwise responding to our submissions 
cms has indicated that payment adjustments resulting from its radv audits will not be limited to risk scores for the specific beneficiaries for which errors are found  but will be extrapolated to the relevant plan population 
in late december  cms issued a draft audit sampling and payment error calculation methodology that it proposes to use in conducting these audits 
cms invited public comment on the proposed audit methodology and announced in early february that it will revise its proposed approach based on the comments received 
cms has not given a specific timetable for issuing a final version of the audit sampling and payment error calculation methodology 
given that the radv audit methodology is new and is subject to modification  there is substantial uncertainty as to how it will be applied to ma organizations like our florida ma plan 
at this time  we do not know whether cms will require retroactive or subsequent payment adjustments to be made using an audit methodology that may not compare the coding of our providers to the coding of original medicare and other ma plan providers  or whether any of our other plans will be randomly selected or targeted for a similar audit by cms 
we are also unable to determine whether any conclusions that cms may make  based on the audit of our plan and others  will cause us to change our revenue estimation process 
because of this lack of clarity from cms  we are unable to estimate with any reasonable confidence a coding or payment error rate or predict the impact of extrapolating an applicable error rate to our florida ma plan premiums 
however  it is likely that a payment adjustment will occur as a result of these audits  and that any such adjustment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position  and cash flows  possibly in and beyond 
estimating medical benefits expense and medical benefits payable the cost of medical benefits is recognized in the period in which services are provided and includes an estimate of the cost of ibnr medical benefits 
medical benefits payable has two main components direct medical expenses and medically related administrative costs 
direct medical expenses include amounts paid or payable to hospitals  physicians and providers of ancillary services  such as laboratories and pharmacies 
medically related administrative costs include items such as case and disease management  utilization review services  quality assurance and on call nurses  which are recorded in selling  general  and administrative expense 
medical benefits payable on our consolidated balance sheets represents amounts for claims fully adjudicated awaiting payment disbursement and estimates for ibnr 
the following table provides a reconciliation of the total medical benefits payable balances as of december   and as of december  of total of total of total dollars in millions claims adjudicated  but not yet paid ibnr total medical benefits payable the medical benefits payable estimate has been and continues to be our most significant estimate included in our financial statements 
we historically have used and continue to use a consistent methodology for estimating our medical benefits expense and medical benefits payable 
our policy is to record management s best estimate of medical benefits payable based on the experience and information available to us at the time 
this estimate is determined utilizing standard actuarial methodologies based upon historical experience and key assumptions consisting of trend factors and completion factors using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions  which vary by business segment 
these standard actuarial methodologies include using  among other factors  contractual requirements  historic utilization trends  the interval between the date services are rendered and the date claims are paid  denied claims activity  disputed claims activity  benefits changes  expected health care cost inflation  seasonality patterns  maturity of lines of business and changes in membership 

table of contents the factors and assumptions described above that are used to develop our estimate of medical benefits expense and medical benefits payable inherently are subject to greater variability when there is more limited experience or information available to us 
the ultimate claims payment amounts  patterns and trends for new products and geographic areas cannot be precisely predicted at their onset  since we  the providers and the members do not have experience in these products or geographic areas 
standard accepted actuarial methodologies  discussed above  would allow for this inherent variability 
this can result in larger differences between the originally estimated medical benefits payable and the actual claims amounts paid 
conversely  during periods where our products and geographies are more stable and mature  we have more reliable claims payment patterns and trend experience 
with more reliable data  we should be able to more closely estimate the ultimate claims payment amounts  therefore  we may experience smaller differences between our original estimate of medical benefits payable and the actual claim amounts paid 
in developing our estimates  we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated 
for the more recent months  which constitute the majority of the amount of the medical benefits payable  we estimate claims incurred by applying observed trend factors to the fixed fee pmpm costs for prior months  which costs have been estimated using completion factors  in order to estimate the pmpm costs for the most recent months 
we validate our estimates of the most recent pmpm costs by comparing the most recent months utilization levels to the utilization levels in prior months and actuarial techniques that incorporate a historical analysis of claim payments  including trends in cost of care provided and timeliness of submission and processing of claims 
many aspects of the managed care business are not predictable 
these aspects include the incidences of illness or disease state such as congestive heart failure cases  cases of upper respiratory illness  the length and severity of the flu season  diabetes  the number of full term versus premature births and the number of neonatal intensive care babies 
therefore  we must continually monitor our historical experience in determining our trend assumptions to reflect the ever changing mix  needs and size of our membership 
among the factors considered by management are changes in the level of benefits provided to members  seasonal variations in utilization  identified industry trends and changes in provider reimbursement arrangements  including changes in the percentage of reimbursements made on a capitation as opposed to a fee for service basis 
these considerations are reflected in the trends in our medical benefits expense 
other external factors such as government mandated benefits or other regulatory changes  catastrophes and epidemics may impact medical cost trends 
other internal factors such as system conversions and claims processing interruptions may impact our ability to accurately predict estimates of historical completion factors or medical cost trends 
medical cost trends potentially are more volatile than other segments of the economy 
management uses considerable judgment in determining medical benefits expense trends and other actuarial model inputs 
we believe that the amount of medical benefits payable as of december  is adequate to cover our ultimate liability for unpaid claims as of that date  however  actual payments may differ from established estimates 
if the completion factors we used in estimating our ibnr for the year ended december  were decreased by  our net loss would increase by approximately million 
if the completion factors were increased by  our net loss would decrease by approximately million 
we record reserves for estimated referral claims related to health care providers under contract with us who are financially troubled or insolvent and who may not be able to honor their obligations for the costs of medical services provided by other providers 
in these instances  we may be required to honor these obligations for legal or business reasons 
based on our current assessment of providers under contract with us  such losses have not been and are not expected to be significant 
changes in medical benefits payable estimates are primarily the result of obtaining more complete claims information and medical expense trend data over time 
volatility in members needs for medical services  provider claims submissions and our payment processes result in identifiable patterns emerging several months after the causes of deviations from assumed trends occur 
since our estimates are based upon pmpm claims experience  changes cannot typically be explained by any single factor  but are the result of a number of interrelated variables  all influencing the resulting medical cost trend 
differences in our financial statements between actual experience and estimates used to establish the liability  which we refer to as prior period developments  are recorded in the period when such differences become known  and have the effect of increasing or decreasing the reported medical benefits expense and resulting mbr in such periods 

table of contents in establishing our estimate of reserves for ibnr at each reporting period  we use standard actuarial methodologies based upon historical experience and key assumptions consisting of trend factors and completion factors  which vary by business segment  to determine an estimate of the base reserve 
actuarial standards of practice require that a margin for uncertainty be considered in determining the estimate for unpaid claim liabilities 
if a margin is included  the claim liabilities should be adequate under moderately adverse conditions 
therefore  we make an additional estimate in the process of establishing the ibnr  which also uses standard actuarial techniques  to account for adverse conditions that may cause actual claims to be higher than estimated compared to the base reserve  for which the model is not intended to account 
we refer to this additional liability as the provision for moderately adverse conditions 
the provision for moderately adverse conditions is a component of our overall determination of the adequacy of our ibnr reserve 
the provision for moderately adverse conditions is intended to capture the potential adverse development from factors such as our entry into new geographical markets  our provision of services to new populations such as the aged  blind and disabled  the variations in utilization of benefits and increasing medical cost  changes in provider reimbursement arrangements  variations in claims processing speed and patterns  claims payment  the severity of claims  and outbreaks of disease such as the flu 
because of the complexity of our business  the number of states in which we operate  and the need to account for different health care benefit packages among those states  we make an overall assessment of ibnr after considering the base actuarial model reserves and the provision for moderately adverse conditions 
we consistently apply our ibnr estimation methodology from period to period 
we review our overall estimates of ibnr on a monthly basis 
as additional information becomes known to us  we adjust our assumptions accordingly to change our estimate of ibnr 
therefore  if moderately adverse conditions do not occur  evidenced by more complete claims information in the following period  then our prior period estimates will be revised downward  resulting in favorable development 
however  any favorable prior period reserve development would affect increase current period net income only to the extent that the current period provision for moderately adverse conditions is less than the benefit recognized from the prior period favorable development 
if moderately adverse conditions occur and are more than we estimated  then our prior period estimates will be revised upward  resulting in unfavorable development  which would decrease current period net income 
in addition to the release of the provision for moderately adverse conditions  medical benefits expense for the year ended december   was impacted by approximately million of net favorable development related to prior years 
for the year ended december   medical benefits expense was impacted by approximately million of net favorable development related to prior years 
a significant portion of the net favorable prior year development in is associated with the exit of our pffs product on december  the net amount of prior period developments in the periods was primarily attributable to pricing assumptions  early durational effect favorability  the volatility associated with our new and small blocks of ma business  which were converted from the loss ratio methodology to the development factor methodology in both methodologies are recognized methods for estimating claim reserves in accordance with actuarial standards of practice  the recovery by us of claim overpayments on our pffs product that exceeded our estimates and better than expected demographic mix of membership 
the factors impacting the changes in the determination of medical benefits payable discussed above were not discernable in advance 
the impact became clearer over time as claim payments were processed and more complete claims information was obtained 
medical benefits payable includes reserves for claims adjudicated  but not yet paid  an estimate of claims incurred but not reported  reserves for medically related administrative costs and other liabilities  including estimates for provider settlements due to clarification of contract terms  out of network reimbursement  claims payment differences and amounts due to contracted providers under risk sharing arrangements 
the following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of medical benefits payable for the following periods year ended december  in millions balances as of beginning of period medical benefits incurred related to current period prior periods total medical benefits paid related to current period prior periods total balances as of end of period changes in medical benefits payable estimates are primarily the result of obtaining more complete claims information and medical expense trend data over time 
differences in our financial statements between actual experience and estimates used to establish the liability  which we refer to as prior period developments  are recorded in the period when such differences become known  and have the effect of increasing or decreasing the reported medical benefits expense and resulting mbr in such periods 

table of contents medical benefits payable recorded at december   and developed favorably by approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
these prior period developments were primarily attributable to the release of the provision for moderately adverse conditions  which is included as part of the assumptions  and favorable variances between actual experience and key assumptions relating to trend factors and completion factors for claims incurred in prior years 
the release of the provision for moderately adverse conditions was substantially offset by the provision for moderately adverse conditions established for claims incurred in the succeeding year 
accordingly  the change in the amount of the incurred claims related to prior years in the medical benefits payable does not directly correspond to an increase in net income recognized during the period 
we consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate of the ultimate medical benefits payable within a level of confidence  as required by actuarial standards of practice  which require that the medical benefits payable be adequate under moderately adverse conditions 
as we establish the liability for each year  we ensure that our assumptions appropriately consider moderately adverse conditions 
when a portion of the development related to the prior year incurred claims is offset by an increase determined appropriate to address moderately adverse conditions for the current year incurred claims  we do not consider that offset amount as having any impact on net income during the period 
goodwill and intangible assets we obtained goodwill and intangible assets as a result of the acquisitions of our subsidiaries 
goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired 
intangible assets include provider networks  trademarks  state contracts  licenses and permits 
our intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from approximately one to years 
we use a two step process to review goodwill for impairment 
the first step is a screen for potential impairment  and the second step measures the amount of impairment  if any 
we review goodwill and intangible assets for potential impairment at least annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances occur that may affect the estimated useful life or the recoverability of the remaining balance of goodwill or intangible assets 
events or changes in circumstances would include significant changes in membership  state funding  medical contracts and provider networks 
we evaluate the potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets using both the income and market approach 
in doing so  we must make assumptions and estimates  such as the discount factor and peer benchmarking  in estimating fair values 
while we believe these assumptions and estimates are appropriate  other assumptions and estimates could be applied and might produce significantly different results 
an impairment loss is recognized for goodwill and intangible assets if the carrying value of such assets exceeds its fair value 
we select the second quarter of each year for our annual impairment test  which generally coincides with the finalization of federal and state contract negotiations and our initial budgeting process 
our annual impairment test was completed during the third quarter of we assessed the book value of goodwill and other intangible assets and have determined that the fair value of our goodwill exceeds its carrying value  and as a result  there were no indications of additional impairment testing required as of december we evaluated the intangible assets used in our pffs business  which primarily consisted of state licenses for the insurance companies that underwrote that line of business 
as we continue to use these company licenses for other lines of business and the licenses have a market value  we determined that these assets were not impaired 
based on the general economic conditions and outlook during  we performed an analysis of the underlying valuation of goodwill at december  upon reviewing the valuation results  we determined that the goodwill associated with our medicare reporting unit was fully impaired 
the impairment to our medicare reporting unit was due to  among other things  the anticipated operating environment resulting from regulatory changes and new health care legislation  and the resulting effects on our future membership trends 
in  we recorded goodwill impairment expense of million  and a corresponding write down to goodwill to reflect its fair value as presented in the consolidated balance sheet 
recently adopted accounting standards in february  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued authoritative guidance related to subsequent events 
this standard updates subsequent event guidance  issued in may  requiring reporting entities to provide the date through which subsequent event reviews occurred  which was in conflict with certain sec requirements 
accordingly  the update to previously issued subsequent event guidance removes the requirement to disclose a date through which subsequent events have been evaluated 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued authoritative guidance related to improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
this standard requires reporting entities to make new disclosures about recurring or nonrecurring fair value measurements including significant transfers into and out of level and level fair value measurements and information on purchases  sales  issuances and settlements on a gross basis in the reconciliation of level fair value measurements 
this standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for level reconciliation disclosures which are effective for annual periods beginning after december  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on our financial statements 

table of contents item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk 
as of december  and  we had short term investments of million and million  respectively 
at december  and  we had investments classified as long term in the amount of million and million  respectively 
we also had restricted investments of million and million  at december  and  respectively  which consist principally of restricted deposits in accordance with regulatory requirements 
the short term investments consist of highly liquid securities with maturities between three and months as well as longer term bonds with floating interest rates that are considered available for sale 
restricted assets consist of cash and cash equivalents and us treasury instruments deposited or pledged to state agencies in accordance with state rules and regulations 
these restricted assets are classified as long term regardless of the contractual maturity date due to the nature of the states requirements 
the investments classified as long term are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market rates increase 
because of their short term nature  however  we would not expect the value of these investments to decline significantly as a result of a sudden change in market interest rates 
assuming a hypothetical and immediate increase in market interest rates at december   the fair value of our fixed income investments would decrease by approximately million 
similarly  a decrease in market interest rates at december  would result in an increase of the fair value of our investments by less than million
