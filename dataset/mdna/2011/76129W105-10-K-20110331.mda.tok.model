forward looking statement warning certain statements included by reference in this filing containing the words could  may  believes  anticipates  intends  expects  and similar such words constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act 
any forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties  and other factors that may cause our actual results  performance  or achievements to be materially different from any future results  performance  or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
such factors include  among others  our ability to maintain liquidity  our maintenance of patent protection  the impact of current litigation  our ability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relationships  our ability to quickly increase capacity in response to an increase in demand  our ability to access the market  our ability to maintain or lower production costs  our ability to continue to finance research and development as well as operations and expansion of production  the increased interest of larger market players  specifically bd  in providing devices to the safety market  and other factors referenced in item a 
risk factors 
given these uncertainties  undue reliance should not be placed on forward looking statements 
overview we have been manufacturing and marketing our products into the marketplace since we currently provide other safety medical products in addition to safety syringe products 
one such product is the patient safe syringe  which is uniquely designed to reduce the risk of bloodstream infections resulting from catheter hub contamination 
safety syringes comprised of our sales in historically  unit sales have increased in the latter part of the year due  in part  to the demand for syringes during the flu season 
in  we had a contract to provide dhhs with syringes to be used in the us efforts to provide swine flu vaccinations 
this contract was material for and affects comparability to financial data 
our products have been and continue to be distributed nationally through numerous distributors 
however  we have been blocked from access to the market by exclusive marketing practices engaged in by bd  which dominates the market 
we believe that its monopolistic business practices continue despite i its paying million in to settle a prior lawsuit with us for anticompetitive practices  business disparagement  and tortious interference and ii the fact that its integra products were found to infringe our products in may the court s injunction in this case was stayed pending appeal 
although we have made limited progress in some areas  such as the alternate care and international markets  our volumes are not as high as they should be given the nature and quality of our products and the federal and state legislation requiring the use of safe needle devices 
we continue to pursue various strategies to have better access to the hospital market  as well as other markets  including attempting to gain access to the market through our sales efforts  our innovative technology  introduction of new products  and  when necessary  litigation 
we are also marketing more products internationally 
in the event we continue to have only limited market access and the cash provided by the litigation settlements and generated from operations becomes insufficient  we would take additional cost cutting measures to reduce cash requirements 
such measures could result in the reduction of units being produced  the reduction of workforce  the reduction of salaries of officers and other nonhourly employees  and the deferral of royalty payments 
we took such actions at the end of the second quarter of at the end of the second quarter of  we announced that in the interest of the long term survival of the company we would reorganize some of the company s functions and implement staff reductions  all in order to minimize our cash expenditures and conserve our resources 
our workforce was reduced by on july  however  due to the increase in production from sales to dhhs  we increased the workforce at the little elm facility beginning in the latter part of the third quarter of salaries for all personnel above a certain salary level were cut by in although certain salary reductions remain in place  we granted payments to our employees to offset such salary reductions in as a result of the cost cutting measures  compensation costs for included in operating expenses were reduced by  our litigation costs for were approximately million less than the prior year 
additional reductions in expenses in as compared to include reductions of  for stock option expense   for travel and entertainment   for consulting   in k expense  and  for marketing expense 
we are bringing additional molding operations to little elm as a cost saving measure 
we continue to focus on methods of upgrading our manufacturing capability and efficiency in order to reduce costs 
effective july   we entered into a settlement agreement with abbott and hospira 
pursuant to this settlement agreement  we received million in the third quarter of and abbott waived its rights to a marketing fee of  and any series iv class b preferred stock dividends 
additionally  we granted hospira an exclusive one year option to negotiate a licensing agreement for certain uses of our patient safe syringe 
it has not exercised its option 
as part of the option fee  we have received from hospira two payments of million each in the fourth quarter of and first quarter of and expect another two payments of million each in the second and third quarters of  for a total of million 
in the third quarter of  we granted bonuses to certain officers and employees in recognition of work leading to the abbott settlement 
in the second quarter of  we reached an agreement with our counsel  locke lord bissell liddell  regarding future litigation expenditures that caps certain of our litigation costs in exchange for a contingent fee interest 
we believe this agreement serves both our short term and long term interests and will reduce the legal fee component of our general and administrative costs and will impact our cash flow in a positive manner 
product purchases from double dove  a chinese manufacturer  have enabled us to increase manufacturing capacity with little capital outlay and have provided a competitive manufacturing cost 
in  double dove manufactured approximately of the units we produced 
the cost of production per unit has generally declined as volumes increased 
we believe we could make up any long term disruption in these supplies by utilizing more of the capacity at the little elm facility  except for the ml insulin syringe  the ml and ml syringes  and the autodisable syringe which altogether comprised about of our revenues 
with increased volumes  our manufacturing unit costs have generally tended to decline 
factors that could affect our unit costs include increases in costs by third party manufacturers  changing production volumes  costs of petroleum products  and transportation costs 
increases in such costs may not be recoverable through price increases of our products 
results of operations the following discussion contains trend information and other forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
our actual future results could differ materially from our historical results of operations and those discussed in the forward looking statements 
all period references are to our fiscal years ended december   or dollar amounts have been rounded for ease of reading 
comparison of year ended december  and year ended december  revenues decreased  due principally to the effect of the dhhs contract in domestic sales were of revenues with international sales comprising the remainder 
unit sales decreased 
domestic unit sales decreased and average sales prices increased 
international unit sales increased and average international selling prices increased 
cost of sales decreased due to lower volume of product sold 
royalty expenses increased due to higher gross sales as well as net litigation proceeds 
as a result  gross profit margins decreased from in to in operating expenses decreased from the prior year due to lower litigation costs  lower compensation costs  lower stock option expense  and lower travel and entertainment costs 
our litigation costs for were approximately million less than the prior year 
lower litigation costs are the result of an agreement between us and our counsel to cap certain litigation fees 
additional reductions in expenses in as compared to include reductions of  for consulting   in k expense  and  for marketing expense 
in  we recognized impairment charges of  for costs associated with research and development activities compared to impairment charges of million in associated with catheter production equipment 
operating loss was million in compared to an operating loss in of million 
interest income decreased due to lower interest rates 
interest expense increased due to higher average loan balances and a reduction in capitalized interest 
litigation settlements  net reflects cash proceeds of million from hospira and a waiver of million in marketing fees payable to abbott 
a receivable from abbott for thousand was also waived 
benefit for income taxes consists principally of additional refunds due for our federal tax return reduced by thousand due in alternative minimum tax for cash flow from operations was million for due principally to litigation settlements and improved results from operations 
comparison of year ended december  and year ended december  revenues increased  due principally to sales under the dhhs contract 
domestic sales were of revenues with international sales comprising the remainder 
without the dhhs contract  our revenues would have increased  with domestic revenues increasing and international revenues declining 
unit sales of the ml syringe increased and ml unit sales increased 
unit sales of all products increased 
domestic unit sales as well as average sales prices increased 
international unit sales decreased slightly and average selling prices increased 
sales to two customers accounted for of our revenues in only one of these two customers was a customer in  and such customer accounted for of our revenues in cost of sales increased due to greater volumes 
royalty expenses were higher due to higher gross sales 
as a result  gross profit margins increased from in to in operating expenses increased from the prior year due to litigation costs and stock option expense mitigated by the cost cutting measures beginning in the third quarter of sales and marketing expenses decreased due primarily to lower compensation due to staff reduction and reduction in pay  lower advertising expenses  and reduced travel costs 
stock option expense and consulting costs increased 
research and development costs were lower 
we had decreases in engineering costs due principally to reduction in staff and pay as well as lower consulting cost 
stock option expense increased 
general and administrative costs increased due principally to litigation costs and stock option expense 
compensation costs decreased due to staff reductions and reductions in pay 
in the fourth quarter of  we recognized an impairment charge of  associated with catheter production equipment 
interest income decreased due to lower interest rates and lower cash balances 
interest expense decreased due to capitalized interest 
the company recognized a tax benefit in primarily due to a federal tax carryback related to preferred stock dividend requirements decreased slightly due to conversion of preferred stock in the first quarter of the dividend arrearage at december   on all classes of preferred stock was approximately million 
cash flow from operations was a negative million for due principally to operating losses and increases in receivables 
most of the increase in receivables was related to billings in december to dhhs and collected in january the increase in income taxes receivable was related to a refund for carryback of our net operating loss 
we filed for this refund early in the second quarter of and received the refund in the effect of non cash expenses and the change in working capital was a negative million 
investing activities utilized million in cash 
liquidity at the present time  management does not intend to raise equity capital 
due to the funds received from prior litigation settlements  we have sufficient cash reserves and intend to rely on operations  cash reserves  and debt financing as the primary ongoing sources of cash 
our cash position has improved million  or  over the improvement is directly related to the litigation proceeds paid in and the effect of cost reduction measures taken in and reduction in litigation costs  particularly from the second quarter of through the end of the year  were significant 
we expect these lower litigation costs and the effect of the cost reductions to continue 
historical sources of liquidity we have historically funded operations primarily from the proceeds from revenues  private placements  loans  and litigation settlements 
internal sources of liquidity margins and market access to routinely achieve break even quarters  we need minimal access to hospital markets which has been difficult to obtain due to the monopolistic marketplace which was the subject of our initial lawsuit and now also included in our second antitrust lawsuit against bd 
we will continue to attempt to gain access to the market through our sales efforts  innovative technology  the introduction of new products  and  when necessary  litigation 
we continue to focus on methods of upgrading our manufacturing capability and efficiency in order to reduce costs 
fluctuations in the cost and availability of raw materials and inventory and our ability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relationships could result in the need to manufacture all as opposed to of our products in the us this could temporarily increase unit costs as we ramp up domestic production 
the mix of domestic and international sales affects the average sales price of our products 
generally  the higher the ratio of domestic sales to international sales  the higher the average sales price will be 
typically international sales are shipped directly from china to the customer 
purchases of product manufactured in china  if available  usually decrease the average cost of manufacture for all units 
domestic costs  such as indirect labor and overhead  remain relatively constant 
the number of units produced by the company versus manufactured in china can have a significant effect on the carrying costs of inventory as well as cost of sales 
we will continue to evaluate the appropriate mix of products manufactured domestically and those manufactured in china to achieve economic benefits as well as to maintain our domestic manufacturing capability 
fluctuations in the cost of oil since our products are petroleum based and transportation and the volume of units purchased from double dove may have an impact on the unit costs of our product 
increases in such costs may not be recoverable through price increases of our products 
reductions in oil prices may not quickly affect petroleum product prices 
seasonality historically  unit sales have increased in the latter part of the year due  in part  to the demand for syringes during the flu season 
in  we had a contract to provide dhhs with syringes to be used in the us efforts to provide swine flu vaccinations 
this contract was material for and affects comparability to financial data 
cash requirements due to funds received from prior litigation settlements  we have sufficient cash reserves and intend to rely on operations  cash reserves  and debt financing as the primary ongoing sources of cash 
in the event we continue to have only limited market access and cash generated from operations becomes insufficient to support operations  we would take additional cost cutting measures to reduce cash requirements 
such measures could result in the reduction of units being produced  the reduction of workforce  the reduction of salaries of officers and other nonhourly employees  and the deferral of royalty payments 
external sources of liquidity we have obtained several loans from our inception  which have  together with the proceeds from the sales of equities and litigation efforts  enabled us to pursue development and production of our products 
given the current economic conditions  our ability to obtain additional funds through loans is uncertain 
furthermore  the shareholders previously authorized an additional  shares of a class c preferred stock that could  if necessary  be designated and used to raise funds through the sale of equity 
due to the current market price of our common stock  it is unlikely we would choose to raise funds by the sale of equity 
effective july   we entered into a settlement agreement with abbott and hospira 
pursuant to this settlement agreement  we received million in the third quarter of and abbott waived its rights to a marketing fee of  and any series iv class b preferred stock dividends 
additionally  we granted hospira an exclusive one year option to negotiate a licensing agreement for certain uses of our patient safe syringe 
it has not exercised its option 
as part of the option fee  we have received from hospira two payments of million each in the fourth quarter of and first quarter of and expect another two payments of million each in the second and third quarters of  for a total of million 
capital resources material commitments for expenditures in march  we purchased four molding machines to expand our in house molding capability and further reduce costs 
the purchase price is  and financing is expected to be completed in the second quarter of trends in capital resources interest expense may increase due to the reduction of capitalized interest at the present time 
it may also be affected by additional loans or rising interest rates 
interest income may continue to be negatively affected by lower interest rates and our prior movement of cash to us treasury bills and other us government backed securities 
although we believe that we have granted credit to credit worthy firms  current economic conditions may affect the timing and or collectability of some accounts 
off balance sheet arrangements none 
contractual obligations contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following chart summarizes our material obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts for long term debt as of december  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years contractual obligations long term debt  including current maturities operating lease these amounts do not reflect the effect of the beneficial conversion feature of the note payable to katie petroleum and therefore will be greater than the amounts in the financial statements 
significant accounting policies we consider the following to be our most significant accounting policies 
careful consideration and review is given to these and all accounting policies on a routine basis to ensure that they are accurately and consistently applied 
accounts receivable we record trade receivables when revenue is recognized 
no product has been consigned to customers 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is primarily determined by review of specific trade receivables 
those accounts that are doubtful of collection are included in the allowance 
an additional allowance has been established based on a percentage of receivables outstanding 
these provisions are reviewed to determine the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
trade receivables are charged off when there is certainty as to their being uncollectible 
trade receivables are considered delinquent when payment has not been made within contract terms 
we require certain distributors to make a prepayment prior to beginning production or shipment of their order 
distributors may apply such prepayments to their outstanding invoices or pay the invoice and continue to carryforward the deposit for future orders 
such amounts are included in other accrued liabilities on the balance sheets and are shown in note  other accrued liabilities 
we record an allowance for estimated returns as a reduction to accounts receivable and gross sales 
historically  returns have been less than of net sales 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized for sales when title and risk of ownership passes to the customer  generally upon shipment 
under certain contracts  revenue is recorded on the basis of sales price to distributors  less contractual pricing allowances 
contractual pricing allowances consist of i rebates granted to distributors who provide tracking reports which show  among other things  the facility that purchased the products  and ii a provision for estimated contractual pricing allowances for products that we have not received tracking reports 
rebates are recorded when issued and are applied against the customer s receivable balance 
distributors receive a rebate for the difference between the wholesale acquisition cost and the appropriate contract price as reflected on a tracking report provided by the distributor to us 
if product is sold by a distributor to an entity that has no contract  there is a standard rebate lower than a contracted rebate given to the distributor 
one of the purposes of the rebate is to encourage distributors to submit tracking reports to us 
the provision for contractual pricing allowances is reviewed at the end of each quarter and adjusted for changes in levels of products for which there is no tracking report 
additionally  if it becomes clear that tracking reports will not be provided by individual distributors  the provision is further adjusted 
the estimated contractual allowance is netted against the individual distributor s accounts receivable balances for financial reporting purposes 
the resulting net balance is reflected in accounts receivable or accounts payable  as appropriate 
the terms and conditions of contractual pricing allowances are governed by contracts between us and our distributors 
revenue for shipments directly to end users is recognized when title and risk of ownership passes from us 
any product shipped or distributed for evaluation purposes is expensed 
certain distributors have taken rebates to which they are not entitled  such as utilizing a rebate for products not purchased directly from us 
we have been in discussions with the principal customers that claimed non contractual rebates 
major customers said they have ceased the practices resulting in claiming non contractual rebates 
the product for which they were claiming rebates was actually product they had not purchased from us 
rebates can only be claimed on purchases made directly from us 
we have established a reserve for the collectability of these non contractual rebate amounts 
the expense for the reserve is recorded in operating expense  general and administrative 
the reserve for such non contractual deductions is a reduction of accounts receivable 
our domestic return policy is set forth in our standard distribution agreement 
this policy provides that a customer may return incorrect shipments within days following arrival at the distributor s facility 
in all such cases the distributor must obtain an authorization code from us and affix the code to the returned product 
we will not accept returned goods without a returned goods authorization number 
we may refund the customer s money or replace the product 
our domestic return policy also provides that a customer may return product that is overstocked 
overstocking returns are limited to two times in each month period up to of distributor s total purchase of products for the prior month period 
all product overstocks and returns are subject to inspection and acceptance by us 
our international distribution agreements do not provide for any returns 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  with cost being determined using actual average cost 
we compare the average cost to the market price and record the lower value 
management considers such factors as the amount of inventory on hand and in the distribution channel  estimated time to sell such inventory  the shelf life of inventory  and current market conditions when determining excess or obsolete inventories 
a reserve is established for any excess or obsolete inventories or they may be written off 
marketing fees in prior periods  marketing fees payable to abbott were included in current liabilities in the balance sheets 
in connection with the settlement with abbott  marketing fees payable recorded in previous periods will not have to be paid 
the reversal of this accrual is included in litigation settlements  net on the statements of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we believe that our market risk exposures regarding our cash and cash equivalents are immaterial as we do not have instruments for trading purposes 
we shifted the bulk of our funds into us treasury bills and other us government backed securities in april additionally  reasonable  possible near term changes in market rates or prices will not result in material changes in near term earnings
