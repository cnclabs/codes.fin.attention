financing on january   we issued approximately billion equivalent aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to rule a under the securities act of  as amended  or the securities act  and outside the united states to certain non us persons pursuant to regulation s under the securities act 
the notes were issued by our wholly owned subsidiary virgin media secured finance plc in two tranches billion of senior secured notes due and million of senior secured notes due  collectively referred to as the senior secured notes 
the net proceeds from the issuance of the senior secured notes were used to prepay a portion of the outstanding loans under our senior credit facility  reducing the outstanding amounts due under our senior credit facility to approximately billion equivalent as of january  
table of contents the senior secured notes rank pari passu with our senior credit facility and  subject to certain exceptions  share in the same guarantees and security as granted in favor of our senior credit facility 
for more information about our senior secured notes  see management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition liquidity and capital resources senior secured notes 
on march   we entered into a senior credit facility with lenders under which the lenders agreed to make available to certain subsidiaries of the company a term loan a facility  or tranche a  and a revolving credit facility  or the rcf 
on april   a term loan b facility  or tranche b  was added to the senior credit facility by way of an accession deed between virgin media investment holdings limited and deutsche bank ag  london branch 
tranche b has been syndicated to a group of lenders 
on april   we drew down an aggregate principal amount of  million under the senior credit facility and applied the proceeds towards the repayment in full of all amounts outstanding under our old senior credit facility dated march  as amended and restated from time to time as at the draw down date 
on february   we further amended our senior credit facility to increase operational flexibility 
on august   we completed an offer to exchange any and all of the then outstanding senior secured notes due  which we originally issued in a us private placement  for an equivalent amount of new senior secured notes due which have been registered under the us securities act of  as amended 
in connection with this offer  we exchanged a total of  aggregate principal amount  or of the original us dollar denominated notes  and  aggregate principal amount  or of the original sterling denominated notes  for an equivalent amount of newly issued senior secured notes due holders of the original senior secured notes due who did not tender their notes in compliance with the offer terms will remain subject to restrictions on transfer of these notes 
completion of the exchange offer satisfied our obligations in full under a registration rights agreement entered into in connection with the original note issuance in january we did not receive any additional proceeds from the exchange offer 
for further details relating to the exchange offer  please see amendment no 
to the registration statement on form s of virgin media inc  as filed with the sec on june  capital structure optimization on july   we announced our intention to undertake a range of capital structure optimization actions 
this capital structure optimization program is expected to include the application of  in aggregate  up to million  in part towards repurchases of up to million of our common stock until august and in part towards transactions relating to our debt and convertible debt  including related derivative transactions and the conversion hedges described below 
on october   we executed conversion hedges with several hedge counterparties relating to our billion aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due  issued pursuant to an indenture dated as of april  these transactions relate to of the aggregate principal amount of the convertible senior notes and are intended to offset a portion of the dilutive effects that would potentially be associated with conversion of the convertible senior notes at maturity  by raising the stock price at which we could incur economic dilution from per share  the initial conversion price of the convertible senior notes  to per share 
during the year ended december   we repurchased approximately million shares of common stock  at an average purchase price per share of through the accelerated stock repurchase program mentioned above for an aggregate purchase price of million or million  and million shares of common stock  at an average purchase price per share of through an open market repurchase program for 
table of contents an aggregate purchase price of million or million 
the shares of common stock acquired in connection with these programs have been cancelled 
the remaining amount authorized under this plan is million million based on the exchange rate as at december  
revenue our revenue by segment for the years ended december   and was as follows in millions year ended december  consumer business the principal sources of revenue within each segment are consumer monthly fees and usage charges for cable and non cable telephone and internet access services and cable television services  monthly fees and usage charges for mobile services including charges for airtime  data  long distance calls and roaming  and charges for the supply of mobile handset and other equipment 
business monthly fees and usage charges for inbound and outbound voice  data and internet services and charges for transmission  fiber and voice services provided to retail and wholesale customers 
expenses the principal components of our operating costs and selling  general and administrative expenses within each segment include consumer payroll and other employee related costs including outsourcing  television programming services and programming costs  interconnect costs paid to carriers relating to call termination services  marketing and selling costs  and purchase costs of mobile handsets and other equipment 
business payroll and other employee related costs  interconnect and circuit costs paid to other telecommunication carriers  and marketing and selling costs 

table of contents other costs of maintaining our cable network infrastructure and it systems  facility related costs  such as rent  utilities and rates  costs associated with providing customer services  and allowances for doubtful accounts 
disposal of business units disposals on june   we announced the sale to bskyb of our television channel business known as virgin media tv 
virgin media tv s operations comprised our former content segment 
we determined that as of june  the planned sale met the requirements for virgin media tv to be reflected as assets and liabilities held for sale and discontinued operations in both the current and prior periods and  accordingly we adjusted the consolidated balance sheet as of december  and consolidated statements of operations and cash flows for the years ended december  and we have also entered into a number of agreements providing for the carriage by us of certain of bskyb s standard and high definition channels along with the former virgin media tv channels sold 
the agreements in respect to the sale of virgin media tv and the carriage of these channels were negotiated concurrently 
we have determined that these agreements are separate units of account as described by the fair value measurements guidance issued by the fasb 
we have performed a review of the fair value of the services received and the business disposed of to determine the appropriate values to attribute to each unit of account 
as a result  million of the gain on disposal of virgin media tv was deferred on the balance sheet and will be treated as a reduction in operating costs over the contractual terms of the carriage arrangements  which range from to years 
during  million of this deferred gain was recognized in the consolidated statement of operations 
the results of operations of virgin media tv have been included as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations through july   which is the date the sale was completed following approval from regulators in ireland 
on that date  consideration was received totaling million 
on september   additional consideration of million was received upon full approval of the transaction by uk regulators 
the terms of the sale and purchase agreement include certain customary warranties  guarantees and working capital adjustments which may impact the amount recognized in future periods 
revenue of the virgin media tv business  reported in discontinued operations  for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
virgin media tv s pre tax income  reported within discontinued operations  for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
virgin media tv s pre tax loss  reported within discontinued operations was million for the year ended december  factors affecting our business a number of factors affect the performance of our business  at both a general and segment level 

table of contents general factors that affect all of the segments in which we operate are as follows general macroeconomic factors 
general macroeconomic factors in the uk have an impact on our business 
for example  during an economic slowdown  potential and existing customers may be less willing  or able to purchase our products or upgrade their services 
we may also experience increased churn and higher bad debt expense 
in addition  expenditures by advertisers are sensitive to economic conditions and tend to decline in recessionary periods and other periods of uncertainty 
currency movements 
we encounter currency exchange rate risks because substantially all of our revenue and operating costs are earned and paid primarily in uk pounds sterling  but we pay interest and principal obligations with respect to a portion of our existing indebtedness in us dollars and euros 
we have in place hedging programs that seek to mitigate the risk from these exposures 
while the objective of these programs is to reduce the volatility of our cash flows and earnings caused by changes in underlying currency exchange rates  not all of our exposures are hedged  and not all of our hedges are designated as such for accounting purposes 
additionally  we do not hedge the principal portion of our convertible senior notes 
we also purchase goods and services in us dollars  euros and south african rand  such as customer premise equipment and network maintenance services and a substantial portion of these exposures are not hedged 
competition 
our ability to acquire and retain customers and increase revenue depends on our competitive strength 
there is significant and increasing competition in the market for our consumer services  including broadband and telephone services offered by bt  resellers or local loop unbundlers  such as bskyb and talk talk telecom group plc  alternative internet access services such as dsl  satellite television services offered by bskyb and by bbc and itv through freesat  free to air digital terrestrial television offered through freeview  internet protocol television offered by bt  and mobile telephone  television and data services offered by other mobile network operators  or mnos  including everything everywhere limited the joint venture between t mobile uk and orange uk  o  vodafone and uk  and from other mobile virtual network operators  including tesco mobile  lebara  carphone warehouse and asda 
in addition  certain competitors  such as bt  bskyb and large mnos  are dominant in markets in which we compete and may use their dominance in those markets to offer bundled services that compete with our product offerings 
as a result of increased competition  we have had to  and may be required to continue to  adjust our pricing and offer discounts to new and existing customers in order to attract and retain customers 
there is also significant and increasing competition in the market for our business services  including data and voice services offered by bt  cable wireless plc  virtual network operators and systems integrators 
while bt represents the main competitive threat nationally due to its network reach and product portfolio  we also compete with regional providers  such as colt telecom group plc  which have a strong network presence within limited geographic areas 
recently we have also faced increasing competition from the launch of business services by mnos 
integration and restructuring activities 
in the fourth quarter of  we commenced the implementation of a restructuring plan aimed at driving further improvements in our operational performance and eliminating inefficiencies in order to create a fully integrated  customer focused organization 
we anticipate significant cost savings from the plan and that savings will exceed the costs incurred in connection with the plan 
these costs will include purchases of fixed assets  lease and contract exit costs  employee termination costs and other restructuring and restructuring related expenses  some of which will be classified as restructuring costs 
during the second quarter of  we identified further savings through the expansion of the program and revised the estimated total costs and extended the completion date through the end of in total  we expect to incur operating expenditures of between million to million and capital expenditures of between million to million in connection with this plan over a four year period 
our financial performance may be negatively affected if we are unable to implement our restructuring plan successfully and realize the anticipated benefits 

table of contents capital expenditures 
our business requires substantial capital expenditures on a continuing basis for various purposes  including expanding  maintaining and upgrading our network  investing in new customer acquisitions  and offering new services 
if we do not continue to invest in our network and in new technologies  our ability to retain and acquire customers may be hindered 
therefore  our liquidity and the availability of cash to fund capital projects are important drivers of our revenue 
when our liquidity is restricted  so is our ability to meet our capital expenditure requirements 
consumer segment in our consumer segment  cable customers account for the majority of our revenue 
the number of customers  the number and types of services that each customer uses and the prices we charge for these services drive our revenue 
our profit is driven by the relative margins on the types and number of services we provide to these customers and by the number of services that we provide to them and  with respect to our fixed and mobile telephone customers  by usage levels of our services 
for example  cable broadband internet is more profitable than our television services and  on average  our triple play customers are more profitable than double play or single play customers 
similarly  over the service term  our contract mobile customers are more profitable than our prepay mobile customers  and provide a better opportunity for cross sell of our cable products 
we actively promote quad play services  and our packaging of services and our pricing are designed to encourage our customers to use multiple services such as television  fixed and mobile telephone and broadband at a lower price than each stand alone product on a combined basis 
factors particularly affecting our consumer segment include arpu  churn  seasonality and distribution 
cable arpu 
cable arpu is a measure we use to evaluate how effectively we are realizing potential revenue from our residential cable customers on our network 
we believe that our triple play cable offering of television  broadband and fixed line telephone services is attractive to our existing cable customer base and generally allows us to increase our cable arpu by facilitating the sale of multiple services to each customer 
cable arpu excludes any revenue from our mobile and non cable customers 
mobile arpu 
mobile arpu is a measure we use to evaluate how effectively we are realizing revenue from our mobile customers 
the mix of prepay and contract customers and level of usage have a material impact on mobile arpu 
the mix of our customer base is changing as we focus on acquiring higher lifetime value contract customers  particularly through cross selling mobile contracts to our cable customer base  rather than lower lifetime value prepay customers 
consequently  the number of prepay customers is expected to continue to decline in  along with prepay usage 
churn 
churn is a measure of the number of customers who stop subscribing to any of our services 
an increase in our churn can lead to increased costs and reduced revenue 
we continue to focus on improving our customer service and enhancing and expanding our service offerings to existing customers in order to manage our churn rates 
our ability to reduce our churn rates beyond a base level is limited by factors like competition  the economy and  in respect of our cable business  customers moving outside our network service area  in particular during the summer season 
managing our churn rates is a significant component of our business plan 
our churn rates may increase if our customer service is seen as unsatisfactory  if we are unable to deliver any of our services without interruption  if we fail to match offerings by our competitors  if we increase our prices  if there is an improvement in the uk housing market or if there is a prolonged economic downturn 
seasonality 
some of our consumer revenue streams are subject to seasonal factors 
for example  telephone usage revenue by residential customers tends to be slightly lower during summer holiday months 
in the fourth quarter of each year  our mobile customer acquisition and retention costs typically increase due to the christmas holiday period 
our mobile arpu generally decreases in the first quarter of each year due to the fewer number of days in february and lower usage after the christmas holiday period 
our churn rates include persons who disconnect their service because of moves  resulting in a seasonal increase in our churn rates during the summer months when higher levels of uk house moves occur and students leave their accommodation between academic years 

table of contents distribution 
we rely  to a large extent  upon third parties to distribute our mobile products and services 
if any of these distribution partners were to cease to act as distributors for our products and services  or the commissions or other costs charged by the third parties were to increase  our ability to gain new mobile customers or retain existing customers may be adversely affected 
we continue to increase the proportion of our products distributed through our own channels including our retail outlets 
business segment factors particularly affecting our business segment include pricing  operational effectiveness and changes in government spending 
pricing 
competition in the uk business telecommunications market continues to be based on value for money  the key components of which are quality  reliability and price 
certain of bt s product pricing is regulated by the uk office of communications  however  in respect of non regulated product pricing  the market is increasingly price sensitive  particularly in the current challenging economic conditions 
operational effectiveness 
the extensive use of optical fiber in our access networks allows us to provide high speed ethernet services directly to business customers and to provide nationwide area networking to these customers via our core networks 
business customers require timely installation services and our ability to meet required timescales and commence providing services may impact our revenues 
we regularly rely on third party suppliers to connect business customers and we have a variety of alternative methods to connect our national telecommunications network to the premises of business customers that are located outside of our cabled areas 
government spending 
public sector organizations  in particular local authorities  represent a significant proportion of the customer base in our business segment 
accordingly  changes to the uk government s allocation of funding and spending levels with respect to certain programs have had  and may continue to have  an effect on our business segment revenue 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements and related financial information are based on the application of us gaap 
gaap requires the use of estimates  assumptions  judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets  liabilities  revenue and expense amounts reported  as well as disclosures about contingencies  risk and financial condition 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
the following critical accounting policies have the potential to have a significant impact on our financial statements 
an impact could occur because of the significance of the financial statement item to which these policies relate  or because these policies require more judgment and estimation than other matters owing to the uncertainty related to measuring  at a specific point in time  transactions that are continuous in nature 
we have discussed the development and selection of the following critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to them 
these policies may need to be revised in the future in the event that changes to our business occur 
impairment of indefinite lived assets goodwill arising from business combinations  reorganization value in excess of amounts allocable to identifiable assets and intangible assets with indefinite lives  are subject to annual review for impairment or more frequently should indications of impairment arise 
impairment of goodwill and reorganization value in excess of amounts allocable to identifiable assets is determined using a two step approach  initially based on a 
table of contents comparison of the reporting unit s fair value to its carrying value  if the fair value is lower than the carrying value  then the second step compares the asset s fair value implied fair value for goodwill and reorganization value in excess of amounts allocable to identifiable assets with its carrying value to measure the amount of the impairment 
impairment of intangible assets with indefinite lives is determined based on a comparison of fair value to carrying value 
any excess of carrying value over fair value is recognized as an impairment loss 
we incurred impairment charges in in respect of our former mobile and sit up reporting units  and we may incur further impairment charges if  for example  market values decline or we do not achieve expected cash flows 
as a result of the business reorganization initiated in  we realigned our internal reporting structure and the related financial information used by management and the chief operating decision maker codm 
during the first quarter of  our operating structures were revised with a view to building a customer focused organization able to respond effectively to rapid changes in the market  technology and customer demands through three new customer based segments consumer  business and content 
our internal reporting structure and the related financial information used by management and the codm were amended to reflect changes we have made after the announcement of the sale of virgin media tv  which comprised our content segment  to bskyb in june accordingly  we now have two reporting units consisting of consumer and business  both of which are evaluated for impairment purposes as at october of each year 
while we utilize a variety of valuation techniques to determine fair value  including market multiples and comparable transactions  estimated fair value is generally measured by discounting estimated future cash flows 
the following discussion summarizes each approach used to determine fair value and how it has been utilized by us market multiple approach this method provides indications of value based upon comparisons of the reporting unit to market values and pricing evidence of public companies involved in the same or similar lines of business 
market ratios pricing multiples and performance fundamentals relating to the public companies stock prices equity or enterprise values to certain underlying fundamental data are applied to the reporting unit to determine its fair value 
we utilize publicly available information regarding comparable companies which operate in north america and europe 
comparable transaction approach this method includes an examination of recent mergers and acquisitions which involves companies in the same or similar lines of business to the reporting unit 
acquisition values and pricing evidence are used in much the same manner as the market multiple approach for the determination of the reporting unit s fair value 
discounted cash flow approach this method calculates the present value of the projected future cash flows to be generated by the reporting unit using appropriate discount rates 
the discount rates are intended to reflect all associated risks of realizing the projected future cash flows 
terminal value is computed as of the end of the last period for which cash flows are projected utilizing a terminal multiple to determine an estimate of the value of the reporting unit as of that future point in time 
the terminal multiple employed is estimated utilizing the information attained regarding comparable companies and transactions 
discounting the terminal value back to the present and adding the present values of the future cash flows yields indications of the reporting unit s fair value 
the discount rate employed was determined using market assumptions including uk gilt yields  equity risk premiums and comparable company betas as well as ibbotson s research including size decile betas and size risk premiums 
the determination of the discount rate also utilized information regarding the cost of debt and capital structures of comparable companies along with other general market reference materials from companies such as bloomberg  standard poors and morningstar 
all of these techniques are reliant on our long range cash flow forecasts 
in estimating cash flows  we use financial assumptions in our internal forecasting model such as projected customer numbers  projected product sales mix and price changes  projected changes in prices we pay for purchases of fixed assets and services as well 
table of contents as projected labor costs 
considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate discounted future cash flows and those estimates include inherent uncertainties  including those relating to the timing and amount of future cash flows and the discount rate used in the calculation 
assumptions used in these cash flow projections are consistent with our internal forecasts 
if actual results differ from the assumptions used in the impairment review  we may incur additional impairment charges in the future 
assumptions made about levels of competition and rates of growth or decline in the economy on a longer term basis could impact the valuation to be used in future annual impairment testing 
the table below presents the goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets allocated to our consumer and business reporting units  and the significant inputs utilized in developing our estimate of fair value for the annual impairment tests performed in for each of these reporting units 
consumer business goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles as at december   million million market multiples inputs number of comparable companies nine seven ebitda multiples of comparable companies to times to times revenue multiples of comparable companies to times to times comparable transactions inputs number of transactions sixteen nine ebitda multiples of comparable transactions to times to times revenue multiples of comparable transactions to times to times discounted cash flow approach discount rate applied goodwill relating to our consumer and business reporting units was not at risk of failing step one of the goodwill impairment analysis as of our october  evaluation 
fixed assets labor and overhead costs directly related to the construction and installation of fixed assets  including payroll and related costs of some employees and related rent and other occupancy costs  are capitalized 
the payroll and related costs of some employees that are directly related to construction and installation activities are capitalized based on specific time devoted to these activities where identifiable 
in cases where the time devoted to these activities is not specifically identifiable  we capitalize costs based upon estimated allocations 
costs associated with initial customer installations are capitalized 
the costs of reconnecting the same service to a previously installed premise are charged to expense in the period incurred 
costs for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred 
we assign fixed assets and intangible assets useful lives that impact the annual depreciation and amortization expense 
the assignment of useful lives involves significant judgments and the use of estimates 
our management use their experience and expertise in applying judgments about appropriate estimates 
changes in technology or changes in intended use of these assets may cause the estimated useful life to change  resulting in higher or lower depreciation charges or asset impairment charges 
long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles intangible assets that do not have indefinite lives to be held and used by an entity are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with the property  plant and equipment topic of the fasb asc 
indications of impairment are determined by reviewing undiscounted projected future cash flows 
if impairment is indicated  the amount of the impairment is the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the assets 

table of contents costs associated with construction and installation activities installation revenue for our consumer segment is recognized in accordance with the provisions of the entertainment cable television topic of the fasb asc  in relation to connection and activation fees for cable television  as well as fixed line telephone and broadband internet services  on the basis that we market and maintain a unified fiber network through which we provide all of these services 
installation revenue in our consumer segment is recognized at the time the installation has been completed to the extent that those fees are less than direct selling costs 
installation fees in excess of direct selling costs are deferred and amortized over the expected life of the customer s connection 
the nature and amount of labor and other costs to be capitalized with respect to construction and installation activities involves significant judgment 
in addition to direct external and internal labor and materials  we also capitalize other costs directly attributable to our construction and installation activities 
we continuously monitor the appropriateness of our capitalization policy and update the policy when necessary to respond to changes in facts and circumstances  such as the development of new products and services  and changes in the manner that installations or construction activities are performed 
restructuring costs we account for our restructuring costs in accordance with the exit or disposal cost obligations topic of the fasb asc and recognize a liability for costs associated with restructuring activities when the liability is incurred 
in relation to our restructuring activities  we have recorded a liability of million as of december  primarily relating to lease exit costs of properties that we have vacated 
in calculating the liability  we make a number of estimates and assumptions including the timing of ultimate disposal of the properties  our ability to sublet the properties either in part or as a whole  amounts of sublet rental income achievable including any incentives required to be given in subleases  amounts of lease termination costs  and discount rates 
recent accounting pronouncements in  the fasb amended the accounting standards for revenue recognition to provide updated guidance on determining whether multiple deliverables exist  how the deliverables in an arrangement should be separated  and how the consideration should be allocated  require an entity to allocate revenue in an arrangement using estimated selling prices of deliverables if a vendor does not have vendor specific objective evidence of selling price vsoe or third party evidence tpe of selling price  and eliminate the use of the residual method and require an entity to allocate revenue using the relative selling price method 
we adopted this guidance as of january  on a prospective basis applicable for transactions originating or materially modified after that date 
revenue is allocated to each unit of accounting based on a selling price hierarchy 
the selling price for a deliverable is based on its vsoe if available  tpe if vsoe is not available  or estimated selling price if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
we then recognize revenue on each deliverable in accordance with our policies for product and service revenue recognition 
the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents consolidated results of operations consolidated results of operations for the years ended december  and revenue for the year ended december   revenue increased by to  million from  million for the same period in this increase was due to higher revenue in both our consumer and business segments 
see further discussion of our consumer and business segments below 
operating costs operating costs for the years ended december  and were as follows in millions year ended december  increase decrease adjusted operating costs consumer cost of sales business cost of sales network and other operating costs total operating costs for the year ended december   operating costs  including network expenses  increased by to  million from  million during the same period in this increase was attributable to increases in consumer segment and business segment cost of sales  together with increased network and other operating costs 
consumer segment cost of sales increased primarily as a result of increased revenues  partially offset by lower fixed line telephony interconnect costs as a result of lower usage along with lower mobile telephony interconnect costs as a result of lower wholesale rates 
business cost of sales increased as the impact on costs of higher retail data and wholesale revenues was only partially offset by lower lan solutions and retail voice cost of sales 
network and other operating costs increased primarily as a result of increased employee and outsourcing costs  partially offset by lower facilities costs primarily due to refunds received of local authority taxes relating to our network property 
as a result of these changes  operating costs as a percentage of revenue decreased to for the year from for the year ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  and were as follows in millions year ended december  increase decrease adjusted selling  general and administrative expenses employee and outsourcing costs marketing costs facilities other total selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   selling  general and administrative expenses increased by to million from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to higher marketing and employee and outsourcing costs  partially offset by lower facilities costs  bad 
table of contents debt write offs and reduced it outsourcing costs 
lower facilities costs were partly due to rates refunds received from government authorities during the year along with revisions in our recognition policies in respect of retirement obligations for equipment and leasehold improvements on certain leased premises 
restructuring and other charges for the year ended december   restructuring and other charges increased to million from million for the same period in restructuring and other charges in the year ended december  related primarily to lease exit costs  including the cost of vacating property leases on our great portland street office in central london  and involuntary employee termination costs in connection with the restructuring program initiated in as discussed below 
restructuring and other charges in the year ended december  related primarily to lease exit costs and involuntary employee termination costs in connection with the restructuring program initiated in as discussed below 
during the fourth quarter of  we commenced the implementation of a restructuring plan aimed at driving further improvements in our operational performance and eliminating inefficiencies in order to create a fully integrated  customer focused organization 
this plan involves the incurrence of substantial operating and capital expenditures  including certain costs which we expect to treat as restructuring costs under the exit or disposal cost obligations topic of the fasb asc

amortization expense for the year ended december   amortization expense decreased to million from million for the same period in the decrease in amortization expense was primarily attributable to the cessation of amortization of certain intangible assets that became fully amortized in estimated aggregate amortization expense for is million and nil thereafter 

table of contents goodwill and intangible asset impairments in the first quarter of  we rebranded our business reporting unit with the virgin trademarks 
as a result  we recorded an impairment expense of million for the year ended december  for the telewest trademark 
we performed our annual impairment reviews for our business and consumer reporting units as at october  and as a result of these reviews we concluded that the fair values of the reporting units exceeded their carrying values 
interest expense for the year ended december   interest expense increased to million from million for the same period in  mainly as a result of a larger proportion of higher cost bond debt  partially offset by lower debt balances under the senior credit facility following the prepayments made during the year 
we paid cash interest of million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the increase in cash interest payments was primarily due to differences in the timing of interest payments on our senior credit facility and senior notes 
loss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended december   loss on extinguishment of debt was million  which related to the write off of deferred financing costs as a result of the partial repayments of our senior credit facility in and the call premium totaling million on the repayment of a portion of the senior notes due for the year ended december   loss on extinguishment of debt was million which related to the write off of deferred financing costs as a result of the partial prepayment of our senior credit facility in and the call premium totaling million on the repayment of a portion of the senior notes due share of income from equity investments for the year ended december   share of income from equity investments was million as compared with income of million for the same period in the share of income from equity investments in the year ended december  was primarily comprised of our proportionate share of the income earned by uktv

accordingly  we reduced the previously established valuation allowance on these net operating loss carryforwards to nil and recorded a federal deferred tax benefit of million 
this change was due to a re assessment of our intentions regarding certain assets during the carryforward period and our judgment that it is more likely than not that these nols will be utilized prior to expiry 
actual realization of these net operating loss carry forwards is dependent upon our ability to generate taxable income from asset sales or operating activities prior to their expiration

our largest infrastructure project was the provision of telecommunication network equipment for heathrow airport s new terminal which contributed million of revenue in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  this contract  however  operated at a lower margin and  consequently  it did not have a significant impact on business segment contribution 
wholesale revenue decreased mainly as a result of the loss of certain lower margin contracts and wholesale voice customers 
business segment contribution for the year ended december   business segment contribution increased to million from million for the year ended december  the increase in segment contribution was due primarily to the result of higher margin retail data contracts and wholesale revenue contracts replacing lower margin voice and infrastructure projects

liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had  million of debt outstanding  compared to  million as of december   and million of cash and cash equivalents  compared to million as of december  the increase in debt from december  is primarily due to movements in exchange rates and  to a lesser extent  an increase in net borrowing 
our business is capital intensive and has significant leverage 
we have significant cash requirements for operating costs  capital expenditures and interest expense 
the level of our capital expenditures and operating expenditures are affected by the significant amounts of capital required to connect customers to our network  expand and upgrade our network and offer new services 
we expect that our cash on hand  together with cash from operations and amounts undrawn on our revolving credit facility  will be sufficient for our cash requirements through december  however  our cash requirements after december  may exceed these sources of cash 
we partially refinanced our senior credit facility and now have no significant principal payments under our senior credit facility until we issued approximately billion equivalent aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes on january   in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to rule a under the securities act  and outside the united states to certain non us persons pursuant to regulation s under the securities act

on october   we entered into conversion hedges with certain counterparties relating to our billion convertible senior notes due these transactions are intended to offset a portion of the dilutive effects that could potentially be associated with conversion of the convertible senior notes at maturity and provide us with the option to receive the number of shares of our common stock or in certain circumstances cash with a value equal to the excess of x the value owed by us up to the cap price of per share to convertible senior note investors pursuant to the terms of the notes on conversion of up to of the notes over y the aggregate face amount of such converted notes upon maturity of the convertible senior notes 
the conversion hedges also provide various mechanisms for settlement in the company s common stock and or cash in certain circumstances  based primarily on the settlement method elected for the notes 
these options have an initial strike price of per share of our stock  which is the conversion price provided under the terms of our convertible senior notes  and a cap price of per share of our stock

our long term debt has been issued by virgin media inc and certain of its subsidiaries that have no independent operations or significant assets other than investments in their respective subsidiaries and affiliates

in addition  the terms of our existing and future indebtedness and the laws of the jurisdictions under which our subsidiaries are organized limit the payment of dividends  loan repayments and other distributions from them under many circumstances 
our debt agreements contain restrictions on our ability to transfer cash between groups of our subsidiaries 
as a result of these restrictions  although our overall liquidity may be sufficient to satisfy our obligations  we may be limited by covenants in some of our debt agreements from transferring cash to other subsidiaries that might require funds 
in addition  cross default provisions in our other indebtedness may be triggered if we default on any of these debt agreements 
we may opportunistically access the loan and debt markets in order to extend debt maturities and to seek improved debt terms

holders of convertible senior notes may tender their notes for conversion at any time on or after august  through to the second scheduled trading date preceding the maturity date 
prior to august   holders may convert their notes  at their option  only under the following circumstances i in any quarter  if the closing sale price of virgin media inc s common stock during at least of the last trading days of the prior quarter was more than of the applicable conversion price per share of common stock on the last day of such prior quarter  ii if  for five consecutive trading days  the trading price per  principal amount of notes was less than of the product of the closing price of our common stock and the then applicable conversion rate  iii if a specified corporate event occurs  such as a merger  recapitalization  reclassification  binding share exchange or conveyance of all  or substantially all  of virgin media inc s assets  iv the declaration by virgin media inc

table of contents common stock  or a combination of both  at our election  to settle our obligations

this condition must be fulfilled on of the last trading days of each calendar quarter

the derivative instruments consist of interest rate swaps  cross currency interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward contracts 
we are also subject to interest rate risks

an increase in interest rates of would increase unhedged gross interest expense by approximately million per year 
we are also subject to currency exchange rate risks because substantially all of our revenues  operating costs and selling  general and administrative expenses are paid in uk pounds sterling  but we pay interest and principal obligations with respect to a portion of our indebtedness in us dollars and euros 
to the extent that the pound sterling declines in value against the us dollar and the euro  the effective cost of servicing our us dollar and euro denominated debt will be higher 
changes in the exchange rate result in foreign currency gains or losses

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
as some of our indebtedness accrues interest at variable rates  we have exposure to volatility in future cash flows and earnings associated with variable interest rate payments 
also  substantially all of our revenues  operating costs and selling  general and administrative expenses are earned and paid in pounds sterling but we pay interest and principal obligations on some of our indebtedness in us dollars and euros 
as of december    million  or  of our indebtedness based upon contractual obligations  was denominated in us dollars and million  or  of our indebtedness based upon contractual obligations  was denominated in euros 
as a result  we have exposure to volatility in future cash flows and earnings associated with changes in foreign exchange rates on payments of principal and interest on a portion of our indebtedness 
we have also committed and forecasted purchases of goods and services in us dollars  euros and south african rand 
to mitigate the risk from these exposures  we have implemented a cash flow hedging program 
the objective of this program is to reduce but not eliminate the volatility of our cash flows and earnings caused by changes in underlying rates 
to achieve this objective we have entered into a number of derivative instruments 
the derivative instruments utilized comprise interest rate swaps  cross currency interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward contracts
