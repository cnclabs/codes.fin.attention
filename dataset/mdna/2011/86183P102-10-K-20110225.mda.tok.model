item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are a global designer and manufacturer of highly engineered electrical and electronic components  modules and systems for the commercial  automotive  agricultural and off highway vehicle markets 
for the year ended december   net sales were million  an increase of million over our net sales for the year ended december  of million 
the increase in our net sales was primarily a result of the significant production volume increases experienced in our served markets during net income for the year ended december  was million  or per diluted share  compared with a net loss of million  or per diluted share  for our results were positively affected by improvements in the north american automotive and north american and european commercial vehicle markets as well as improvements in the global economy as a whole 
production volumes in the north american automotive vehicle market increased by during the year ended december  when compared to the year ended december  this automotive vehicle market production volume increase had a positive effect on our north american automotive vehicle market net sales of approximately million  primarily within our control devices segment 
the commercial vehicle market production volumes in north america improved by during the year ended december  when compared to the prior year  which resulted in increased net sales of approximately million  primarily within our electronics segment 
our net sales were also favorably affected by increased european commercial vehicle production volumes of during the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
this increased production volume had a positive effect on our net sales of approximately million  principally within the electronics segment 
our net sales were further favorably affected by approximately million  primarily within the electronics segment due to production volume increases within the agricultural vehicle market 
our net sales to the agricultural vehicle market as a percentage of total net sales increased from in to for these increases in net sales were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates of approximately million during the year ended december  when compared to the year ended december  our gross margin percentage increased from for the year ended december  to for the current year 
the increase in the current year gross margin percentage is largely a result of our increased sales in while substantially maintaining an overhead structure consistent with our level 
our selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this million  or  increase in sg a was largely due to increased compensation and compensation related expenses 
excluding product development  our compensation and compensation related expenses increased by approximately million from the prior year  primarily as a result of increased incentive compensation expenses 
in addition  our product development costs increased by approximately million between periods due to our support of new product launches by our customers 
during we issued million of senior secured notes with a fixed interest rate of 
we used the proceeds from this issuance and cash on hand to extinguish our million senior notes 
as a result of this extinguishment  we incurred a loss of million  primarily related to the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the extinguished senior notes 
we refinanced this long term liability in order to extend its maturity to october  and to reduce the interest rate on our debt 
for approximately one month during  both the senior secured notes and a portion of the senior notes were outstanding  resulting in duplicate interest of approximately million  which negatively affected our financial results 
this additional interest expense was offset entirely by reduced interest as a result of our lower principle balance  lower interest rate and the effect of our fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement which was entered into during october our results for the year ended december  were also favorably affected by the wind down of our wholly owned subsidiary  stoneridge pollak limited spl  located in mitcheldean  united kingdom 
on february   we placed spl into administration a structured bankruptcy in the united kingdom 
we had previously ceased spl s manufacturing operations in december of  as part of the restructuring initiatives announced in october all spl customer contracts were transferred to our other subsidiaries when we placed spl into administration 
we recognized a net gain within other expense income  net of approximately million  primarily from the reversal of the cumulative translation adjustment account  which had previously been included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders equity 
in addition  we recognized a tax benefit of approximately million from the reversal of deferred tax liabilities  primarily employee benefit related which were also previously included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
at december  and december   we maintained a cash and cash equivalents balance of million and million  respectively 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we have no borrowings under our asset based credit facility the credit facility 
at december  and december   we had borrowing capacity of million and million  respectively 
outlook the north american automotive vehicle market has recovered significantly from levels  which has had a favorable effect on our control devices segment s results 
north american automotive vehicle production was million units for for  this production volume is forecasted to be in the range of million to million units 
if this forecasted increase in production volume occurs  it will favorably affect our control devices segment 
the north american and european commercial vehicle markets that we serve also recovered from levels 
the medium duty truck market  which represents nearly of our sales volume in the north american commercial vehicle market  is forecasted to grow by in  with most of the increase coming in the second half of the year 
in europe  the commercial vehicle market is forecasted to grow by in if these forecasted increases in production volumes occur  they will favorably affect our electronics segment 
agricultural vehicle production increased in when compared to  which favorably affected both our electronics and control devices segments 
we believe that this market will continue to improve during through our restructuring activities initiated in prior years we have been able to reduce our cost structure 
our fixed overhead costs are lower due to the cessation of manufacturing operations at our sarasota  florida and mitcheldean  united kingdom locations 
we were able to maintain our manufacturing capacity in light of these closures by transferring the manufacturing lines to other operating facilities 
as our sales volumes have increased in our operating margin has benefited from our reduced cost structure 
we believe that our results will continue to benefit from these restructuring activities 
as a result of our long term debt refinancing  we expect to reduce our annual interest expense by approximately million 
we believe our interest expense will be further reduced by our fixed to variable interest rate swap 
our results could be unfavorably affected by increased commodity prices  specifically copper 
copper prices increased during and have continued to increase in a portion of our sales will be subject to copper surcharge billings that will mitigate this increase in raw materials 
our results could also be unfavorably affected by foreign currency exchange rates 
we have significant foreign denominated transaction exposure in certain locations especially in mexico and sweden 
during  we experienced component shortages in our supply base  which has had an adverse effect on our results 
continued or escalated component shortages in our supply base may adversely affect our results 
results of operations we are primarily organized by markets served and products produced 
under this organizational structure  our operations have been aggregated into two reportable segments electronics and control devices 
the electronics reportable segment includes results of operations that design and manufacture electronic instrument clusters  electronic control units  driver information systems and electrical distribution systems  primarily wiring harnesses and connectors for electrical power and signal distribution

there were no similar impairment charges taken in equity in earnings of investees 
the decrease in equity earnings of investees was predominately attributable to the decrease in equity earnings recognized from our pst joint venture 
equity earnings for pst declined from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the decrease was caused by a decline in pst s net sales 
income loss before income taxes 
income loss before income taxes is summarized in the following table by reportable segment in thousands dollar increase percent increase years ended december decrease decrease electronics control devices other corporate activities corporate interest expense  net loss before income taxes the decrease in our profitability in the electronics reportable segment was primarily related to the significant decline in net sales  primarily related to volume declines in when compared to volume reductions reduced our net sales within the electronics segment by approximately million for the year ended december  when compared to the year ended december  the decrease in loss before income taxes in the control devices reportable segment was primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge of million recognized in additionally  the control devices segment recognized an additional million of restructuring related expenses in as compared to volume reductions reduced our net sales within the control devices segment by approximately million for the year ended december  when compared to the year ended december  the increase in corporate interest expense  net from to was a result of a lower amount of interest income realized during the year ended december  to offset our interest expense 
the decreased interest income is attributable to lower yields on investments during when compared to the decrease in income before income taxes from other corporate activities was primarily due to a decrease in equity earnings from our pst joint venture of million in when compared to this was partially offset by reduced compensation and compensation related costs recognized during when compared to  due to cost reduction initiatives 
compensation and compensation related costs were approximately million lower in than they were in loss before income taxes by geographic location are summarized in the following table in thousands dollar increase percent years ended december decrease increase north america europe and other nm loss before income taxes nm not meaningful north american loss before income taxes includes interest expense  net of approximately million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
our north american profitability was adversely affected by the million goodwill impairment charge 
excluding the goodwill impairment charge  the decrease in our profitability in north america was primarily attributable to lower commercial and automotive vehicle sales volumes during the year ended december  of approximately million and million  respectively  when compared to the decrease in profitability outside north america was primarily due to lower sales volumes within our european commercial vehicle market of approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  provision benefit for income taxes 
we recognized a provision benefit for income taxes of million  or and million  or of our pre tax net loss  for federal  state and foreign income taxes for and  respectively 
the effective tax rate for decreased compared to primarily as a result of the difference in the amount of valuation allowance recorded against our domestic deferred tax assets 
prior to the company had not provided a valuation allowance against its domestic deferred tax assets  therefore the amount of valuation allowance provided in was based on the total domestic deferred tax asset amount 
the amount of valuation allowance provided in is significantly less than as it relates only to the change in domestic deferred tax assets from to due to the impairment of goodwill in  the company was in a cumulative loss position for the period and has provided a valuation allowance offsetting federal  state and certain foreign net deferred tax assets

liquidity and capital resources summary of cash flows for the years ended december  and in thousands dollar increase decrease net cash provided by used for operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net change in cash and cash equivalents cash provided by operating activities for was consistent with our cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was positively affected by higher net income and accounts payable balances 
this was partially offset by higher accounts receivable and inventory balances 
our higher working capital account balances at december  were attributable to the higher sales volume in the current period 
our receivable terms and collections rates have remained consistent between periods presented 
as our served markets improve we expect that our working capital requirements will continue to increase accordingly 
the increase in net cash used for investing activities reflects an increase in cash used for capital projects of approximately million 
our capital expenditures were historically lower than normal as a result of our customers delaying product launches 
as our served markets continue to improve we expect our future capital expenditures to increase and be more consistent with our historical expenditures 
also  during  we acquired ownership interest in bolton conductive systems  llc bcs at a cost of approximately million 
during the year ended december   we issued million senior secured notes with a fixed interest rate of 
these senior secured notes were issued at a discount to the initial purchasers  which resulted in net proceeds of million from the issuance 
we used the proceeds from this issuance and cash on hand to extinguish our million  senior notes 
we refinanced this long term liability in order to extend its maturity to october  and to reduce the interest rate on the debt 
in conjunction with the senior secured notes issuance  we incurred million of costs  which were capitalized as deferred financing costs at december  as a result of the refinancing  we expect to reduce our annual cash interest by approximately million

the internal revenue code of  as amended  imposes an annual limitation on the ability of a corporation that undergoes an ownership change to use its net operating loss and credit carryforwards to reduce its tax liability 
during the fourth quarter of we undertook a secondary offering 
as a result of the secondary offering a substantial change in our ownership occurred and we may have experienced an ownership change pursuant to section of the internal revenue code of  as revised 
we are in the process of evaluating the secondary offering and the potential impact  if any  on our ability to fully utilize net operating loss and research credit carry forwards 
if it is ultimately determined that we did experience an ownership change  there would not be an impact to the balance sheet and statement of operations as of december  due to us being in a valuation allowance position 
at december   we had a cash and cash equivalents balance of approximately million  of which million was held domestically and million was held in foreign locations 
none of our cash balance was restricted at december  inflation and international presence given the current economic climate and recent fluctuations in certain commodity prices  we believe that an increase in such items could significantly affect our profitability 
furthermore  by operating internationally  we are affected by foreign currency exchange rates and the economic conditions of certain countries 
critical accounting policies and estimates estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate estimates and assumptions used in our financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe the following are critical accounting policies those most important to the financial presentation and those that require the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
revenue recognition and sales commitments 
we recognize revenues from the sale of products  net of actual and estimated returns of products sold based on authorized returns  at the point of passage of title  which is generally at the time of shipment 
we often enter into agreements with our customers at the beginning of a given vehicle s expected production life 
once such agreements are entered into  it is our obligation to fulfill the customers purchasing requirements for the entire production life of the vehicle 
these agreements are subject to renegotiation  which may affect product pricing 
in certain limited instances  we may be committed under existing agreements to supply products to our customers at selling prices which are not sufficient to cover the direct cost to produce such products 
in such situations  we recognize losses immediately 
there were no such significant instances of this in these agreements generally may also be terminated by our customers at any time 
on an ongoing basis  we receive blanket purchase orders from our customers  which include pricing terms 
purchase orders do not always specify quantities 
we recognize revenue based on the pricing terms included in our purchase orders as our products are shipped to our customers 
we are asked to provide our customers with annual cost reductions as part of certain agreements 
in addition  we have ongoing adjustments to our pricing arrangements with our customers based on the related content  the cost of our products and other commercial factors 
such pricing adjustments are recognized as they are negotiated with our customers 
warranties 
our warranty reserve is established based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet dates 
this estimate is based on historical trends of units sold and payment amounts  combined with our current understanding of the status of existing claims 
to estimate the warranty reserve  we are required to forecast the resolution of existing claims as well as expected future claims on products previously sold 
although we believe that our warranty reserve is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate  such amounts estimated to be due and payable could differ materially from what will actually transpire in the future 
our customers are increasingly seeking to hold suppliers responsible for product warranties  which could negatively impact our exposure to these costs 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we have concentrations of sales and trade receivable balances with a few key customers 
therefore  it is critical that we evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet their financial obligations  a specific allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
additionally  we review historical trends for collectability in determining an estimate for our allowance for doubtful accounts 
if economic circumstances change substantially  estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to the company could be reduced by a material amount 
we do not have collateral requirements with our customers 
contingencies 
we are subject to legal proceedings and claims  including product liability claims  commercial or contractual disputes  environmental enforcement actions and other claims that arise in the normal course of business 
we routinely assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters  as well as ranges of probable losses  by consulting with internal personnel principally involved with such matters and with our outside legal counsel handling such matters 
we have accrued for estimated losses when it is probable that a liability or loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
contingencies by their nature relate to uncertainties that require the exercise of judgment both in assessing whether or not a liability or loss has been incurred and estimating that amount of probable loss 
the reserves may change in the future due to new developments or changes in circumstances 
the inherent uncertainty related to the outcome of these matters can result in amounts materially different from any provisions made with respect to their resolution 
inventory valuation 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the last in  first out method for us inventories and by the first in  first out method for non us inventories 
where appropriate  standard cost systems are utilized for purposes of determining cost and the standards are adjusted as necessary to ensure they approximate actual costs 
estimates of the lower of cost or market value of inventory are determined based upon current economic conditions  historical sales quantities and patterns and  in some cases  the specific risk of loss on specifically identified inventories 
we adjust our excess and obsolescence reserve at least on a quarterly basis 
excess inventories are quantities of items that exceed anticipated sales or usage for a reasonable period 
we have guidelines for calculating provisions for excess inventories based on the number of months of inventories on hand compared to anticipated sales or usage 
goodwill 
goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the valuation methodologies employed by the company use subjective measures including forward looking financial information and discount rates that directly impact the resulting fair values used to test the company s business units for impairment 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for more information on our application of this accounting standard  including the valuation techniques used to determine the fair value of goodwill 
share based compensation 
the estimate for our share based compensation expense involves a number of assumptions 
we believe each assumption used in the valuation is reasonable because it takes into account the experience of the plan and reasonable expectations 
we estimate volatility and forfeitures based on historical data  future expectations and the expected term of the share based compensation awards 
the assumptions  however  involve inherent uncertainties 
as a result  if other assumptions had been used  share based compensation expense could have varied 
deferred income taxes 
deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences between amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the basis of such assets and liabilities as measured by tax laws and regulations 
our deferred tax assets include  among other items  net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits that can be used to offset taxable income in future periods and reduce income taxes payable in those future periods 
these deferred tax assets will begin to expire  if unused  no later than and  respectively 
statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes accounting standards codification tm asc topic  requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on all available evidence  it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods 
this assessment requires significant judgment  and in making this evaluation  the company considers available positive and negative evidence  including past results  the existence of cumulative losses in recent periods  our forecast of taxable income for the current year and future years and tax planning strategies 
during the fourth quarter of  the company concluded that it was no longer more likely than not that we would realize our us deferred tax assets 
as a result we provided a full valuation allowance  net of certain future reversing taxable temporary differences  with respect to our us deferred tax assets 
this conclusion did not change for and to the extent that realization of a portion or all of the tax assets becomes more likely than not to be realized based on changes in circumstances a reversal of that portion of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance will be recorded 
the company does not provide deferred income taxes on unremitted earnings of certain non us subsidiaries  which are deemed permanently reinvested 
restructuring 
we have recorded restructuring charges in prior periods in connection with improving manufacturing efficiency and cost position by transferring production to other locations 
these charges are recorded when management has committed to a plan and incurred a liability related to the plan 
also in connection with this initiative  we recorded liabilities for severance costs 
no fixed asset impairment charges were incurred because assets are primarily being transferred to our other locations for continued production 
estimates for work force reductions and other costs savings are recorded based upon estimates of the number of positions to be terminated  termination benefits to be provided and other information as necessary 
management evaluates the estimates on a quarterly basis and will adjust the reserve when information indicates that the estimate is above or below the initial estimate 
for further discussion of our restructuring activities  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
recently issued accounting standards new accounting standards implemented in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb revised the authoritative guidance for determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity vie 
in december  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 improvements to financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities  which provides amendments to accounting standards codification topic no 
 consolidation asc topic to reflect the revised guidance 
among other things  the new guidance requires a qualitative rather than a quantitative assessment to determine the primary beneficiary of a vie based on whether the entity i has the power to direct matters that most significantly impact the activities of the vie and ii has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie 
in addition  the amended guidance requires an ongoing reconsideration of the primary beneficiary 
the provisions of this new guidance were effective as of january   and the adoption did not have an impact on our financial statements 
we analyzed our joint ventures in accordance with asc topic to determine whether they are vie s and  if so  whether we are the primary beneficiary 
both of our joint ventures at december  were determined under the provisions of asc topic to be unconsolidated joint ventures and were accounted for under the equity method of accounting

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk from time to time  we are exposed to certain market risks  primarily resulting from the effects of changes in interest rates 
the face amount of our senior secured notes was million at december  we currently have no amounts outstanding on our revolving credit facility 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  the company entered into a fixed to floating interest rate swap agreement the swap with a notional amount of million to hedge its exposure to fair value fluctuations on a portion of its senior secured notes 
the swap was designated as a fair value hedge of the fixed interest rate obligation under the company s million senior secured notes due october  under the swap  the company pays a variable interest rate equal to the six month london interbank offered rate libor plus and it receives a fixed interest rate of 
the swap requires semi annual settlements on april and october  beginning on april  the critical terms of the swap are aligned with the terms of the senior secured notes  including maturity of october   resulting in no hedge ineffectiveness 
a hypothetical favorable or adverse change in the libor would not significantly affect our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
commodity price risk given the current economic climate and recent fluctuations in certain commodity costs  we currently are experiencing an increased risk  particularly with respect to the purchase of copper  zinc  resins and certain other commodities 
in the past  we managed this risk through a combination of fixed price agreements  staggered short term contract maturities and commercial negotiations with our suppliers 
in the future if we believe that the terms of a fixed price agreement become beneficial to us  we will enter into another such instrument 
we have sought to alleviate the impact of increasing costs by including a material pass through provision in our customer contracts whenever possible 
we may also consider pursuing alternative commodities or alternative suppliers to mitigate this risk over a period of time 
the recent increase in certain commodity costs has negatively affected our operating results 
in june  we entered into a fixed price swap contract for million pounds of copper  which lasted through december we do not currently have commodity contracts in place  but continue to monitor the fixed price commodity market and will pursue a contract if we believe that the terms of the contract become beneficial to us 
the purpose of this contract was to reduce our price risk as it relates to copper prices 
foreign currency exchange risk we use derivative financial instruments  including foreign currency forward contracts  to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by reducing the effect of such fluctuations on foreign currency denominated intercompany transactions and other foreign currency exposures 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts that had a notional value of million as of december  the purpose of these foreign currency contracts is to reduce exposure related to our euro and swedish krona denominated receivables 
the estimated fair value of these contracts at december   per quoted market sources  was approximately million 
these foreign currency option contracts expire during we do not expect the effects of this risk to be material in the future based on the current operating and economic conditions in the countries in which we operate 
a hypothetical pre tax gain loss in fair value from a favorable or adverse change in quoted currency exchange rates would be approximately million or million for our euro and swedish krona denominated receivables  as of december  it is important to note that gains and losses indicated in the sensitivity analysis would generally be offset by gains and losses on the underlying exposures being hedged 
therefore  a hypothetical pre tax gain or loss in fair value from a favorable or adverse change in quoted foreign currencies would not significantly affect our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
we have significant operations in foreign locations 
as a result we are subject to the risk of price fluctuations due to the effects of exchange rates on net sales  operating costs  assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  particularly the mexican peso  euro  swedish krona and british pound 
we do not currently have foreign currency contracts in place to hedge operating activities  but continue to monitor the foreign currency exchange market and will pursue a contract if we believe that the terms of the contract become beneficial to us 
we estimate that a hypothetical favorable or adverse change of the us dollar relative to other currencies in would have a pre tax translation favorable unfavorable effect of million or million as of december
