item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
forward looking statements this document contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of that are not historical in nature and typically address future or anticipated events  trends  expectations or beliefs with respect to our financial condition  results of operations or business 
forward looking statements often contain words such as believes  expects  anticipates  foresees  forecasts  estimates  plans  intends  continues  may  will  should  projects  might  could or other similar words or phrases 
similarly  statements that describe our business strategy  outlook  objectives  plans  intentions or goals also are forward looking statements 
we believe there is a reasonable basis for our forward looking statements  but they are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results could differ materially from the expectations and beliefs reflected in the forward looking statements 
we presently consider the following to be among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and beliefs changes in the budgets or regulatory environments of our customers  primarily local and state governments  that could negatively impact information technology spending  our ability to achieve our financial forecasts due to various factors  including project delays by our customers  reductions in transaction size  fewer transactions  delays in delivery of new products or releases or a decline in our renewal rates for service agreements  economic  political and market conditions  including the global economic and financial crisis  and the general tightening of access to debt or equity capital  technological and market risks associated with the development of new products or services or of new versions of existing or acquired products or services  our ability to successfully complete acquisitions and achieve growth or operational synergies through the integration of acquired businesses  while avoiding unanticipated costs and disruptions to existing operations  competition in the industry in which we conduct business and the impact of competition on pricing  customer retention and pressure for new products or services  the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and dealing with the loss or retirement of key members of management or other key personnel  and costs of compliance and any failure to comply with government and stock exchange regulations 
a detailed discussion of these factors and other risks that affect our business are described in item a  risk factors 
we expressly disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise our forward looking statements 
overview general we provide integrated information management solutions and services for the public sector  with a focus on local governments 
we develop and market a broad line of software products and services to address the information technology it needs of cities  counties  schools and other local government entities 
in addition  we provide professional it services to our customers  including software and hardware installation  data conversion  training and for certain customers  product modifications  along with continuing maintenance and support for customers using our systems 
we also provide subscription based services such as hosted solutions as well as property appraisal outsourcing services for taxing jurisdictions 
our products generally automate three major functional areas financial management and education  courts and justice and property appraisal and tax and we report our results in two segments 
the enterprise software solutions ess segment provides municipal and county governments and schools with software systems to meet their information technology and automation needs for mission critical back office functions such as financial management and courts and justice processes 
the appraisal and tax software solutions and services atss segment provides systems and software that automate the appraisal and assessment of real and personal property as well as property appraisal outsourcing services for local governments and taxing authorities 
property appraisal outsourcing services include the physical inspection of commercial and residential properties  data collection and processing  computer analysis for property valuation  preparation of tax rolls  community education  and arbitration between taxpayers and the assessing jurisdiction 
we monitor and analyze several key performance indicators in order to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance 
these indicators include the following revenues we derive our revenues from five primary sources sale of software licenses  subscription based services  software services  maintenance and support  and appraisal services 
because the majority of the software we sell is off the shelf  increased sales of software products generally result in incrementally higher gross margins 
thus  the most significant driver to our business is the number and size of software license sales 
in addition  new software license sales generally 
table of contents generate implementation services revenues as well as future maintenance and support revenues  which are a recurring revenue source 
we also monitor our customer base and churn since our maintenance and support revenue should increase due to our historically low customer turnover 
during  approximately of our revenue was attributable to ongoing support and maintenance agreements and our customer turnover was approximately 
cost of revenues and gross margins our primary cost component is personnel expenses in connection with providing software implementation  subscription based services  maintenance and support  and appraisal services to our customers 
we can improve gross margins by controlling headcount and related costs and by expanding our revenue base  especially from those products and services that produce incremental revenue with minimal incremental cost  such as software licenses  subscription based services  and maintenance and support 
our appraisal projects are seasonal in nature  and we often employ appraisal personnel on a short term basis to coincide with the life of a project 
as of december   our total employee count increased to  from  at december  most of these additions were to our appraisal staff which is cyclical and in part driven by statutory revaluation cycles in various states 
additions to our appraisal staff were offset somewhat by a smaller implementation and support staff as we manage costs and staff to ensure they are in line with demand in professional services 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses the primary components of sg a expenses are administrative and sales personnel salaries and commissions  marketing expense  share based compensation expense  rent and professional fees 
sales commissions typically fluctuate with revenues and share based compensation expense generally increases when the market price of our stock increases 
other administrative expenses tend to grow at a slower rate than revenues 
liquidity and cash flows the primary driver of our cash flows is net income 
uses of cash include acquisitions  capital investments in property and equipment and discretionary purchases of treasury stock 
in  we purchased million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of million 
during we used cash of million to acquire one company and invested million in property and equipment 
our investment in property and equipment included million related to construction of an office building 
we also borrowed million on our revolving line of credit mainly to assist in funding discretionary purchases of treasury stock 
our working capital needs are fairly stable throughout the year with the significant components of cash outflows being payment of personnel expenses offset by cash inflows representing collection of accounts receivable and cash receipts from customers in advance of revenue being earned 
balance sheet cash  accounts receivable and days sales outstanding and deferred revenue balances are important indicators of our business 
acquisitions in january we acquired all the assets of wiznet  inc wiznet for a cash purchase price of million 
wiznet provides electronic document filing solutions for courts and law offices throughout the united states and is integrated with our primary courts and justice solution 
in connection with this transaction we acquired total tangible assets of approximately  we recorded goodwill of approximately million  all of which is expected to be deductible for tax purposes  and other intangible assets of approximately million 
the million of intangible assets is attributable to customer relationships and acquired software that will be amortized over a weighted average period of approximately nine years 
our balance sheet as of december  reflects the allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
the operating results of this acquisition are included in our results of operations since the date of acquisition 
outlook consistent with  we expect to continue to invest aggressively in product development in we believe that our competitive position is strong and that we are well positioned to take advantage of an eventual return to a stronger economic environment 
however  until we see signs of sustained improvement  we expect that the new business environment in will continue to be both challenging and unpredictable  and that growth will again come primarily from recurring revenues 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  the reported amounts of revenues  cost of revenues and expenses during the reporting period  and related disclosure of contingencies 
the notes to the financial statements included as part of this annual report describe our significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements 
significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the application of the percentage of completion and proportionate performance methods of revenue recognition  the carrying amount and estimated useful lives of intangible assets  determination of share based compensation expense and valuation allowance for receivables 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues in accordance with the provisions of accounting standards codification asc  revenue recognition and asc  software revenue recognition 
our revenues are derived from sales of software licenses  subscription based services  appraisal services  maintenance and support  and services that typically range from installation  training and basic consulting to software modification and customization to meet specific customer needs 
for multiple element software arrangements  which do not entail the performance of services that are considered essential to the functionality of the software  we generally record revenue when the delivered products or performed services result in a legally enforceable and non refundable claim 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts and sales adjustments  which are provided at the time the revenue is recognized 
because most of our customers are governmental entities  we rarely incur a loss resulting from the inability of a customer to make required payments 
in a limited number of cases  we encounter a customer who is dissatisfied with some aspect of the software product or our service  and we may offer a concession to such customer 
in those limited situations where we grant a concession  we rarely reduce the contract arrangement fee  but alternatively may perform additional services  such as additional training or creating additional custom reports 
these amounts have historically been nominal 
in connection with our customer contracts and the adequacy of related allowances and measures of progress towards contract completion  our project managers are charged with the responsibility to continually review the status of each customer on a specific contract basis 
also  we review  on at least a quarterly basis  significant past due accounts receivable and the adequacy of related reserves 
events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount for the allowances for doubtful accounts and sales adjustments may require revision  include  but are not limited to  deterioration of a customer s financial condition  failure to manage our customer s expectations regarding the scope of the services to be delivered  and defects or errors in new versions or enhancements of our software products 
we use contract accounting  primarily the percentage of completion method  as discussed in asc  construction type and certain production type contracts  for those software arrangements that involve significant production  modification or customization of the software  or where our software services are otherwise considered essential to the functionality of the software 
we measure progress to completion primarily using labor hours incurred  or value added 
in addition  we recognize revenue using the proportionate performance method of revenue recognition for our property appraisal projects  some of which can range up to five years 
these methods rely on estimates of total expected contract revenue  billings and collections and expected contract costs  as well as measures of progress toward completion 
we believe reasonably dependable estimates of revenue and costs and progress applicable to various stages of a contract can be made 
at times  we perform additional and or non contractual services for little to no incremental fee to satisfy customer expectations 
if changes occur in delivery  productivity or other factors used in developing our estimates of expected costs or revenues  we revise our cost and revenue estimates  and any revisions are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to that revision first become known 
in connection with these and certain other contracts  we may perform the work prior to when the services are billable and or payable pursuant to the contract 
the termination clauses in most of our contracts provide for the payment for the fair value of products delivered and services performed in the event of an early termination 
for asp and other hosting arrangements  we evaluate whether the customer has the contractual right to take possession of our software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty and whether the customer can feasibly maintain the software on the customer s hardware or enter into another arrangement with a third party to host the software 
if we determine that the customer has the contractual right to take possession of our software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty 
table of contents and can feasibly maintain the software on the customer s hardware or enter into another arrangement with a third party to host the software  we recognize the license  professional services and hosting services revenues pursuant to asc  software revenue recognition 
for asp and other hosting arrangements that do not meet the criteria for recognition under asc  we account for the elements under asc  multiple element arrangements using all applicable facts and circumstances  including whether i the element has stand alone value  ii there is a general right of return and iii the revenue is contingent on delivery of other elements 
we allocate revenue to each element of the arrangement that qualifies for treatment as a separate element based on vsoe  and if vsoe is not available  third party evidence  and if third party evidence is unavailable  estimated selling price 
for professional services associated with asp and hosting arrangements that we determine do not have stand alone value to the customer or are contingent on delivery of other elements  we recognize the services revenue ratably over the remaining contractual period once hosting has gone live and we may begin billing for the hosting services 
we record amounts that have been invoiced in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenues  depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met 
in connection with certain of our contracts  we have recorded retentions receivable or unbilled receivables consisting of costs and estimated profit in excess of billings as of the balance sheet date 
many of the contracts which give rise to unbilled receivables at a given balance sheet date are subject to billings in the subsequent accounting period 
management reviews unbilled receivables and related contract provisions to ensure we are justified in recognizing revenue prior to billing the customer and that we have objective evidence which allows us to recognize such revenue 
in addition  we have a sizable amount of deferred revenue which represents billings in excess of revenue earned 
the majority of this liability consists of maintenance billings for which payments are made in advance and the revenue is ratably earned over the maintenance period  generally one year 
we also have deferred revenue for those contracts in which we receive a deposit and the conditions in which to record revenue for the service or product has not been met 
on a periodic basis  we review by customer the detail components of our deferred revenue to ensure our accounting remains appropriate 
intangible assets and goodwill 
our business acquisitions typically result in the creation of goodwill and other intangible asset balances  and these balances affect the amount and timing of future period amortization expense  as well as expense we could possibly incur as a result of an impairment charge 
the cost of acquired companies is allocated to identifiable tangible and intangible assets based on estimated fair value  with the excess allocated to goodwill 
accordingly  we have a significant balance of acquisition date intangible assets  including software  customer related intangibles  trade name and goodwill 
in addition  we capitalize software development costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility 
these intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
all intangible assets with definite and indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of goodwill is generally measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to its fair value  generally determined by estimated future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually as of april  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset s fair value 
the fair values calculated in our impairment tests are determined using discounted cash flow models involving several assumptions 
these assumptions include  but are not limited to  anticipated operating income growth rates  our long term anticipated operating income growth rate and the discount rate 
our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 
the assumptions that are used are based upon what we believe a hypothetical marketplace participant would use in estimating fair value 
we have identified two reporting units for impairment testing 
our reporting units are the same as our reportable segments and consistent with the reporting units tested for impairment in prior years 
assets  liabilities and goodwill have been assigned to reporting units based on assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition 
we evaluate the reasonableness of the fair value calculations of our reporting units by comparing the total of the fair value of all of our reporting units to our total market capitalization 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
recoverability of other intangible assets is generally measured by comparison of the carrying amount to estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
the assessment of recoverability or of the estimated useful life for amortization purposes will be affected if the timing or the amount of estimated future operating cash flows is not achieved 
such indicators may include  among others a significant decline in expected future cash flows  a sustained  significant decline in stock price and market capitalization  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  unanticipated competition  and reductions in growth rates 
in addition  products  capabilities  or technologies developed by others may render our software products obsolete or non competitive 
any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of goodwill or other intangible assets 
our annual goodwill impairment analysis  which we performed during the second quarter of  did not result in an impairment charge 
during we did not identify any triggering events which would require an update to our annual impairment review 
a 
table of contents hypothetical decrease in the fair value of either of our reporting units as of december  would have had no impact on the carrying value of our goodwill 
share based compensation 
we have a stock option plan that provides for the grant of stock options to key employees  directors and non employee consultants 
we estimate the fair value of share based awards on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model 
share based compensation expense includes the estimated effects of forfeitures  which will be adjusted over the requisite service period to the extent actual forfeitures differ  or are expected to differ from such estimates 
changes in estimated forfeitures are recognized in the period of change and will also impact the amount of expense to be recognized in future periods 
forfeiture rate assumptions are derived from historical data 
we estimate stock price volatility at the date of grant based on the historical volatility of our common stock 
estimated option life is determined using the simplified method in accordance with asc  stock compensation 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment  including estimating stock price volatility  expected option life and forfeiture rates

table of contents compared to revenues software licenses 
the following table sets forth a comparison of our software license revenues for the years ended december change in thousands enterprise software solutions appraisal and tax software solutions and services total software license revenues in we signed large new contracts with average software license fees of approximately  compared to large new contracts signed in with average software license fees of approximately  we consider contracts with a license fee component of  or more to be large 
although a contract is signed in a particular year  the year in which the revenue is recognized may be different because we recognize revenue according to our revenue recognition policy as described in note in the notes to financial statements 
in  ess software license revenues recognized declined substantially compared to the prior year period 
the decrease in software license revenues is mainly attributable to longer sales cycles to negotiate and close contracts that have reached the request for proposal phase and postponement of customer purchasing decisions mainly due to budgetary constraints related to economic conditions 
the software installation period for a substantial number of our ess solutions is relatively short and delays in the timing of signing new contracts will impact our results in the short term 
in addition  a portion of the decline was due to a number of customers choosing our subscription based options  rather than purchasing the software under a traditional perpetual software license arrangement 
subscription based arrangements result in lower software license revenues in the initial year as compared to traditional perpetual software license arrangements but generate higher overall subscription based services revenue over the term of the contract 
we expect ess software license revenues in to be flat compared to atss software license revenue is substantially dependent on revaluation cycles which are cyclical and in part driven by statutory revaluation cycles in various states 
in addition  local government taxing authorities generally do not purchase a new software license for each revaluation cycle 
subscriptions 
the following table sets forth a comparison of our subscription revenues for the years ended december change in thousands enterprise software solutions appraisal and tax software solutions and services total subscription revenues subscription based services revenue primarily consists of revenues derived from application service provider asp arrangements and other hosted service offerings  software subscriptions and disaster recovery services 
in january  we acquired wiznet  which provides primarily subscription based electronic document filing solutions for courts and law offices and is included in our ess segment 
excluding the impact of this acquisition  ess and total subscription revenues grew by in asp and other software subscription agreements are typically for periods of three to six years and automatically renew unless either party cancels the agreement 
disaster recovery and miscellaneous other hosted service agreements are typically 
table of contents renewable annually 
existing customers who converted to our asp model as well as new customers for asp and other hosted service offerings provided the majority of the subscription revenue increase with the remaining increase due to slightly higher rates for disaster recovery services 
in  existing customers elected to transfer to our asp model and we added new customers 
software services 
the following table sets forth a comparison of our software services revenues for the years ended december change in thousands enterprise software solutions appraisal and tax software solutions and services total software services revenues software services revenues primarily consists of professional services billed in connection with the installation of our software  conversion of customer data  training customer personnel and consulting 
new customers who purchase our proprietary software licenses generally also contract with us to provide for the related software services as well 
existing customers also periodically purchase additional training  consulting and minor programming services 
the decline in software services revenues in is principally due to lower new software license contract activity in recent quarters due to weak economic conditions 
in addition  the increase in the mix of customers choosing our subscription based solutions was a factor in lower software services revenues 
maintenance 
the following table sets forth a comparison of our maintenance revenues for the years ended december change in thousands enterprise software solutions appraisal and tax software solutions and services total maintenance revenues we provide maintenance and support services for our software products and third party software 
maintenance revenues increased in compared to this increase was due to growth in our installed customer base and slightly higher maintenance rates on most of our product lines 
our annual maintenance and support growth rate has declined compared to previous year s growth rate due to a number of customers converting to asp arrangements as well as new customers choosing our subscription based options  rather than purchasing the software under a traditional perpetual software license arrangement

table of contents appraisal services revenue increased in compared to the appraisal services business is somewhat cyclical and driven in part by statutory revaluation cycles in various states 
we substantially completed several large appraisal projects mid we began several new revaluation contracts in late which contributed to the revenue growth in we expect appraisal revenues for will be moderately higher than cost of revenues and gross margins the following table sets forth a comparison of the key components of our cost of revenues for the years ended december change in thousands software licenses acquired software software services  maintenance and subscriptions appraisal services hardware and other total cost of revenues the following table sets forth a comparison of gross margin percentage by revenue type for the years ended december change gross margin percentage software license and acquired software software services  maintenance and subscriptions appraisal services hardware and other overall gross margin software license and acquired software 
cost of software license and acquired software is comprised of third party software costs  amortization of acquired software and amortization expense for capitalized development costs on certain software products 
cost of third party software comprised approximately of our cost of software license revenues in compared to approximately of our cost of software license in third party software sales declined due to lower proprietary software sales 
new software license sales are a significant driver of third party license sales 
costs of acquired software comprises approximately of our cost of software license revenues in compared to approximately of our cost of software license in cost of acquired software includes amortization expense for software acquired through acquisitions 
we completed several acquisitions in the period through and these costs are being amortized over a weighted average period of approximately five years 
the balance is made up of amortization of capitalized development costs on other software products 
amortization expense for capitalized development cost is determined on a product by product basis at an annual rate not less than straight line basis over the product s estimated life  which is generally five years 
development costs consist mainly of personnel costs  such as salary and benefits paid to our developers  and rent for related office space 
we did not capitalize any internal software development costs in or in  our software license gross margin percentage increased compared to the prior year period because our product mix included less third party software 
third party software has a lower gross margin than proprietary software solutions 
software services  maintenance and subscription based services 
cost of software services  maintenance and subscriptions primarily consists of personnel costs related to installation of our software  conversion of customer data  training customer personnel and support activities and various other services such as asp and disaster recovery 
in  the software services  maintenance and subscriptions gross margin increased compared to the prior year partly because maintenance and various other services such as asp and disaster recovery costs typically grow at a slower rate than related revenues due to leverage in the utilization of our support and maintenance staff and economies of scale  as well as annual rate increases on certain services 
we are also managing costs and staff levels to ensure they are in line with demand for professional services 
our implementation and support staff has declined by employees since december  
table of contents appraisal services 
our appraisal services gross margin declined compared to our appraisal services gross margin in included the positive impact of cost savings and operational efficiencies experienced on an unusually complex reappraisal project that ended in mid in addition  a high proportion of the costs of appraisal services revenue are variable  as we often hire temporary employees to assist in appraisal projects whose term of employment generally ends with the projects completion 
our blended gross margin for increased compared to due to lower third party software expense which offset the impact of a revenue mix that included less software license revenues 
the gross margin also benefited from leverage in the utilization of our support and maintenance staff and economies of scale and slightly higher rates on certain services 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses consist primarily of salaries  employee benefits  travel  share based compensation expense  commissions and related overhead costs for administrative and sales and marketing employees as well as  professional fees  trade show activities  advertising costs and other marketing related costs 
the following table sets forth a comparison of our sg a expenses for the following years ended december change in thousands selling  general and administrative expenses sg a expenses declined in compared to due to lower commission costs and marketing expenses which were offset somewhat by higher share based compensation expense 
marketing expenses in include costs associated with the launch of a new corporate branding initiative 
research and development expense research and development expense consists primarily of salaries  employee benefits and related overhead costs associated with product development and enhancements and upgrades provided to existing customers under maintenance plans 
the following table sets forth a comparison of our research and development expense for the following years ended december change in thousands research and development expense research and development expense consists of costs associated with development of new products and new software platforms from which we do not currently generate revenue 
these include the microsoft dynamics ax project  as well as other new product development efforts 
in approximately two thirds of the increase in gross research and development expense relates to investments in new product development other than microsoft dynamics ax 
we have increased our research and development efforts as we continue to make investments in existing and new products that we believe will enhance our competitive position and drive long term revenue growth 
we have increased our development staff by employees since december  in january  we entered into a software development and license agreement  which provides for a strategic alliance with microsoft corporation microsoft to jointly develop core public sector functionality for microsoft dynamics ax to address the accounting needs of public sector organizations worldwide 
in september  tyler and microsoft signed an amendment to the software development and license agreement  which grants microsoft intellectual property rights in and to certain portions of the software code provided and developed by tyler into microsoft dynamics ax products to be marketed and sold outside of the public sector in exchange for reimbursement payments to partially offset the research and development costs 
in and  we offset our research and development expense by million and million  respectively  which were the amounts earned under the terms of our agreement with microsoft 
in september  tyler and microsoft signed a statement of work under the amended software development and license agreement for which we expected to recognize offsets to our research and development expense by approximately  each quarter through the end of in addition  in october  the scope of the project was further expanded which will result in additional offsets to research and development expense  varying in amount from quarter to quarter through mid for a total of approximately million 
as of december   we have received 
table of contents million and expect to receive the remaining million through mid the actual amount and timing of future research and development costs and related reimbursements and whether they are capitalized or expensed may vary 
we currently expect that for  we will recognize less reimbursement from microsoft than we did in due to changes in the timing of deployment of resources 
amortization of customer and trade name intangibles acquisition intangibles are comprised of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible assets acquired that is allocated to acquired software and customer and trade name intangibles 
the remaining excess purchase price is allocated to goodwill that is not subject to amortization 
amortization expense related to acquired software is included with cost of revenues  while amortization expense of customer and trade name intangibles is recorded as other operating expense 
the estimated useful lives of both customer and trade name intangibles are five to years 
the following table sets forth a comparison of amortization of customer and trade name intangibles for the following years ended december change in thousands amortization of customer and trade name intangibles in january we completed one acquisition  which increased amortizable customer and trade name intangibles by approximately million

table of contents income tax provision the following table sets forth a comparison of our income tax provision for the following years ended december change in thousands income tax provision effective income tax rate our effective income tax rate declined compared to mainly due to a  research and development tax credit in in addition to the impact of the research and development tax credit in  the effective income tax rate for both years were different from the statutory united states federal income tax rate of due to state income taxes  non deductible share based compensation expense  the qualified manufacturing activities deduction  and non deductible meals and entertainment costs 
approximately of our stock option expense is derived from incentive stock options isos 
as such  a tax benefit is not recorded at the time the compensation cost related to the options is recorded for book purposes due to the fact that an iso does not ordinarily result in a tax benefit unless there is a disqualifying disposition 
non qualified stock options result in the creation of a deferred tax asset  which is a temporary difference  until the time that the option is exercised 
due to the treatment of isos for tax purposes  our effective tax rate from year to year is subject to variability 
compared to revenues software licenses 
the following table sets forth a comparison of our software license revenues for the years ended december change in thousands enterprise software solutions appraisal and tax software solutions and services total software license revenues we acquired several student information and financial management solutions for k schools from january through august excluding the impact of these acquisitions  ess software license revenue would have declined approximately  in mid our sales cycle to negotiate and close contracts which have reached the request for proposal phase lengthened slightly mainly due to budgetary constraints related to declining economic conditions 
as a result the purchasing processes for some of our customers were extended to include more approval and documentation requirements 
in addition  a few contracts included requirements to construct interfaces to existing systems or other essential functionality which results in recognizing revenue over a longer period of time 
atss software license revenue is substantially dependent on revaluation cycles which are cyclical and in part driven by statutory revaluation cycles in various states 
in addition  local government taxing authorities generally do not purchase a new software license for each revaluation cycle

financial condition and liquidity as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and current and non current investments of million  compared to cash and cash equivalents including restricted cash equivalents of million and current and non current investments of million at december  as of december   we had million outstanding borrowings and outstanding letters of credit totaling million to secure surety bonds required by some of our customer contracts 
these letters of credit expire through mid the following table sets forth a summary of cash flows for the years ended december in thousands cash flows provided by used by operating activities investing activities financing activities net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents net cash provided by operating activities continues to be our primary source of funds to finance operating needs and capital expenditures 
other capital resources include cash on hand  public and private issuances of debt and equity securities  and bank borrowings 
it is possible that our ability to access the capital and credit markets in the future may be limited by economic conditions or other factors 
we currently believe that cash provided by operating activities  cash on hand and available credit are sufficient to fund our working capital requirements  capital expenditures  income tax obligations  and share repurchases for the foreseeable future 

table of contents in  operating activities provided net cash of million  primarily generated from net income of million  non cash depreciation and amortization charges of million  non cash share based compensation expense of million offset by an increase in working capital of million 
the increase in working capital was due to lower accounts payable and accrued liabilities pertaining to the timing of payments on vendor invoices and income tax liabilities

in addition  accrued bonus liabilities are smaller in compared to as a result of financial performance 
our accounts receivable and deferred revenue balances were also higher than due to an increase in annual software maintenance billings as a result of growth in our installed customer base 
in general  changes in the balance of deferred revenue are cyclical and primarily driven by the timing of our maintenance renewal billings 
our renewal dates occur throughout the year but our heaviest renewal cycles occur in the second and fourth quarters 
non current investments available for sale consist of two auction rate municipal securities ars which are collateralized debt obligations supported by municipal agencies and do not include mortgage backed securities 
short term investments available for sale consists of a portion of one of these ars which was partially redeemed at par during the period january  through february  these ars are debt instruments with stated maturities ranging from to years  for which the interest rate is designed to be reset through dutch auctions approximately every days 
however  due to events in the credit markets  auctions for these securities have not occurred since february both of our ars have had very small partial redemptions at par in the period from july through february as of december  we have continued to earn and collect interest on both of our ars 
because quoted prices in active markets are no longer available we determined the estimated fair values of these securities utilizing a discounted trinomial model 
the model considers the probability of three potential occurrences for each auction event through the maturity date of each ars 
the three potential outcomes for each auction are i successful auction early redemption  ii failed auction and iii issuer default 
inputs in determining the probabilities of the potential outcomes include but are not limited to  the securities collateral  credit rating  insurance  issuer s financial standing  contractual restrictions on disposition and the liquidity in the market 
the fair value of each ars is determined by summing the present value of the probability weighted future principal and interest payments determined by the model 
since there can be no assurances that auctions for these securities will be successful in the near future  we have classified our ars as non current investments 
in association with this estimate of fair value  we have recorded an after tax temporary unrealized gain on our non current ars of  net of related tax effects of  in  which is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our balance sheet 
we consider the impairment in our ars as temporary because we do not have the intent to sell  nor is it more likely than not that we will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their cost basis 
we believe that this temporary decline in fair value is due entirely to liquidity issues  because the underlying assets of these securities are supported by municipal agencies and do not include mortgage backed securities  have redemption features which call for redemption at of par value and have a current credit rating of a or aa 
the ratings on the ars take into account credit support through insurance policies guaranteeing each of the bonds payment of principal and accrued interest  if it becomes necessary 
in addition  both ars have had very small partial redemptions at par in the period july through february based on our cash and cash equivalents balance of million  expected operating cash flows and a million revolving credit line  we do not believe a lack of liquidity associated with our ars will adversely affect our ability to conduct business  and believe we have the ability to hold the securities throughout the currently estimated recovery period 
we will continue to evaluate any changes in the fair value of our ars and in the future  depending upon existing market conditions  we may be required to record an other than temporary decline in market value 
at december   our days sales outstanding dsos were days compared to dsos of days at december  dsos are calculated based on accounts receivable excluding long term receivables  but including unbilled receivables divided by the quotient of annualized quarterly revenues divided by days

the first change relates to the determination of when the individual deliverables included in a multiple element arrangement may be treated as separate units of accounting 
the second change modifies the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across the separately identified deliverables 
together  these changes will result in earlier recognition of service revenue for certain of our asp and hosting arrangements than under previous guidance
