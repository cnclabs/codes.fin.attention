executive overview nfp and its benefits  insurance and wealth management businesses provide a full range of advisory and brokerage services to the company s clients 
nfp serves corporate and high net worth individual clients throughout the united states and in canada  with a focus on the middle market and entrepreneurs 
as of december   the company operated over businesses 
founded in  the company has grown organically and through acquisitions  operating in the independent distribution channel 
this distribution channel offers independent advisors the flexibility to sell products and services from multiple non affiliated providers to deliver objective  comprehensive solutions 
the number of products and services available to independent advisors is large and can lead to a fragmented marketplace 
nfp facilitates the efficient sale of products and services in this marketplace by using its scale and market position to contract with leading product providers 
these relationships foster access to a broad array of insurance and financial products and services as well as better underwriting support and operational services 
in addition  the company is able to operate effectively in this distribution channel by leveraging financial and intellectual capital  technology solutions  cross selling  and regulatory compliance support across the company 
the company s marketing and wholesale organizations also provide an independent distribution channel for benefits  insurance and investment products and services  serving both third party affiliates as well as member nfp owned businesses 
effective january   nfp organized its businesses into three reportable segments the ccg  the icg and the asg 
periods prior to january  have been restated to reflect this basis of segmentation 
the ccg is one of the leading corporate benefits advisors in the middle market  offering independent solutions for health and welfare  retirement planning  executive benefits  and commercial property and casualty insurance 
the icg is a leader in the delivery of independent life insurance  annuities  long term care and wealth transfer solutions for high net worth individuals and includes wholesale life brokerage  retail life and investment advisory services 
the asg  including nfpsi  a leading independent broker dealer and registered investment advisor  serves independent financial advisors whose clients are high net worth individuals and companies by offering broker dealer and asset management products and services 
the asg attracts financial advisors seeking to provide clients with sophisticated resources and an open choice of products 
nfp promotes collaboration among its business lines to provide its clients the advantages of a single coordinated resource to address their corporate and individual benefits  insurance and wealth management planning needs 
nfp enhances its competitive position by offering its clients a broad array of insurance and financial solutions 
nfp s continued investments in marketing  compliance and product support provide its independent advisors with the resources to deliver strong client service 
nfp believes its operating structure allows its businesses to effectively and objectively serve clients at the local level while having access to the resources of a national company 
nfp s senior management team is composed of experienced insurance and financial services leaders 
the company s principals  who manage the day to day operations of many of nfp s subsidiaries  are professionals who are well positioned to understand client needs 
while the challenging economic environment is showing signs of stabilization  there is uncertainty as to the scope of a full economic recovery 
market volatility and an uncertain economic environment may reduce the demand for the company s services or the products the company distributes and could negatively affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents results of operations the company earns revenue that consists primarily of commissions and fees earned from the sale of financial products and services to their clients 
the company also incurs commissions and fees expense and compensation and non compensation expense in the course of earning revenue 
nfp pays management fees to non employee principals and or certain entities they own based on the financial performance of each respective business 
the company refers to revenue earned by the company s businesses less the operating expenses of its businesses and allocated shared expenses associated with shared corporate resources as income loss from operations 
the company s operating expenses include commissions and fees  compensation and non compensation expense  management fees  amortization  depreciation  impairment of intangible assets and gain loss on sale of businesses 
in addition to its evaluation of its reportable segments performance  the company also evaluates the profit it shares with the principals on a reportable segment basis 
in order to monitor this it uses the following non gaap measures income before management fees  adjusted income before management fees and management fees as a percentage of adjusted income before management fees 
for a reconciliation of these non gaap measures to their gaap counterparts  see operating expenses management fees 
information with respect to all sources of revenue and income loss from operations and income before management fees by reportable segment for the years ended december    and  is presented below in millions 
for the years ended december  revenue commissions and fees corporate client group individual client group advisor services group total income loss from operations corporate client group individual client group advisor services group total income before management fees corporate client group individual client group advisor services group total overview of the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  during the year ended december   revenue increased million  or  to million from million during the year ended december  the revenue increase was driven by revenue increases within the asg and ccg of million and million  respectively  and offset by a revenue decrease of million within the icg 
during the year ended december   icg revenue was negatively impacted by dispositions and changing product offerings at carriers and uncertainty around estate tax exemption levels that were only resolved in december existing firms within all segments contributed to an overall revenue increase of million  offset by a million decline in revenue from disposed firms 

table of contents income loss from operations increased million or to million for the year ended december  from a loss from operations of million for the year ended december  the company s income from operations increased substantially primarily due to the decline in impairments from million in to million in the decline in impairments was driven by the significant impairment taken during the three months ended march  income before management fees increased million or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the company s income before management fees improved primarily due to increases in revenue within the ccg and asg  offset by decreases in revenue at the icg 
commission expense increased slightly in the ccg and icg  with commission expense of million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  this is compared with commission expense of million and million  respectively for the year ended december  the increase in commission payouts at the asg was commensurate with the increase in revenue 
in addition  compensation expense decreased in each of the three segments and non compensation expense decreased within the ccg and icg  primarily due to a million loss and related expenses recognized on the sublet of one of the floors of the company s new york corporate headquarters in the fourth quarter of this expense was allocated among the segments 
as of december  the ratio of base earnings to target earnings by segment was for the ccg and for the icg 
since the asg is primarily comprised of nfpsi  nfp s registered broker dealer and investment advisor  no management fees are paid and no earnings are shared with principals 
management fees increased primarily as a result of the accelerated vesting of certain rsus 
excluding the impact of this one time vesting  management fees increased slightly  due to increases in management fees within the ccg  offset by decreases in management fees within the icg 
the increase in management fees within the ccg is attributable to the year over year increase in stock based compensation  related to the long term equity incentive plan the eip 
the eip was in place in november  and was terminated in september the decrease in management fees within the icg is attributable to increases related to restructuring of certain management agreements and the year over year increase in stock based compensation  offset by decreases in the annual principal incentive plan pip expense 
overview of the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  during the year ended december   revenue decreased million  or  to million from  million during the year ended december  the revenue decrease was driven by revenue decreases within all three business segments 
icg revenue was negatively impacted by the broader economic environment and uncertainty regarding the financial stability of insurance carriers in the first months of the company also experienced declines in the ccg  as some clients reduced benefits offered to employees due to cost cutting measures and rising unemployment 
asg revenue decreased as fees for assets under management declined with declining market values during as compared to acquired firms within the ccg and icg contributed to an overall revenue increase of million  offset by a million decline in revenue from disposed firms 
income loss from operations decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the company s income loss from operations decreased substantially primarily due to an increase in the level of impairments of goodwill and intangible assets from million in to million in income before management fees decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decline in income before management fees was a result of lower revenue across all three segments 
compensation expense declined from million in to million in dispositions accounted for million of this decline 
compensation expense as a percentage of revenue increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  non compensation expense declined from million from the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the decline in non compensation expense during was largely a result of cost reduction initiatives across the businesses  offset by a million loss and related 
table of contents expenses recognized on the sublet of one of the floors of the company s new york corporate headquarters in the fourth quarter of  which was allocated through the segments 
dispositions also accounted for million of this decline 
non compensation expense as a percentage of revenue was for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  the increase in compensation expense and non compensation expense as a percentage of revenue was largely a result of the sharp decline in revenue 
in  the increase in management fees as a percentage of adjusted income before management fees was largely due to the increase in the accrual during the fourth quarter for the pip of million  of which million was allocated to the ccg and the remaining million to the icg 
excluding the effect of this accrual  management fees was lower compared with the prior year period due to a decline in the ongoing incentive plan accrual and lower business earnings 
on a segment level  management fees increased slightly within the ccg  and decreased by million in the icg 
revenue many factors affect the company s revenue and profitability  including economic and market conditions  legislative and regulatory developments and competition 
because many of these factors are unpredictable and generally beyond the company s control  the company s revenue and earnings will fluctuate from year to year and quarter to quarter 
the company generates revenue primarily from the following sources corporate client group 
the ccg earns commissions on the sale of insurance policies and fees for the development  implementation and administration of corporate and executive benefits programs 
in the corporate benefits business line  commissions and fees are generally paid each year as long as the client continues to use the product and maintains its broker of record relationship with the company 
commissions are based on a percentage of insurance premium or are based on a fee per plan participant 
in some cases  such as for the administration of retirement focused products like k plans  fees earned are based on the amount of assets under administration or advisement 
generally  in the executive benefits business line  consulting fees are earned relative to the completion of specific client engagements  administration fees are earned throughout the year on policies  and commissions are earned as a calculated percentage of the premium in the year that the policy is originated and during subsequent renewal years  as applicable 
the ccg also offers property and casualty insurance brokerage and consulting services for which it earns commissions and fees 
nfp believes that these services complement the corporate and executive benefits services provided to the company s clients 
individual client group 
commissions paid by insurance companies are based on a percentage of the premium that the insurance company charges to the policyholder 
in the marketing organization and wholesale life brokerage business line  the icg generally receives commissions paid by the insurance carrier for facilitating the placement of the product 
wholesale life brokerage revenue also includes amounts received by nfp s life brokerage entities  including its life settlements brokerage entities which assist advisors with the placement and sale of life insurance 
in the retail life business line  commissions are generally calculated as a percentage of premiums  generally paid in the first year 
the icg receives renewal commissions for a period following the first year 
the icg s investment advisory business line earns fees for offering financial advisory and related services 
these fees are generally based on a percentage of assets under management and are paid quarterly 
in addition  the icg may earn commissions related to the sale of securities and certain investment related insurance products 
advisor services group 
the asg earns fees for providing the platform for financial advisors to offer financial advice and execute financial planning strategies 
these fees are based on a percentage of assets under management and are generally paid quarterly 
the asg may also earn fees for the development of a financial plan or annual fees for advising clients on asset allocation 
the asg also earns commissions related to the sale of securities and certain investment related insurance products 
such commission income and related expenses are recorded on a trade date basis 
transaction based fees  
table of contents including incentive fees  are recognized when all contractual obligations have been satisfied 
most nfp owned businesses and members of nfp s marketing and wholesale organizations conduct securities or investment advisory business through nfpsi 
some of the company s businesses also earn additional compensation in the form of incentive and marketing support revenue from manufacturers of financial services products  based on the volume  consistency and profitability of business generated by the company from these three sources 
incentive and marketing support revenue is recognized at the earlier of notification of a payment or when payment is received  unless historical data or other information exists which enables management to reasonably estimate the amount earned during the period 
these forms of payments are earned both with respect to sales by the company s businesses and sales by nfp s third party affiliates 
the vast majority of the company s revenue is generated from its united states operations 
although nfp s operating history is limited  until the company earned approximately to of its revenue in the first three quarters of the year and approximately to of its revenue in the fourth quarter 
in and  nfp earned of its revenue in the fourth quarter 
this change resulted primarily from a weaker sales environment for life insurance products in the icg 
historically  life insurance sales had been concentrated in the fourth quarter as clients finalized their estate and tax planning decisions 
continued relative weakness in this market has meant a change in the revenue patterns for the business 
operating expenses in the discussion that follows  nfp provides the following ratios with respect to its operating results i commission expense ratio  ii compensation expense ratio and iii non compensation expense ratio 
the commission expense ratio is derived by dividing commissions and fee expense by total revenue 
the compensation expense ratio is derived by dividing compensation expense by total revenue 
the non compensation expense ratio is derived by dividing non compensation expense by total revenue 
included within the ccg s revenue are amounts required to eliminate intercompany revenue recorded between the company s corporate benefits and executive benefits business lines 
included within the icg revenue are amounts required to be recorded to eliminate intercompany revenue recorded between the company s marketing organization and wholesale life brokerage  retail life and investment advisory business lines 
included within asg revenue are amounts required to be recorded to eliminate intercompany revenue recorded between nfpsi and the icg 
commissions and fees 
commissions and fees are typically paid to third party producers  who are producers that are affiliated with the company s businesses 
commissions and fees are also paid to producers who utilize the services of one or more of the company s life brokerage entities  including the company s life settlements brokerage entities 
additionally  commissions and fees are paid to producers who provide referrals and specific product expertise 
when earnings are generated solely by a principal  no commission expense is incurred because principals are only paid from a share of the cash flow of the business through management fees 
however  when income is generated by a third party producer  the producer is generally paid a portion of the commission income  which is reflected as commission expense 
rather than collecting the full commission and remitting a portion to a third party producer  a business may include the third party producer on the policy application submitted to a carrier 
the carrier will  in these instances  directly pay each named producer their respective share of the commissions and fees earned 
when this occurs the business will record only the commissions and fees it receives directly as revenue and have no commission expense 
as a result  the business will have lower revenue and commission expense and a higher income from operations as a percentage of revenue 
dollars generated from income from operations will be the same 
the transactions in which a business is listed as the sole producer and pays commissions to a third party producer  compared with transactions in which the carrier pays each producer directly  will cause nfp s income from operations as a percentage of revenue to fluctuate without affecting income from operations 
in addition  within the asg  nfpsi pays commissions to the company s affiliated third party distributors who transact business through nfpsi 

table of contents compensation expense 
the company s businesses incur operating expenses related to compensating producing and non producing staff 
in addition  nfp allocates compensation expense associated with corporate shared services to nfp s three reportable segments largely based on performance by the segments and other reasonable assumptions and estimates as it relates to the corporate shared services support of the operating segments 
compensation expense includes both cash and stock based compensation 
nfp records share based payments related to employees and activities as well as allocated amounts from its corporate shared services to compensation expense as a component of compensation expense 
non compensation expense 
the company s businesses incur operating expenses related to occupancy  professional fees  insurance  promotional  travel and entertainment  telecommunication  technology  legal  internal audit  certain compliance costs and other general expenses 
in addition  nfp allocates non compensation expense associated with nfp s corporate shared services to nfp s three reportable segments largely based on performance and other reasonable assumptions and estimates as it relates to the corporate shared services support of the operating segments 
management fees 
nfp pays management fees to the principals and or certain entities they own based on the financial performance of the business they manage 
from a cash perspective nfp may advance monthly management fees that have not yet been earned due to the seasonality of the earnings of certain subsidiaries  particularly in the icg 
nfp typically pays a portion of the management fees monthly in advance 
once nfp receives its cumulative preferred earnings  or base earnings  the principals and or entity the principals own will earn management fees equal to earnings above base earnings up to target earnings 
an additional management fee is paid in respect of earnings in excess of target earnings based on the ratio of base earnings to target earnings 
for example  if base earnings equal of target earnings  nfp receives of earnings in excess of target earnings and the principals and or the entities they own receives 
as of december  the ratio of base earnings to target earnings by segment was for the ccg and for the icg 
since the asg is primarily comprised of nfpsi  nfp s registered broker dealer and investment advisor  no management fees are paid and no earnings are shared with principals 
management fees also include an accrual for certain performance based incentive amounts payable under nfp s ongoing incentive plan  the pip  the business incentive plan the bip and the eip 
for a more detailed discussion of nfp s incentive plans  see incentive plans below 
the company accounts for stock based awards to principals as part of management fee expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
effective june   nfp accounts for stock based awards granted to principals as liability awards 
liability classified stock based compensation is adjusted each reporting period to account for subsequent changes in the fair value of nfp s common stock 
prior to june   nfp incorrectly accounted for stock based awards issued to principals as equity classified awards  and therefore recognized stock based compensation based on nfp s common stock on the date of grant 
the impact of the correction was not material to the prior period financial statements 
on september  nfp accelerated the vesting of approximately million restricted stock units rsus granted to certain principals primarily through the stock incentive plan 
this action resulted in a reduction of nfp s fully diluted shares  eliminated potential earnings volatility associated with the variable accounting treatment of the principals rsus and resulted in a pre tax charge of approximately million in the third quarter of principals likely to receive an incentive payment under the ongoing incentive plan  were given the option to continue to participate in the ongoing incentive plan until the end of their current ongoing incentive plan period 
as of december   two nfp owned businesses elected to continue to participate in the ongoing incentive plan 
for principals that did not so elect and all other principals  the ongoing incentive plan terminated on september  the ongoing incentive plan pays an increasing proportion of incremental earnings based on growth in earnings above an incentive target based on a three year measuring period 
nfp pays an additional cash incentive equal to of the incentive award received 
the ongoing incentive plan rewards growth above the prior period s average earnings or prior incentive target  whichever is higher 
however  once a business reaches earnings in a three year period equal to or in excess of the cumulative amount of its original target 
table of contents compounded at over three years  the new incentive target is fixed 
if the principal does not receive contingent consideration or an incentive payment in a prior period  the incentive target remains unchanged 
the bonus is structured to pay the principal to of nfp s share of incremental earnings from growth 
effective december   nfp has elected to pay all incentive awards under this plan in cash 
executive officers do not participate in the ongoing incentive or pip plan  both of which were funded with the company s cash flow 
management fees may be offset by amounts paid by the principals and or certain entities they own under the terms of the management contract for capital expenditures  including sub acquisitions  in excess of  these amounts may be paid in full or over a mutually agreeable period of time and are recorded as a deferred reduction in management fees 
amounts recorded in deferred reduction in management fees are amortized as a reduction in management fee expense generally over the useful life of the asset 
the ratio of management fees to adjusted income before management fees is dependent on the percentage of total earnings generated by the company  the performance of the company s businesses relative to base earnings and target earnings  the growth of earnings of the company s businesses in the periods after their first three years following acquisition and the asg s impact on income from operations and a small number of businesses without a principal  to which no management fees are paid 
due to nfp s priority earnings position  if earnings are below target earnings in a given year  nfp s share of total earnings would be higher for that year for that business 
if a business produces earnings at or above target earnings  nfp s share of total earnings would be equal to the percentage of the earnings acquired by nfp in the initial transaction  less any percentage due to additional management fees earned under the ongoing incentive plan  pip or bip 
the company records share based payments related to principals as management fees 
the table below summarizes the results of operations of nfp s reportable segments for the periods presented and uses the following non gaap measures i income before management fees  ii adjusted income before management fees iii management fees as a percentage of adjusted income before management fees and iv management fees excluding accelerated vesting of certain rsus 
the company defines income before management fees as income from operations excluding management fees  amortization  depreciation  impairment of intangible assets and the gain or loss on the sale of businesses 
income before management fees is a metric management utilizes in its evaluation of the profitability of an nfp owned business  before principals receive participation in the earnings 
the company defines adjusted income before management fees as income before management fees excluding corporate income  which is the allocation of corporate revenue and expenses to businesses where management fees are earned by principals an entity owned by the principals 
the ccg and icg s corporate income includes revenue and expense allocations from the company s corporate shared services 
as previously discussed  since the asg is primarily comprised of nfpsi  an entity for which no management fees are paid and no earnings are shared with principals  all revenue and expenses from the asg are considered a component of corporate income 
the company does not use these non gaap measures to evaluate entities for which no management fees are paid  such as nfpsi 
whether or not a principal participates in the earnings of a business is dependent on the specific characteristics and performance of that business 
management fees as a percentage of adjusted income before management fees represents the percentage of earnings that is not retained by the company as profit  but is paid out to principals 
management fees as a percentage of adjusted income before management fees may generally be lower for the ccg as compared to the icg since in the last several years of acquisitions through  the company focused on acquiring larger businesses with a higher level of recurring revenue  such as benefits businesses in the ccg  and retaining a larger preferred position in the earnings of these businesses 
the company uses management fees excluding accelerated vesting of certain rsus to show management fees without the one time impact of the accelerated vesting of certain rsus on september  management 
table of contents fees excluding accelerated vesting of certain rsus as a percentage of adjusted income before management fees is a non gaap measure useful to investors because it shows the portion of earnings that would have been paid out to principals but for the disproportionate impact of the one time accelerated vesting of certain rsus

this management fee percentage is a variable  not a fixed  ratio 
management fees as a percentage of adjusted income before management fees will fluctuate based upon the aggregate mix of earnings performance by individual businesses 
it is based on the percentage of the company s earnings that are acquired at the time of acquisition as may be adjusted for restructures  the performance relative to nfp s preferred position in the earnings and the growth of the individual businesses and in the aggregate 
management fees may be higher during periods of strong growth due to the increase in incentive accruals 
higher firm earnings will generally be accompanied by higher incentive accruals 
where business earnings decrease  management fees and management fees as a 
table of contents percentage of adjusted income before management fees may be lower as business s earnings fall below target and incentive accruals are either reduced or eliminated 
in addition  because management fees earned are based on a business s cumulative performance through the year  to the extent that a business s performance improves through the year  whether by revenue growth or expense reductions  the management fee as a percentage of adjusted income before management fees may likewise increase through the year 
for example  if a business has base earnings and target earnings of million and million  respectively  and if the business cumulative earnings are million for the first nine months of the year  no management fee would be earned because the cumulative earnings were below the pro rata base earnings for the three quarters of million and the management fee percentage would be zero 
in the remaining fourth quarter  if the business was able to achieve cumulative earnings of million  the management fee earned would be million and the management fee percentage would be equal to approximately for the quarter 
additionally  management fees for the three months ended september  were disproportionately impacted by the one time accelerated vesting of certain rsus on september  further  since nfp retains a cumulative preferred interest in base earnings  the relative percentage of management fees generally decreases as earnings decline 
for businesses that do not achieve base earnings  principals typically earn no management fee 
thus  a principal generally earns more management fees only when business earnings grow and  conversely  principals earn less when business earnings decline 
this structure provides the company with protection against earnings shortfalls through reduced management fee expense  in this manner the interests of the principals and shareholders remain aligned 
management uses these non gaap measures  in conjunction with gaap measures  to evaluate the performance of the ccg and icg 
this cannot be effectively illustrated using the corresponding gaap measures as management fees  the impact of the accelerated vesting of certain rsus and corporate income would be included in these gaap measures and do not show the standalone profitability of the acquired businesses 
on a reportable segment and individual subsidiary basis  the company uses these measures to help the company determine where to allocate corporate and other resources to assist principals to develop additional sources of revenue and improve their earnings performance 
the company may assist these businesses in expense reductions  cross selling  providing new products or services  technology improvements  providing capital for sub acquisitions or coordinating internal mergers 
on a macro level  the company uses these measurements to help it evaluate broad performance of products and services which  in turn  helps shape the company s acquisition policy 
in the last several years of acquisitions through no material acquisitions were completed in the last years  the company has emphasized acquiring businesses with a higher level of recurring revenue  such as benefits businesses in the ccg  and those which expand the company s platform capabilities 
the company also may use these measures to help it assess the level of economic ownership to retain in new acquisitions or existing businesses 
finally  the company uses these measures to monitor the effectiveness of its incentive plans 
amortization of intangibles 
the company incurs amortization expense related to the amortization of certain identifiable intangible assets 
depreciation 
the company incurs depreciation expense related to capital assets  such as investments in technology  office furniture and equipment  as well as amortization for its leasehold improvements 
depreciation expense related to the company s businesses as well as allocated amounts related to corporate shared services are recorded within this line item 
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 
the company evaluates its amortizing long lived assets and non amortizing intangible assets for impairment in accordance with gaap 
see note summary of significant accounting policies and note goodwill and other intangible assets to the company s consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
gain loss on sale of businesses 
from time to time  nfp has disposed of businesses or certain assets of businesses 
in these dispositions  nfp may realize a gain or loss on such sale 

table of contents incentive plans nfp views incentive plans as an essential component in compensating principals and as a way to activate growth across the company 
nfp historically incentivized its principals through the ongoing incentive plan  effective as of january  and in which two nfp owned businesses participated as of december  in  nfp adopted three new incentive plans that included both a cash and equity component two annual cash based plans and one long term equity based plan for principals and key employees of its businesses 
during the quarter ended september   nfp introduced a revised long term incentive plan 
the annual principal incentive plan the pip is designed to reward the annual performance of a business based on the business s earnings growth 
for the initial month performance period of october  through september   a cash incentive payment was made to the extent a business s earnings exceeded its pip performance target as defined below 
the pip was established such that the greater a business s earnings growth rate exceeded its pip performance target rate for the month performance period  the higher the percentage of the business s earnings growth the company would pay the principal under the pip 
nfp calculates and includes a pip accrual in management fees expense 
the company accrued million within management fees expense relating to the initial month performance period  which was paid in the fourth quarter of for this initial month performance period  the incentive target the pip performance target for each business participating in the pip was generally set at the lower of a such business s earnings for the months ended june  or b such business s incentive target under the ongoing incentive plan as of june  the initial month performance period used performance targets that rewarded principals for advancing certain corporate goals and initiatives related to the company s reorganization and also took the difficult economic environment during the initial month performance period into account 
nfp s executive management committee  in its sole discretion  was able to adjust any pip performance target as necessary to account for extraordinary circumstances  including  without limitation  sub acquisitions 
for the initial month performance period  nfp calculated the amount of a business s pip accrual in management fees expense based on the business s earnings growth rate above its pip performance target rate 
the pip performance target over the course of the initial month performance period was allocated on a straight line basis 
nfp calculated a business s pip accrual amount and earnings growth rate on a cumulative basis 
for example  for the quarter ended march   the business s pip accrual amount and earnings growth rate was calculated for the six months from october  the first day of the initial month performance period for the pip to march   and for the quarter ended september   for the twelve months from october  to september  the amount of management fees expense or benefit the company took in a particular quarter for a business s pip accrual depended on the difference between the business s cumulative performance against the pip performance target and what was accrued on a plan to date basis for the period ended on the last day of that quarter and the business s cumulative performance for the period ended on the last day of the preceding quarter 
the amount of pip accrual taken as management fee expense therefore varied from quarter to quarter 
for example  if a business s earnings growth rate exceeded its pip performance target at the same level each quarter  the amount of management fee expense the company took for the business s pip accrual was the same each quarter during the performance period 
in contrast  if a business had weaker earnings growth for a quarter compared with stronger earnings growth in the previous quarter  the business would have a lower level of projected payout than it had in the previous quarter  based on the business s cumulative performance 
because the pip was accrued on a cumulative basis  for the weaker quarter  the cumulative accrual decreased to account for the lower level of projected payout at the end of the performance period and the company reported a smaller pip accrual management fees expense or in some cases the company reported a pip accrual management fees benefit for the business 
conversely  in a stronger quarter  the cumulative accrual increased sequentially to account for the higher level of projected payout at the end of the performance period and the company reported a larger pip accrual in management fees expense for the business 

table of contents a new pip is in place for the month performance period of october  through december  the second pip 
management migrated to an incentive program that rewards only incremental growth but still maintains potential for material incentive payments 
the second pip will be payable in cash beginning in the first quarter of and  similar to the initial pip  is based on specific performance criteria for each business 
incentive targets second pip performance targets have been set based on the earnings of each business during the last pip incentive period  with the fourth quarter of counted twice 
the calculation of a business s second pip performance target is based on a month period and reflects the fact that the second pip will include fourth quarter periods 
the month performance period was selected in order to align the plan with the calendar year 
it is envisioned that future plans will be months  consistent with the calendar year 
nfp s executive management committee  in its sole discretion  may adjust any second pip performance target as necessary to account for extraordinary circumstances  including  without limitation  sub acquisitions 
the second pip accrual in management fee expense is based on the business s earnings growth rate above its second pip performance target

liquidity and capital resources liquidity refers to the ability of an enterprise to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet its needs for cash 
nfp derives liquidity primarily from cash generated by the company s businesses and from financing activities 
for a detailed discussion of nfp s recapitalization transactions  which took place in  see borrowings below 
the company has historically experienced its highest cash usage during the first quarter of each year as balances due to principals and or certain entities they own for earned management fees above target earnings in the prior year calendar are calculated and paid out  more acquisitions are completed and the company experiences the seasonal revenue and earnings decline at the beginning of the year 
as the year progresses  operating cash flow typically increases as earnings increase 
historically  this cash flow pattern has led to additional borrowings in the first quarter 
however  additional borrowings did not occur for the year ended december  or  because cash flow was sufficient to fund management fees to principals of firms that performed in excess of target earnings and the company did not make any material acquisitions during this period 
this pattern could change to the extent acquisitions or sub acquisitions increase  or as capital is deployed for other uses

in addition  if a fundamental change as defined in the indenture governing the notes occurs prior to the maturity date  nfp will  in some cases and subject to certain limitations  increase the conversion rate for a holder that elects to convert its notes in connection with such fundamental change 
concurrent with the issuance of the notes  nfp entered into convertible note hedge and warrant transactions with affiliates of certain of the initial purchasers the counterparties for the notes 
a default under the credit facility would trigger a default under each of the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions  in which case the counterparty could designate early termination under either  or both  of these instruments 
the transactions are expected to reduce the potential dilution to nfp s common stock upon future conversions of the notes 
under the convertible note hedge  nfp purchased  call options for an aggregate premium of million

table of contents upon conversion of the notes or the counterparties exercise of the warrants  the total number of shares of common stock issuable in each case could result in the issuance of more than of the common stock outstanding as of june   the date of issuance of the notes the closing date 
nfp had  shares of common stock outstanding as of the closing date 
because nyse rules state that  in certain circumstances  issuers are required to seek stockholder approval before the issuance of more than of common stock outstanding  the notes limit the issuance of shares of common stock upon conversion of the notes to of nfp s common stock outstanding as of the closing date the note cap 
additionally  the warrants limit the issuance of shares of common stock to of nfp s common stock outstanding as of the closing date the warrant cap 
nfp is contractually required to seek stockholder approval to eliminate the note cap and warrant cap  which it will do at its annual meeting of stockholders 
approval of this proposal would allow nfp to deliver common stock upon conversion without regard to the note cap  and upon the counterparties exercise of the warrants  without regard to the warrant cap 
at the current conversion rate for the notes  the price of the common stock would have to exceed approximately per share  on average  during the observation period with respect to conversions in order for the note cap to limit the amount of conversion consideration payable to holders of the notes 
based on the current strike price for the warrants  the price of the common stock would have to exceed approximately per share  on average  during the expiration period for the warrants in order for the warrant cap to limit the number of shares deliverable to the counterparties under the warrants

table of contents critical accounting policies business acquisitions  purchase price allocations and intangible assets since the company s formation and through december   it has completed acquisition transactions  including sub acquisitions 
all of these transactions have been accounted for using the purchase method  and their related net assets and results of operations were included in the company s consolidated financial statements commencing on their respective acquisition dates 
certain of the acquisitions have provisions for additional contingent consideration based upon the financial results achieved over a multi year period 
this additional consideration is reflected as an increase in goodwill when results are achieved and the outcome of the contingency is determinable beyond a reasonable doubt 
the company allocates the excess of purchase price over net assets acquired to book of business  management contracts  institutional customer relationships  trade name and goodwill 
the company amortizes intangibles over a year period for book of business  a year period for management contracts and an year period for institutional customer relationships 
intangible assets are presented net of accumulated amortization and consist of the following as of december  book of business management contracts trade name institutional customer relationships goodwill total intangible assets and goodwill amortization expense consisted of the following for the years ended december  book of business management contracts trade name institutional customer relationships goodwill total amortization impairment of goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with gaap  long lived assets  such as purchased intangibles subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the company generally performs its recoverability test for its long lived asset groups whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the company establishes an internal financial plan for its individual business lines and measures the actual performance of its business lines against this financial plan 
these events or changes in circumstances include  but are not limited to  when a business line experiences a significant deterioration in its operating cash flow compared to its financial plan or prior year performance  a change in the extent or manner in which the long lived asset is being used  or a current expectation that  more likely than not  a long lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset and by the eventual disposition of the asset 
if the estimated undiscounted cash flows 
table of contents are less than the carrying amount of the underlying asset  an impairment may exist 
the company measures impairments on identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization by comparing the fair value of the asset to the carrying amount of the asset 
in the event that the discounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount  an impairment charge will be recognized for the difference in the consolidated statements of operations 
for the years ended december    and  the company recorded impairment losses of million  million  and million respectively  related to management contract and book of business  which is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations 
in accordance with gaap  goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested at least annually for impairment  and are tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the intangible asset might be impaired 
indicators at the business line level  which is considered a reporting unit for this analysis  include  but are not limited to  a significant deterioration in its operating cash flow compared to its financial plan or prior year performance  loss of key personnel  a decrease in nfp s market capitalization below its book value  and an expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed of 
if one or more indicators of impairment exist  nfp performs an evaluation to identify potential impairments 
if an impairment is identified  nfp measures and records the amount of impairment loss 
a two step impairment test is performed on goodwill for reporting units that demonstrate indicators of impairment 
in the first step  nfp compares the fair value of each reporting unit to the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit 
nfp determines the fair value of its reporting units by blending two valuation approaches the income approach and a market value approach 
in order to determine the relative fair value of each of the reporting units the income approach is conducted first 
these relative values are then scaled to the estimated market value of nfp 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit  goodwill is not impaired and nfp is not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying value of the goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner that is consistent with the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
that is  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
for the years ended december  and  the company recorded impairment losses of million  and million  respectively  related to goodwill and trade name  which is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations 
for the year ended december   no such impairment was recorded

revenue recognition the company earns commissions on the sale of insurance policies and fees for the development  implementation and administration of benefits programs 
commissions and fees are generally paid each year as long as the client continues to use the product and maintains its broker of record relationship with the company 
in some cases  fees earned are based on the amount of assets under administration or advisement 
commissions paid by insurance companies are based on a percentage of the premium that the insurance company charges to the policyholder 
first year commissions are calculated as a percentage of the first twelve months premium on the policy and earned in the year that the policy is originated 
in many cases  the company receives renewal 
table of contents commissions for a period following the first year  if the policy remains in force 
asset based fees are earned for administrative services or consulting related to certain benefits plans 
insurance commissions are recognized as revenue when the following criteria are met the policy application and other carrier delivery requirements are substantially complete  the premium is paid  and the insured party is contractually committed to the purchase of the insurance policy 
carrier delivery requirements may include additional supporting documentation  signed amendments and premium payments

contingent commissions are recorded as revenue when received which  in many cases  is the company s first notification of amounts earned 
contingent commissions are commissions paid by insurance underwriters and are based on the estimated profit and or overall volume of business placed with the underwriter 
the data necessary for the calculation of contingent commissions cannot be reasonably estimated prior to receipt of the commission 
the company earns commissions related to the sale of securities and certain investment related insurance products 
the company also earns fees for offering financial advice and related services 
these fees are based on a percentage of assets under management and are generally paid quarterly

income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with standards established by gaap  which requires the recognition of tax benefits or expenses on the temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of its assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured utilizing statutory enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
effective january   the company adopted guidance which clarified the accounting for uncertain tax positions by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
the company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense 
the company s liability for unrecognized tax benefits decreased increased by million  million  and million during the years ended december   december   and december   respectively

table of contents as of december   the company is subject to us federal income tax examinations for the tax years through  and to various state and local income tax examinations for the tax years through the company believes that it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits could significantly decrease within the next twelve months due to the settlement of state income tax audits and expiration of statutes of limitations in various state and local jurisdictions in an amount ranging from million to million based on current estimates 
stock based compensation the company accounts for stock based compensation expense in accordance with the applicable fasb authoritative guidance  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense based on estimated fair values for all share based compensation awards made to employees and non employees over the vesting period of the awards 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment to identify the appropriate valuation model and estimate the assumptions  including the expected term of the stock options and expected stock price volatility  to be used in the calculation 
judgment is also required in estimating the percentage of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
the company estimates the fair value of stock options granted using the black scholes option pricing model with assumptions based primarily on historical data 
stock based awards issued to the company s employees are classified as equity awards 
the company accounts for equity classified stock based awards issued to its employees based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant and recorded as an expense as part of compensation expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
the expense is recorded ratably over the service period  which is generally the vesting period 
the offsetting entry is to additional paid in capital in stockholders equity 
stock based awards issued to the company s principals are classified as liability awards  as principals are non employees 
the company measures the fair value of the stock based awards granted to its principals at the earlier of the date at which performance is completed or a performance commitment has been reached 
the company s stock based awards to principals do not have disincentives for non performance other than forfeiture of the award by the principals and therefore the company measures the fair value of the award when the performance is completed by the principal  which is the completion of the vesting period 
the company accounts for liability classified stock based awards issued to its principals as part of management fee expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
liability classified stock based compensation is adjusted each reporting period to account for subsequent changes in the fair value of nfp s common stock
