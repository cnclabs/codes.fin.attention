wireless voice communications services include basic local and long distance wireless voice services  as well as voicemail  call waiting  three way calling  caller identification  directory assistance and call forwarding 
we offer nextel direct connect push to talk services on our iden network 
we also provide voice and data services to areas in numerous countries outside of the united states through roaming arrangements 
we offer customized design  development  implementation and support services for wireless services provided to large companies and government agencies 
products our services are provided using a wide variety of multi functional devices such as smartphones  mobile broadband devices such as aircards and embedded tablets and laptops manufactured by various suppliers for use with our voice and data services 
we generally sell these devices at prices below our cost in response to competition  to attract new subscribers and as retention inducements for existing subscribers 
we sell accessories  such as carrying cases  hands free devices  batteries  battery chargers and other items to subscribers  and we sell devices and accessories to agents and other third party distributors for resale 
wireless network technologies we deliver wireless services to subscribers primarily through the ownership of our cdma and iden networks or as a reseller of g services 
our cdma network  an all digital wireless network with spectrum licenses that allow us to provide service in all states  puerto rico and the us virgin islands  uses a single frequency band and a digital spread spectrum wireless technology that allows a large number of users to access the band by assigning a code to all voice and data bits  sending a scrambled transmission of the encoded bits over the air and reassembling the voice and data into its original format 
we provide nationwide service through a combination of operating our own digital network in both major and smaller us metropolitan areas and rural connecting routes  affiliations under commercial arrangements with third party affiliates affiliates and roaming on other providers networks 
our iden network is an all digital packet data network based on iden wireless technology provided by motorola mobility  inc and motorola solutions  inc collectively  motorola 
we are the only national wireless service provider in the united states that utilizes iden technology and  generally  the iden devices that we currently offer are not enabled to roam on wireless networks that do not utilize iden technology 
iden is a proprietary technology that relies principally on our and motorola efforts for further research  product development and innovation 
for additional information  see item a  risk factors if motorola is unable or unwilling to provide us with equipment and devices in support of our iden based services  as well as improvements  our operations will be adversely affected 
beginning in  our subscribers in certain markets now have access to clearwire g network through an mvno wholesale arrangement that enables us to resell clearwire g wireless services under the sprint brand name 
the services supported by g give subscribers with compatible devices high speed access to the internet 
this relationship with clearwire was developed through a transaction that closed on november   at which time we  third parties and clearwire joined together to combine a next generation wireless broadband business 

table of contents sales  marketing and customer care we focus the marketing and sales of wireless services on targeted groups of retail subscribers individual consumers  businesses and government subscribers 
we use a variety of sales channels to attract new subscribers of wireless services  including direct sales representatives whose efforts are focused on marketing and selling wireless services primarily to mid sized to large businesses and government agencies  retail outlets owned and operated by us  that focus on sales to the consumer market as well as third party retailers  indirect sales agents that primarily consist of local and national non affiliated dealers and independent contractors that market and sell services to businesses and the consumer market  and are generally paid through commissions  and subscriber convenient channels  including web sales and telesales 
we market our postpaid services under the sprint and nextel brands 
we offer these services on a contract basis typically for one or two year periods  with services billed on a monthly basis according to the applicable pricing plan 
we market our prepaid services under the boost mobile  virgin mobile  assurance wireless and common cents sm brands  as a means to provide value driven prepaid service plans to particular markets 
our wholesale customers are resellers of our wireless services rather than end use subscribers and market their products using their brands 
although we market our services using traditional print and television advertising  we also provide exposure to our brand names and wireless services through various sponsorships  including the national association for stock car auto racing nascar 
the goal of these marketing initiatives is to increase brand awareness and sales 
our customer management organization works to improve our customer experience  with the goal of retaining subscribers of our wireless services 
customer service call centers  some of which are operated by us and some of which are operated by unrelated parties subject to sprint standards of operation  receive and resolve inquiries from subscribers and proactively address subscriber needs 
competition we believe that the market for wireless services has been and will continue to be characterized by intense competition on the basis of price  the types of services and devices offered and quality of service 
we compete with a number of wireless carriers  including three other national wireless companies at t  verizon wireless and t mobile 
our primary competitors offer voice  high speed data  entertainment and location based services and push to talk type features that are designed to compete with our products and services 
other competitors offer or have announced plans to introduce similar services 
at t and verizon also offer competitive wireless services packaged with local and long distance voice  high speed internet services and video 
our prepaid services compete with a number of carriers and resellers including metro pcs communications  inc  leap wireless international  inc and tracfone wireless  which offer competitively priced calling plans that include unlimited local calling 
additionally  at t  t mobile and verizon also offer competitive prepaid services and wholesale service to resellers 
competition will increase to the extent that new firms enter the market as a result of the introduction of other technologies such as long term evolution lte  the availability of previously unavailable spectrum bands  such as the megahertz mhz spectrum band and potentially the introduction of new services using unlicensed spectrum 
wholesale services and products also contribute to increased competition 
in some instances  resellers that use our network and offer like services compete against our offerings 
most markets in which we operate have high rates of penetration for wireless services  thereby limiting the growth of subscribers of wireless services 
as the wireless market matures  it is becoming increasingly important to retain existing subscribers in addition to attracting new subscribers 
wireless carriers are beginning to address growing non traditional data needs by working with original equipment manufacturers to develop connected devices such as remote monitoring  in vehicle devices and digital signage  which utilize wireless networks to increase customer and business mobility 
in addition  we and our competitors continue to offer more service plans that combine voice and data offerings  plans that allow users to add additional mobile devices to their plans at attractive rates  plans with a higher number of bundled minutes included in the fixed monthly charge for the plan  plans that offer the ability to share minutes among a group of related subscribers  or combinations of these features 
consumers respond to these plans by migrating to those they deem most attractive 
in addition  wireless carriers also try to appeal to subscribers by offering devices at prices lower than their acquisition cost  and we may offer higher cost devices at greater discounts than our competitors  with the expectation that the loss incurred on the device will be offset by future service revenue 
as a result  we and our competitors recognize immediate losses that will not be recovered until future periods when service is provided 
our ability to effectively compete in the wireless business is dependent upon our ability to retain existing and attract new subscribers in an increasingly competitive marketplace 
see item a  risk factors if we are not able attract and retain wireless subscribers  our financial performance will be impaired 

table of contents wireline we provide a broad suite of wireline voice and data communications services to other communications companies and targeted business and consumer subscribers 
in addition  we provide voice  data and ip communication services to our wireless segment and ip and other services to cable multiple system operators msos that resell our local and long distance services and use our back office systems and network assets in support of their telephone service provided over cable facilities primarily to residential end user subscribers 
we are one of the nation largest providers of long distance services and operate all digital global long distance and tier ip networks 
services and products our services and products include domestic and international data communications using various protocols such as multiprotocol label switching technologies mpls  ip  managed network services  voice over internet protocol voip  session initiated protocol sip and traditional voice services 
our ip services can also be combined with wireless services 
such services include our sprint mobile integration service which enables a wireless handset to operate as part of a subscriber wireline voice network and our datalink sm service  which uses our wireless networks to connect a subscriber location into their primarily wireline wide area ip mpls data network  making it easy for businesses to adapt their network to changing business requirements 
in addition to providing services to our business customers  the wireline network is carrying increasing amounts of voice and data traffic for our wireless segment as a result of growing usage by those wireless customers 
we continue to assess the portfolio of services provided by our wireline business and are focusing our efforts on ip based services and de emphasizing stand alone voice services and non ip based data services 
we also provide wholesale voice local and long distance services to large cable msos  which they offer as part of their bundled service offerings  as well as traditional voice and data services for their enterprise use 
however  the digital voice services we provide to some of our mso have become large enough in scale that they have decided to in source these services 
although we continue to provide voice services to residential consumers  we no longer actively market those services 
our wireline segment markets and sells its services primarily through direct sales representatives 
competition our wireline segment competes with at t  verizon communications  qwest communications  level communications  inc  other major local incumbent operating companies  cable operators and other telecommunications providers in all segments of the long distance communications market 
in recent years  our long distance voice services have experienced an industry wide trend of lower revenue from lower prices and competition from other wireline and wireless communications companies  as well as cable msos and internet service providers 
some competitors are targeting the high end data market and are offering deeply discounted rates in exchange for high volume traffic as they attempt to utilize excess capacity in their networks 
in addition  we face increasing competition from other wireless and ip based service providers 
many carriers are competing in the residential and small business markets by offering bundled packages of both local and long distance services 
competition in long distance is based on price and pricing plans  the types of services offered  customer service  and communications quality  reliability and availability 
our ability to compete successfully will depend on our ability to anticipate and respond to various competitive factors affecting the industry  including new services that may be introduced  changes in consumer preferences  demographic trends  economic conditions and pricing strategies 
see item a  risk factors consolidation and competition in the wholesale market for wireline services  as well as consolidation of our roaming partners and access providers used for wireless services  could adversely affect our revenues and profitability and the blurring of the traditional dividing lines among long distance  local  wireless  video and internet services contribute to increased competition 
legislative and regulatory developments overview communications services are subject to regulation at the federal level by the federal communications commission fcc and in certain states by public utilities commissions pucs 
the communications act of communications act preempts states from regulating the rates or entry of commercial mobile radio service cmrs providers  such as those services provided through our wireless segment  and imposes various licensing and technical requirements implemented by the fcc  including provisions related to the acquisition  assignment or transfer of radio licenses 
cmrs providers are subject to state regulation of other terms and conditions of service 
our wireline segment also is subject to federal and state regulation 
the following is a summary of the regulatory environment in which we operate and does not describe all present and proposed federal  state and local legislation and regulations affecting the communications industry 
some legislation and regulations are the subject of judicial proceedings  legislative hearings and administrative proceedings that could change the manner in which our industry operates 
we cannot predict the outcome of any of these matters or their potential impact on our business 
see item a  risk factors government regulation could adversely affect our prospects and results of operations  the fcc and state regulatory commissions may adopt new regulations or take other actions that could adversely affect our business prospects  future growth or results of operations 
regulation in the communications industry is subject to change  
table of contents which could adversely affect us in the future 
the following discussion describes some of the major communications related regulations that affect us  but numerous other substantive areas of regulation not discussed here may also influence our business 
regulation and wireless operations the fcc regulates the licensing  construction  operation  acquisition and sale of our wireless operations and wireless spectrum holdings 
fcc requirements impose operating and other restrictions on our wireless operations that increase our costs 
the fcc does not currently regulate rates for services offered by cmrs providers  and states are legally preempted from regulating such rates and entry into any market  although states may regulate other terms and conditions 
the communications act and fcc rules also require the fcc prior approval of the assignment or transfer of control of an fcc license  although the fcc rules permit spectrum lease arrangements for a range of wireless radio service licenses  including our licenses  with fcc oversight 
approval from the federal trade commission and the department of justice  as well as state or local regulatory authorities  also may be required if we sell or acquire spectrum interests 
the fcc sets rules  regulations and policies to  among other things grant licenses in the mhz band  mhz band  gigahertz ghz personal communications services pcs band  and license renewals  rule on assignments and transfers of control of fcc licenses  and leases covering our use of fcc licenses held by other persons and organizations  govern the interconnection of our cdma and iden networks with other wireless and wireline carriers  establish access and universal service funding provisions  impose rules related to unauthorized use of and access to customer information  impose fines and forfeitures for violations of fcc rules  regulate the technical standards governing wireless services  and impose other obligations that it determines to be in the public interest we hold several kinds of licenses to deploy our services ghz pcs licenses utilized in the cdma network  and mhz and mhz licenses utilized in the iden network 
we also hold ghz and other fcc licenses that are not yet placed into service but that we intend to use in accordance with fcc requirements 
ghz pcs license conditions all pcs licenses are granted for ten year terms 
for purposes of issuing pcs licenses  the fcc utilizes major trading areas mtas and basic trading areas btas with several btas making up each mta 
each license is subject to build out requirements which we have met in all of our mta and bta markets 
if applicable build out conditions are met  these licenses may be renewed for additional ten year terms 
renewal applications are not subject to auctions 
if a renewal application is challenged  the fcc grants a preference commonly referred to as a license renewal expectancy to the applicant if the applicant can demonstrate that it has provided substantial service during the past license term and has substantially complied with applicable fcc rules and policies and the communications act 
the licenses for the mhz of spectrum in the ghz band that we received as part of the fcc report and order  described below  have ten year terms and are not subject to specific build out conditions  but are subject to renewal requirements that are similar to those for our pcs licenses 
mhz and mhz license conditions we hold licenses for channels in the mhz and mhz bands that are currently used to deploy our iden services 
because spectrum in these bands originally was licensed in small groups of channels  we hold thousands of these licenses  which together allow us to provide coverage across much of the continental united states 
our mhz and mhz licenses are subject to requirements that we meet population coverage benchmarks tied to the initial license grant dates 
to date  we have met all of the construction requirements applicable to these licenses  except in the case of licenses that are not material to our business 
our mhz and mhz licenses have ten year terms  at the end of which each license is subject to renewal requirements that are similar to those for our ghz licenses 
spectrum reconfiguration obligations in  the fcc adopted a report and order that included new rules regarding interference in the mhz band and a comprehensive plan to reconfigure the mhz band the report and order 
the report and order provides for the exchange of a portion of our mhz fcc spectrum licenses  and requires us to fund the cost incurred by public safety systems and other incumbent licensees to reconfigure the mhz spectrum band 
in addition  we received licenses for mhz of nationwide spectrum in the ghz band  however  we were required to relocate and reimburse the incumbent licensees in this band for their costs of relocation to another band designated by the fcc 
the minimum cash obligation under the report and order is approximately billion 
we are  however  obligated to pay the full amount of the costs relating to 
table of contents the reconfiguration plan  even if those costs exceed billion 
as required under the terms of the report and order  a letter of credit has been secured to provide assurance that funds will be available to pay the relocation costs of the incumbent users of the mhz spectrum 
we submit the qualified mhz relocation costs to the fcc for review for potential letter of credit reductions on a periodic basis 
as a result of these reviews  our letter of credit was reduced from billion at the start of the project to billion in as approved by the fcc 
completion of the mhz band reconfiguration was initially required by june  the fcc continues to grant mhz public safety licensees additional time to complete their band reconfigurations which  in turn  delays sprint access to some of our mhz replacement channels 
under an october fcc order  march  was the target date for us to begin to relinquish some of our mhz channels on a region by region basis prior to receiving all of our fcc designated mhz replacement channels 
on march   however  the fcc granted sprint request that it delay the march  deadline for one year until march  in markets where public safety licensees have not yet moved off most of sprint replacement channels 
we have requested an additional extension of the deadline in a small subset of the markets where public safety licensees have not yet moved off of sprint replacement channels 
accordingly  we will continue to transition to our mhz replacement channels consistent with public safety licensees reconfiguration progress 
we completed all our of ghz incumbent relocation and reimbursement obligations in the second half of new spectrum opportunities and spectrum auctions several fcc proceedings and initiatives are underway that may affect the availability of spectrum used or useful in the provision of commercial wireless services  which may allow new competitors to enter the wireless market 
we cannot predict when or whether the fcc will conduct any spectrum auctions or if it will release additional spectrum that might be useful to wireless carriers  including us  in the future 
services pursuant to fcc rules  cmrs providers  including us  are required to provide enhanced e services in a two tiered manner 
specifically  wireless carriers are required to transmit to a requesting public safety answering point psap both the caller telephone number and a the location of the cell site from which the call is being made  or b the location of the customer handset using latitude and longitude  depending upon the capability of the psap 
implementation of e service must be completed within six months of a psap request for service in its area  or longer  based on the agreement between the individual psap and carrier 
as a part of the fcc approval of the clearwire transaction  we committed to measure the accuracy of our systems at the county level with certain exceptions 
on november   we notified the fcc that we had met the first of our e location accuracy commitments 
we believe we will be able to comply with the final benchmark by the deadline 
national security issues involving national security and disaster recovery are likely to continue to receive attention at the fcc  state and local levels  and congress 
a major focus of the federal government is cyber security 
congress is expected to take up legislation implementing measures to increase the security and resiliency of the nation digital infrastructure 
we cannot predict the cost impact of such legislation 
the fcc has chartered the communications security  reliability and interoperability council consisting of communications companies  public safety agencies and non profit consumer and community organizations to make recommendations to the fcc to ensure optimal security  reliability  and interoperability of communications systems 
we are a member of the council 
in addition  the fcc and the federal emergency management agency department of homeland security are likely to continue to focus on disaster preparedness and communications among first responders 
we have voluntarily agreed to provide wireless emergency alerts over our cdma network 
under the time line developed by the fcc  the provision of such alerts is to begin no later than april tower siting wireless systems must comply with various federal  state and local regulations that govern the siting  lighting and construction of transmitter towers and antennas  including requirements imposed by the fcc and the federal aviation administration 
fcc rules subject certain cell site locations to extensive zoning  environmental and historic preservation requirements and mandate consultation with various parties  including native americans 
the fcc adopted significant changes to its rules governing historic preservation review of projects  which makes it more difficult and expensive to deploy antenna facilities 
the fcc recently has imposed a tower siting shot clock that would require local authorities to address tower applications within a specific timeframe 
this may assist carriers in more rapid deployment of towers 
other changes to environmental protection and tower construction rules  however  are still possible 
to the extent governmental agencies impose additional requirements on the tower siting process  the time and cost to construct cell towers could be negatively impacted 

table of contents state and local regulation while the communications act generally preempts state and local governments from regulating entry of  or the rates charged by  wireless carriers  certain state pucs and local governments regulate customer billing  termination of service arrangements  advertising  certification of operation  use of handsets when driving  service quality  sales practices  management of customer call records and protected information and many other areas 
also  some state attorneys general have become more active in bringing lawsuits related to the sales practices and services of wireless carriers 
varying practices among the states may make it more difficult for us to implement national sales and marketing programs 
states also may impose their own universal service support requirements on wireless and other communications carriers  similar to the contribution requirements that have been established by the fcc  and some states are requiring wireless carriers to help fund the provision of intrastate relay services for consumers who are hearing impaired 
we anticipate that these trends will continue to require us to devote legal and other resources to work with the states to respond to their concerns while attempting to minimize any new regulation and enforcement actions that could increase our costs of doing business 
regulation and wireline operations competitive local service the telecommunications act of telecom act the first comprehensive update of the communications act  was designed to promote competition  and it eliminated legal and regulatory barriers for entry into local and long distance communications markets 
it also required incumbent local exchange carriers ilecs to allow resale of specified local services at wholesale rates  negotiate interconnection agreements  provide nondiscriminatory access to certain unbundled network elements and allow co location of interconnection equipment by competitors 
the rules implementing the telecom act remain subject to legal challenges 
thus  the scope of future local competition remains uncertain 
these local competition rules impact us because we provide wholesale services to cable television companies that wish to compete in the local voice telephony market 
our communications and back office services enable the cable companies to provide competitive local and long distance telephone services primarily in a voip format to their end user customers 
voice over internet protocol we offer a growing number of voip based services to business subscribers and transport voip originated traffic for various cable companies 
the fcc has not yet resolved the regulatory classification of voip services  but continues to consider the regulatory status of various forms of voip 
in  the fcc issued an order finding that one form of voip  involving a specific form of computer to computer services for which no charge is assessed and conventional telephone numbers are not used  is an unregulated information service  rather than a telecommunications service  and preempted state regulation of this service 
the fcc also ruled that long distance offerings in which calls begin and end on the ordinary public switched telephone network  but are transmitted in part through the use of ip  are telecommunications services  thereby rendering the services subject to all the regulatory obligations imposed on ordinary long distance services  including payment of access charges and contributions to the universal service fund usf 
in addition  the fcc preempted states from exercising entry and related economic regulation of interconnected voip services that require the use of broadband connections and specialized customer premises equipment and permit users to terminate calls to and receive calls from the public switched telephone network 
however  the fcc ruling did not address specifically whether this form of voip is an information service or a telecommunications service  or what regulatory obligations  such as intercarrier compensation  should apply 
nevertheless  the fcc requires interconnected voip providers to contribute to the federal usf  offer e emergency calling capabilities to their subscribers  and comply with the electronic surveillance obligations set forth in the communications assistance for law enforcement act calea 
because we provide voip services and transport voip originated traffic  an fcc ruling on the regulatory classification of voip services and the applicability of specific intercarrier compensation rates is likely to affect the cost to provide these services  our pricing of these services  access to numbering resources needed to provide these services  and long term e  calea and usf obligations 
continued regulatory uncertainty over the appropriate intercarrier compensation for interconnected voip services has led to many disputes between carriers 
international regulation the wireline services we provide outside the united states are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of foreign governments and international bodies 
in general  this regulation requires that we obtain licenses for the provision of wireline services and comply with certain government requirements 
other regulations network neutrality the regulatory status of broadband services has sparked a debate over net neutrality and open access 
on december   the fcc adopted so called net neutrality rules 
the order adopts three basic rules for fixed broadband internet access services a an obligation to provide transparency to consumers regarding network management practices  performance characteristics  and commercial terms of service  b a prohibition on blocking access to lawful content  applications  services and devices  and c no unreasonable discrimination 
the fcc acknowledged  however  that mobile 
table of contents broadband is in its early stages of development and is rapidly changing 
in this environment  the fcc stated that lesser obligations are warranted on mobile providers 
mobile providers must provide transparency to consumers in the same manner as fixed providers  and not block access to lawful websites and applications that compete with the provider own voice or video telephony services 
the other rules applicable to fixed broadband  including no blocking of other applications  services or devices  will not apply to mobile 
similarly  mobile providers will not be subject to an unreasonable discrimination obligation 
since the net neutrality rules applicable to mobile are relatively narrow and because we have deployed open mobile operating platforms on our devices  such as the android platform created in conjunction with google and the open handset alliance  the rules should not adversely affect the operation of our broadband networks or significantly constrain our ability to manage the networks and protect our users from harm caused by other users and devices 
truth in billing and consumer protection the fcc truth in billing rules generally require both wireline and wireless telecommunications carriers  such as us  to provide full and fair disclosure of all charges on their bills  including brief  clear  and non misleading plain language descriptions of the services provided 
in response to a petition from the national association of state utility consumer advocates  the fcc found that state regulation of cmrs rates  including line items on consumer bills  is preempted by federal statute 
this decision was overturned by the th circuit court of appeals and the supreme court denied further appeal 
as a consequence  states may attempt to impose various regulations on the billing practices of wireless carriers 
in addition  the fcc has opened a new proceeding to address issues of consumer protection  including the use of early termination fees  and appropriate state and federal roles 
if this proceeding or individual state proceedings create changes in the truth in billing rules  our billing and customer service costs could increase 
access charge reform ilecs and competitive local exchange carriers clecs impose access charges for the origination and termination of long distance calls upon wireless and long distance carriers  including our wireless and wireline segments 
also  interconnected local carriers  including our wireless segment  pay to each other reciprocal compensation fees for terminating interconnected local calls 
in addition  ilecs and clecs impose special access charges for their provision of dedicated facilities to other carriers  including both our wireless and wireline segments 
these fees and charges are a significant cost for our wireless and wireline segments 
there are ongoing proceedings at the fcc related to access charges and special access rates  which could impact our costs for these services and the fcc has released recently a further public notice addressing special access charges 
we cannot predict when these proceedings will be completed 
several ilecs have sought and received forbearance from fcc regulation of certain enterprise broadband services 
specifically  the fcc granted forbearance to at t  acs anchorage  centurylink formerly embarq  frontier and citizens from price regulation of their non time division multiplexing tdm based high capacity special access services 
furthermore  in  the us court of appeals for the district of columbia found that verizon was deemed granted forbearance from the same rules when the fcc deadlocked on its similar forbearance petition  and that the deemed grant was unreviewable by the court 
our request for en banc review was denied 
the appeal of the fcc rulings with respect to at t  citizens  frontier and centurylink was denied 
these deregulatory actions by the fcc could enable the ilecs to raise their special access prices 
the fcc currently is considering measures to address traffic pumping by local exchange carriers lecs predominantly in rural exchanges  that have very high access charges 
under traffic pumping arrangements  the lecs partner with other entities to offer free or almost free services such as conference calling and chat lines to end users  these services and payments to the lecs partners are financed through the assessment of high access charges on the end user long distance or wireless carrier 
because of the peculiarities of the fcc access rate rules for small rural carriers  these lecs are allowed to base their rates on low historic demand levels rather than the vastly higher pumped demand levels  which enables the lec to earn windfall profits 
the fcc is considering the legality of traffic pumping arrangements as well as rule changes to ensure that rates charged by lecs experiencing substantial increases in demand volumes are just and reasonable 
as a major wireless and wireline carrier  we have been assessed millions of dollars in access charges for pumped traffic 
adoption by the fcc of measures to limit the windfall profits associated with traffic pumping would have a direct beneficial impact on us resolving outstanding disputes associated with such matters 
positive decisions against several lecs and their traffic pumping partners in us district courts and before the iowa utilities board and the fcc have not resulted in a significant decrease in this activity 

table of contents universal service reform communications carriers contribute to and receive support from various universal service funds established by the fcc and many states 
the federal usf program funds services provided in high cost areas  reduced rate services to low income consumers  and discounted communications and internet services for schools  libraries and rural health care facilities 
the usf is funded from assessments on communications providers  including our wireless and wireline segments  based on fcc prescribed contribution factors applicable to our interstate and international end user revenues from telecommunications services and interconnected voip services 
similarly  many states have established their own universal service funds to which we contribute 
the fcc is considering changing its usf contribution methodology  and may replace the interstate telecommunications revenue based assessment with one based on either connections telephone numbers or connections to the public network or by expanding the revenue base to include data revenues 
the latter approach in particular could impact the amount of our assessments 
the fcc is expected to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking on usf reform in the near future  but final action on the contribution methodology does not seem imminent within next months 
as permitted  we assess subscribers a fee to recover our usf contributions 
in  sprint received approximately million in high cost usf support in jurisdictions as an eligible telecommunications carrier etc 
pursuant to the fcc order authorizing the clearwire transaction  sprint is required to phase out its high cost usf support to zero by  and that process is currently being implemented on a state by state basis 
virgin mobile is now designated as a lifeline only etc in jurisdictions  providing service under our assurance wireless brand  and has etc applications pending or planned in other jurisdictions as well 
virgin mobile federal lifeline usf receipts are anticipated to increase substantially in the fcc also is considering implementation of new broadband universal service funds which may eventually replace the existing high cost voice centric usf 
although timing on the new broadband fund is unclear  sprint will evaluate the relative costs and benefits of requesting support from these new funds when they become available 
electronic surveillance obligations the calea requires telecommunications carriers  including us  to modify equipment  facilities and services to allow for authorized electronic surveillance based on either industry or fcc standards 
our calea obligations have been extended to data and voip networks  and we are in compliance with these requirements 
certain laws and regulations require that we assist various government agencies with electronic surveillance of communications and records concerning those communications 
we are a defendant in four purported class action lawsuits that allege that we participated in a program of intelligence gathering activities for the federal government following the terrorist attacks of september  that violated federal and state law 
relief sought in these cases includes injunctive relief  statutory and punitive damages  and attorneys fees 
we believe these suits have no merit  and they were dismissed by the district court 
the plaintiffs appeal to the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit is pending 
we do not disclose customer information to the government or assist government agencies in electronic surveillance unless we have been provided a lawful request for such information 
environmental compliance our environmental compliance and remediation obligations relate primarily to the operation of standby power generators  batteries and fuel storage for our telecommunications equipment 
these obligations require compliance with storage and related standards  obtaining of permits and occasional remediation 
although we cannot assess with certainty the impact of any future compliance and remediation obligations  we do not believe that any such expenditures will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
we have identified seven former manufactured gas plant sites in nebraska  not currently owned or operated by us  that may have been owned or operated by entities acquired by centel corporation  formerly a subsidiary of ours and now a subsidiary of centurylink 
we and centurylink have agreed to share the environmental liabilities arising from these former manufactured gas plant sites

item a 
risk factors in addition to the other information contained in this form k  the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating us 
our business  financial condition  liquidity or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks 
if we are not able to attract and retain wireless subscribers  our financial performance will be impaired 
we are in the business of selling communications services to subscribers  and our economic success is based on our ability to attract new subscribers and retain current subscribers 
if we are unable to attract and retain wireless subscribers  our financial performance will be impaired  and we could fail to meet our financial obligations  which could result in several outcomes  including controlling investments by third parties  takeover bids  liquidation of assets or insolvency 
beginning in through  we experienced decreases in our total retail postpaid subscriber base of approximately million subscribers excluding the impact of our acquisitions  while our two largest competitors increased their subscribers 
in addition  our average postpaid churn rate was and for the years ended december  and  respectively  while our two largest competitors had churn rates that were substantially lower 
although we have begun to see a reduction in our net loss of postpaid subscribers  if this trend does not continue our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity could be materially adversely affected 

table of contents our ability to compete successfully for new subscribers and to retain our existing subscribers and reduce our rate of churn depends on our successful execution of marketing and sales strategies  including the acceptance of our value proposition  service delivery and customer care activities  including new account set up and billing  and our credit and collection policies  clearwire ability to successfully obtain additional financing for the continued build out of its g network  the successful deployment and completion of our network modernization plan  network vision  including a multi mode network infrastructure and cdma push to talk capabilities of comparable quality to our existing iden push to talk capabilities  actual or perceived quality and coverage of our networks  including clearwire g network  public perception about our brands  our ability to anticipate and develop new or enhanced technologies  products and services that are attractive to existing or potential subscribers  our ability to anticipate and respond to various competitive factors affecting the industry  including new technologies  products and services that may be introduced by our competitors  changes in consumer preferences  demographic trends  economic conditions  and discount pricing and other strategies that may be implemented by our competitors  and our ability to enter into arrangements with mvnos 
until recently  our efforts to attract new postpaid subscribers and reduce churn had not been successful 
the net loss of postpaid subscribers in and can be expected to cause wireless service revenue in to be approximately billion lower than it would have been had those subscribers not been lost 
our ability to retain subscribers may also be negatively affected by industry trends related to subscriber contracts 
for example  we and our competitors no longer require subscribers to renew their contracts when making changes to their pricing plans 
these types of changes could negatively affect our ability to retain subscribers and could lead to an increase in our churn rates if we are not successful in providing an attractive product and service mix 
we expect to incur expenses to attract new subscribers  improve subscriber retention and reduce churn  but there can be no assurance that our efforts will result in new subscribers or a lower rate of subscriber churn 
subscriber losses and a high rate of churn adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations because they result in lost revenues and cash flow 
although attracting new subscribers and retention of existing subscribers are important to the financial viability of our business  there is an added focus on retention because the cost of adding a new subscriber is higher than the cost associated with retention of an existing subscriber 
as the wireless market matures  we must increasingly seek to attract subscribers from competitors and face increased credit risk from new postpaid wireless subscribers 
we and our competitors increasingly must seek to attract a greater proportion of new subscribers from each other existing subscriber bases rather than from first time purchasers of wireless services 
beginning in through  we experienced decreases in our total retail subscriber base of approximately million postpaid subscribers excluding the impact of our acquisitions  while our two largest competitors increased their subscribers 
in addition  the higher market penetration also means that subscribers purchasing postpaid wireless services for the first time  on average  have a lower credit score than existing wireless users  and the number of these subscribers we are willing to accept is dependent on our credit policies 
to the extent we cannot compete effectively for new subscribers  our revenues and results of operations will be adversely affected 
competition and technological changes in the market for wireless services could negatively affect our average revenue per subscriber  subscriber churn  operating costs and our ability to attract new subscribers  resulting in adverse effects on our revenues  future cash flows  growth and profitability 
we compete with a number of other wireless service providers in each of the markets in which we provide wireless services  and we expect competition to increase as additional spectrum is made available for commercial wireless services and as new technologies are developed and launched 
as competition among wireless communications providers has increased  we have created pricing plans that have resulted in declining average revenue per subscriber for voice and data services 
competition in pricing and service and product offerings may also adversely impact subscriber retention and our ability to attract new subscribers  with adverse effects on our results of operations 
a decline in the average revenue per subscriber coupled with a decline in the number of subscribers would negatively impact our revenues  future cash flows  growth and overall profitability  which  in turn  could impact our ability to meet our financial obligations 

table of contents the wireless communications industry is experiencing significant technological change  including improvements in the capacity and quality of digital technology and the deployment of unlicensed spectrum devices 
this change causes uncertainty about future subscriber demand for our wireless services and the prices that we will be able to charge for these services 
spending by our competitors on new wireless services and network improvements could enable our competitors to obtain a competitive advantage with new technologies or enhancements that we do not offer 
rapid change in technology may lead to the development of wireless communications technologies  products or alternative services that are superior to our technologies  products  or services or that consumers prefer over ours 
if we are unable to meet future advances in competing technologies on a timely basis  or at an acceptable cost  we may not be able to compete effectively and could lose subscribers to our competitors 
mergers or other business combinations involving our competitors and new entrants  including new wholesale relationships  beginning to offer wireless services may also continue to increase competition 
these wireless operators may be able to offer subscribers network features or products and services not offered by us  coverage in areas not served by either of our wireless networks or pricing plans that are lower than those offered by us  all of which would negatively affect our average revenue per subscriber  subscriber churn  ability to attract new subscribers  and operating costs 
for example  at t  verizon and t mobile now offer competitive wireless services packaged with local and long distance voice and high speed internet services  and flat rate voice and data plans 
our prepaid services compete with several regional carriers  including metro pcs and leap wireless  which offer competitively priced prepaid calling plans that include unlimited local calling 
in addition  we may lose subscribers of our higher priced plans to our prepaid offerings 
several wireless equipment vendors  including motorola  which supplies equipment for our push to talk services  have begun to offer wireless equipment that is capable of providing push to talk services that are designed to compete with our current push to talk services 
several of our competitors have introduced devices that are capable of providing push to talk services 
we announced a major network modernization plan in december  network vision  one component of network vision is the deployment of push to talk technology through the use of multi modal technology on a single integrated network 
if our efforts to deploy such technology are not achieved  we may not be able to successfully compete for such services 
see the success of our network modernization plan  network vision  will depend on the timing  extent and cost of implementation  the performance of third parties  upgrade requirements  and the availability and reliability of the various technologies required to provide such modernization 
the success of our network modernization plan  network vision  will depend on the timing  extent and cost of implementation  the performance of third parties  upgrade requirements  and the availability and reliability of the various technologies required to provide such modernization 
we are implementing network vision  which is a multi year initiative intended to reduce operating costs and provide customers with an enhanced network experience by improving voice quality and faster data speeds  while creating network flexibility and improving environmental sustainability 
the focus of the plan is on upgrading the existing sprint networks and providing flexibility for new g technologies 
if network vision does not provide an enhanced network experience or is unable to provide cdma push to talk capabilities of comparable quality to our existing iden push to talk capabilities  our ability to provide enhanced wireless services to our customers  to retain and attract customers  and to maintain and grow our customer revenues could be adversely affected 
using a new and sophisticated technology on a very large scale entails risks 
should implementation of our upgraded network be delayed or costs exceed expected amounts  our margins would be adversely affected and such effects could be material 
should the delivery of services expected to be deployed on our upgraded network be delayed due to technological constraints  performance of third party suppliers  or other reasons  the cost of providing such services could become higher than expected  which could result in higher costs to customers  potentially resulting in decisions to purchase services from our competitors adversely affecting our revenues  profitability and cash flow from operations 
failure to complete development  testing and deployment of new technology that supports new services could affect our ability to compete in the industry 
the deployment of new technology and new service offerings could result in network degradation or the loss of subscribers 
in addition  the technology we use  including wimax  may place us at a competitive disadvantage 
we develop  test and deploy various new technologies and support systems intended to enhance our competitiveness by both supporting new services and features and reducing the costs associated with providing those services 
successful development and implementation of technology upgrades depend  in part  on the willingness of third parties to develop new applications or devices in a timely manner 
we may not successfully complete the development and rollout of new technology and related features or services in a timely manner  and they may not be widely accepted by our subscribers or may not be profitable  in which case we could not recover our investment in the technology 
deployment of technology supporting new service offerings may also adversely affect the performance or reliability of our networks with respect to both the new and existing services and may require us to take action like curtailing new subscribers in certain markets 
any resulting subscriber dissatisfaction could affect our ability to retain subscribers and have an adverse effect on our results of operations and growth 
table of contents prospects 
our wireless networks provide services utilizing cdma and iden technologies 
wireless subscribers served by these two technologies represent a smaller portion of global wireless subscribers than the subscribers served by wireless networks that utilize global system for mobile communications gsm technology 
as a result  our costs with respect to both cdma and iden network equipment and devices may continue to be higher than the comparable costs incurred by our competitors who use gsm technology  which places us at a competitive disadvantage 
we have expended significant resources and made substantial investments to deploy a g mobile broadband network through clearwire using wimax technology 
wimax may not perform as we expect  and  therefore  we may not be able to deliver the quality or types of services we expect 
other competing technologies  including other g or subsequent technologies such as lte  that may have advantages over wimax are being developed  and operators of other networks based on those competing technologies may be able to deploy these alternative technologies at a lower cost and more quickly than the cost and speed with which clearwire deploys its g network providing g mvno services to sprint  which may allow those operators to compete more effectively or may require us and clearwire to deploy such technologies 
these risks could reduce our subscriber growth  increase our costs of providing services or increase our churn 
we entered into agreements in with clearwire to integrate our former g wireless broadband business with theirs 
see risks related to our investment in clearwire below for additional risks related to our investment in clearwire and the deployment of g 
current economic conditions  our recent financial performance and our debt ratings could negatively impact our access to the capital markets resulting in less growth than planned or failure to satisfy financial covenants under our existing debt agreements 
moreover  clearwire may be considered a subsidiary under certain agreements relating to our indebtedness 
although we do not believe we will require additional capital to make the capital and operating expenditures necessary to implement our business plans or to satisfy our debt service requirements for the next few years  we may need to incur additional debt in the future for a variety of reasons  including future investments or acquisitions 
our ability to arrange additional financing will depend on  among other factors  our financial performance  debt ratings  general economic conditions and prevailing market conditions 
some of these factors are beyond our control  and we may not be able to arrange additional financing on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
failure to obtain suitable financing when needed could  among other things  result in our inability to continue to expand our businesses and meet competitive challenges 
our debt ratings could be downgraded if we incur significant additional indebtedness  or if we do not generate sufficient cash from our operations  which would likely increase our future borrowing costs and could affect our ability to access capital 
our credit facility  which expires in october  requires that we maintain a ratio of total indebtedness to trailing four quarters earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and other non cash gains or losses  such as goodwill impairment charges  of no more than to the ratio will be reduced to to beginning in april  and further reduced to to in january as of december   the ratio was to if we do not continue to satisfy this ratio  we will be in default under our credit facility  which could trigger defaults under our other debt obligations  which in turn could result in the maturities of certain debt obligations being accelerated 
certain indentures governing our notes limit  among other things  our ability to incur additional debt  pay dividends  create liens and sell  transfer  lease or dispose of assets 
as of december   we own a economic interest in clearwire 
as a result  clearwire could be considered a subsidiary under certain agreements relating to our indebtedness 
whether clearwire could be considered a subsidiary under our debt agreements is subject to interpretation 
in december  as a result of an amendment to the clearwire equityholders agreement  sprint obtained the right to unilaterally surrender voting securities to reduce its voting security percentage below  which could eliminate the potential for clearwire to be considered a subsidiary of sprint 
until sprint exercises this right  certain actions or defaults by clearwire would  if viewed as a subsidiary  result in a breach of covenants  including potential cross default provisions  under certain agreements relating to our indebtedness 
the trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile and may not reflect our actual operations and performance 
market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operations and performance 
stock price volatility and sustained decreases in our share price could subject our shareholders to losses and us to takeover bids or lead to action by the nyse 
the trading price of our common stock has been  and may continue to be  subject to fluctuations in price in response to various factors  some of which are beyond our control  including  but not limited to quarterly announcements and variations in our results of operations or those of our competitors  either alone or in comparison to analysts expectations  including announcements of subscriber counts and rates of churn that would result in downward pressure on our stock price  the availability or perceived availability of additional capital and market perceptions relating to our access to this capital  
table of contents seasonality or other variations in our subscriber base  including our rate of churn  announcements by us or our competitors of acquisitions  new products  technologies  significant contracts  commercial relationships or capital commitments  the performance of clearwire and clearwire class a common stock or speculation about the possibility of future actions we or other significant shareholders may take in connection with clearwire  disruption to our operations or those of other companies critical to our network operations  announcements by us regarding the entering into  or termination of  material transactions  our ability to develop and market new and enhanced technologies  products and services on a timely basis  including our g network  recommendations by securities analysts or changes in estimates concerning us  the incurrence of additional debt  dilutive issuances of our stock  short sales or hedging of  and other derivative transactions in our common stock  any major change in our board of directors or management  litigation  changes in governmental regulations or approvals  and perceptions of general market conditions in the technology and communications industries  the us economy and global market conditions 
consolidation and competition in the wholesale market for wireline services  as well as consolidation of our roaming partners and access providers used for wireless services  could adversely affect our revenues and profitability 
our wireline segment competes with at t  verizon  qwest communications  level communications inc  other major local incumbent operating companies  and cable operators  as well as a host of smaller competitors  in the provision of wireline services 
some of these companies have high capacity  ip based fiber optic networks capable of supporting large amounts of voice and data traffic 
some of these companies claim certain cost structure advantages that  among other factors  may allow them to offer services at a price below that which we can offer profitably 
in addition  consolidation by these companies could lead to fewer companies controlling access to more cell sites  enabling them to control usage and rates  which could negatively affect our revenues and profitability 
we provide wholesale services under long term contracts to cable television operators which enable these operators to provide consumer and business digital telephone services 
these contracts may not be renewed as they expire  generally in the time period between and increased competition and the significant increase in capacity resulting from new technologies and networks may drive already low prices down further 
at t and verizon continue to be our two largest competitors in the domestic long distance communications market 
we and other long distance carriers depend heavily on local access facilities obtained from ilecs to serve our long distance subscribers  and payments to ilecs for these facilities are a significant cost of service for our wireline segment 
the long distance operations of at t and verizon have cost and operational advantages with respect to these access facilities because those carriers serve significant geographic areas  including many large urban areas  as the incumbent local carrier 
in addition  our wireless segment could be adversely affected by changes in rates and access fees that result from consolidation of our roaming partners and access providers  which could negatively affect our revenues and profitability 
the blurring of the traditional dividing lines among long distance  local  wireless  video and internet services contribute to increased competition 
the traditional dividing lines among long distance  local  wireless  video and internet services are increasingly becoming blurred 
through mergers  joint ventures and various service expansion strategies  major providers are striving to provide integrated services in many of the markets we serve 
this trend is also reflected in changes in the regulatory environment that have encouraged competition and the offering of integrated services 
we expect competition to intensify across all of our business segments as a result of the entrance of new competitors or the expansion of services offered by existing competitors  and the rapid development of new technologies  products and services 
we cannot predict which of many possible future technologies  products  or services will be important to maintain our competitive position or what expenditures we will be required to make in order to develop and provide these technologies  products or services 
to the extent we do not keep pace with technological advances or fail to timely respond to changes in the competitive environment affecting our industry  we could lose market share or experience a decline in revenue  cash flows and net income 
as a result of the financial strength and benefits of scale enjoyed by some of our competitors  they may be able to offer services at lower prices than we can  thereby adversely affecting our revenues  growth and profitability 

table of contents if we are unable to continue to improve our results of operations  we face the possibility of additional charges for impairments of long lived or indefinite lived assets 
further  our future operating results will be impacted by our share of clearwire net loss or net income  which during this period of their network build out will likely negatively affect our results of operations 
the carrying value of our investment in clearwire may be subject to impairment 
we review our wireless and wireline long lived assets for impairment when changes in circumstances indicate that the book amount may not be recoverable 
if we are unable to continue to improve our results of operations and cash flows  a review could lead to a material impairment in our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  if we continue to have challenges retaining subscribers and as we continue to assess the impact of rebanding the iden network  management may conclude in future periods that certain cdma and iden assets will never be either deployed or redeployed  in which case cash and non cash charges that could be material to our consolidated financial statements would be recognized 
we account for our investment in clearwire using the equity method of accounting and  as a result  we record our share of clearwire net income or net loss  which could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 
clearwire disclosed it would be required to raise additional capital in the near term in order to continue its current operations  and that as of september   there was substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern 
in december  clearwire successfully raised billion in debt financing 
as a result of this action  as of december   clearwire no longer reported substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern 
clearwire ability  however  to raise sufficient additional capital in the long term on acceptable terms  or at all  remains uncertain 
clearwire inability to obtain sufficient additional funding to continue its current operations may have an adverse effect on its estimated fair value based  in part  on its publicly quoted stock price 
a decline in the value of clearwire may require sprint to evaluate the decline in relation to sprint carrying value of its investment in clearwire 
a conclusion by sprint that a decline in the value of clearwire is other than temporary could result in a material impairment in our consolidated financial statements 
if motorola is unable or unwilling to provide us with equipment and devices in support of our iden based services  as well as improvements  our operations will be adversely affected 
motorola is our sole source for all of the devices we offer under the nextel brand  except blackberry devices 
although our handset supply agreement with motorola is structured to provide competitively priced devices  the cost of iden devices is generally higher than devices that do not incorporate a similar multi function capability 
this difference may make it more difficult or costly for us to offer devices at prices that are attractive to potential subscribers 
in addition  the higher cost of iden devices requires us to absorb a larger part of the cost of offering devices to new and existing subscribers  which may reduce our growth and profitability 
also  we must rely on motorola to develop devices capable of supporting the features and services we offer to subscribers of services on our iden network and to provide maintenance and support for our iden based infrastructure 
a decision by motorola to discontinue  or the inability of either company to continue manufacturing  maintaining or supporting our iden based infrastructure and devices could have a material adverse effect on us 
further  our ability to complete the spectrum reconfiguration plan in connection with the fcc report and order is dependent  in part  on motorola 
we have entered into agreements with unrelated parties for certain business operations 
any difficulties experienced in these arrangements could result in additional expense  loss of subscribers and revenue  interruption of our services or a delay in the roll out of new technology 
we have entered into agreements with unrelated parties for the day to day execution of services  provisioning and maintenance for our cdma  iden and wireline networks  for the implementation of network vision  and for the development and maintenance of certain software systems necessary for the operation of our business 
we also have agreements with unrelated parties to provide customer service and related support to our wireless subscribers and outsourced aspects of our wireline network and back office functions to unrelated parties 
in addition  we have sublease agreements with unrelated parties for space on communications towers 
as a result  we must rely on unrelated parties to perform certain of our operations and  in certain circumstances  interface with our subscribers 
if these unrelated parties were unable to perform to our requirements  we would have to pursue alternative strategies to provide these services and that could result in delays  interruptions  additional expenses and loss of subscribers 
the products and services utilized by us and our suppliers and service providers may infringe on intellectual property rights owned by others 
some of our products and services use intellectual property that we own 
we also purchase products from suppliers  including device suppliers  and outsource services to service providers  including billing and customer care functions  that incorporate or utilize intellectual property 
we and some of our suppliers and service providers have received  and may receive in the future  assertions and claims from third parties that the products or software utilized by us or our suppliers and service providers infringe on the patents or other intellectual property rights of these third parties 
these claims could require us or an infringing supplier or service provider to cease certain activities or to cease selling the relevant products and services 
these claims and assertions also could subject us to costly litigation and significant liabilities for damages or royalty payments  or require us to cease certain activities or to cease selling certain products and services 

table of contents for example  we obtain some of our cdma handsets from htc corp 
apple inc has filed an action with the international trade commission itc and with u 
s district courts accusing htc of patent infringement 
htc has filed an action against apple with the itc accusing apple of infringing htc patents 
apple claims against htc  if successful  could require us to cease providing certain products 
government regulation could adversely affect our prospects and results of operations  the fcc and state regulatory commissions may adopt new regulations or take other actions that could adversely affect our business prospects  future growth or results of operations 
the fcc and other federal  state and local  as well as international  governmental authorities have jurisdiction over our business and could adopt regulations or take other actions that would adversely affect our business prospects or results of operations 
the licensing  construction  operation  sale and interconnection arrangements of wireless telecommunications systems are regulated by the fcc and  depending on the jurisdiction  international  state and local regulatory agencies 
in particular  the fcc imposes significant regulation on licensees of wireless spectrum with respect to how radio spectrum is used by licensees  the nature of the services that licensees may offer and how the services may be offered  and resolution of issues of interference between spectrum bands 
the fcc grants wireless licenses for terms of generally ten years that are subject to renewal and revocation 
there is no guarantee that our licenses will be renewed 
failure to comply with fcc requirements in a given license area could result in revocation of the license for that license area 
depending on their outcome  the fcc proceedings regarding regulation of special access rates could affect the rates paid by our wireless and wireline segments for special access services in the future 
similarly  depending on their outcome  the fcc proceedings on the regulatory classification of voip services could affect the intercarrier compensation rates and the level of usf contributions paid by us 
various states are considering regulations over terms and conditions of service  including certain billing practices and consumer related issues that may not be pre empted by federal law 
if imposed  these regulations could make it more difficult and expensive to implement national sales and marketing programs and could increase the costs of our wireless operations 
degradation in network performance caused by compliance with government regulation  loss of spectrum or additional rules associated with the use of spectrum in any market could result in an inability to attract new subscribers or higher subscriber churn in that market  which could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
in addition  additional costs or fees imposed by governmental regulation could adversely affect our revenues  future growth and results of operations 
proposed regulatory developments regarding the use of conflict minerals mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries could affect the sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of certain products  including handsets 
although we do not buy raw materials  manufacture  or produce any electronic equipment directly  the proposed regulation may affect some of our suppliers 
as a result  there may only be a limited pool of suppliers who provide conflict free metals  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices 
also  because our supply chain is complex  we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all metals used in the products that we sell 
if our business partners and subscribers fail to meet their contractual obligations it could negatively affect our results of operations 
the current economic environment has made it difficult for businesses and consumers to obtain credit  which could cause our suppliers  distributors and subscribers to have problems meeting their contractual obligations with us 
if our suppliers are unable to fulfill our orders or meet their contractual obligations with us  we may not have the services or devices available to meet the needs of our current and future subscribers  which could cause us to lose current and potential subscribers to other carriers 
in addition  if our distributors are unable to stay in business  we could lose distribution points  which could negatively affect our business and results of operations 
finally  if our subscribers are unable to pay their bills or potential subscribers feel they are unable to take on additional financial obligations  they may be forced to forgo our services  which could negatively affect our results of operations 
our business could be negatively impacted by security threats and other disruptions 
major equipment failures  natural disasters  including severe weather  terrorist acts  cyber attacks or other breaches of network or information technology security that affect our wireline and wireless networks  including transport facilities  communications switches  routers  microwave links  cell sites or other equipment or third party owned local and long distance networks on which we rely  could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
these events could disrupt our operations  require significant resources  result in a loss of subscribers or impair our ability to attract new subscribers  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents concerns about health risks associated with wireless equipment may reduce the demand for our services 
portable communications devices have been alleged to pose health risks  including cancer  due to radio frequency emissions from these devices 
purported class actions and other lawsuits have been filed against numerous wireless carriers  including us  seeking not only damages but also remedies that could increase our cost of doing business 
we cannot be sure of the outcome of those cases or that our business and financial condition will not be adversely affected by litigation of this nature or public perception about health risks 
the actual or perceived risk of mobile communications devices could adversely affect us through a reduction in subscribers  reduced network usage per subscriber or reduced financing available to the mobile communications industry 
further research and studies are ongoing  and we cannot guarantee that additional studies will not demonstrate a link between radio frequency emissions and health concerns 
risks related to our investment in clearwire we are a majority shareholder of clearwire  a term we use to refer to the consolidated entity of clearwire corporation and its subsidiary clearwire communications llc 
under this section  we have included certain important risk factors with respect to our investment in clearwire 
for more discussion of clearwire and the risks affecting clearwire  you should refer to clearwire annual report on form k for the year ended december  our investment in clearwire exposes us to risks because we do not control the board  determine the strategies  manage operations or control management  including decisions relating to the build out and operation of a g network  and the value of our investment in clearwire or our financial performance may be adversely affected by decisions made by clearwire or other large investors in clearwire that are adverse to our interests 
although we have the ability to nominate seven of clearwire directors  at least one of our nominees must be an independent director 
thus  we do not control the board  and we do not manage the operations of clearwire or control management 
clearwire has a group of investors that have been provided with representation on clearwire board of directors 
these investors may have interests that diverge from ours or clearwire 
differences in views among the large investors could result in delayed decisions by clearwire board of directors or failure to agree on major issues 
any differences in our views or problems with respect to the operation of clearwire could have a material adverse effect on the value of our investment in clearwire or our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
see also current economic conditions  our recent financial performance and our debt ratings could negatively impact our access to the capital markets resulting in less growth than planned or failure to satisfy financial covenants under our existing debt agreements 
moreover  clearwire may be considered a subsidiary under certain agreements relating to our indebtedness 
in addition  the corporate opportunity provisions in clearwire restated certificate of incorporation provide that unless a director is an employee of clearwire  the person does not have a duty to present to clearwire a corporate opportunity of which the director becomes aware  except where the corporate opportunity is expressly offered to the director in his or her capacity as a director of clearwire 
this could enable certain clearwire shareholders to benefit from opportunities that may otherwise be available to clearwire  which could adversely affect clearwire business and our investment in clearwire 
clearwire restated certificate of incorporation also expressly provides that certain shareholders and their affiliates may  and have no duty not to  engage in any businesses that are similar to or competitive with those of clearwire  do business with clearwire competitors  subscribers and suppliers  and employ clearwire employees or officers 
these shareholders or their affiliates may deploy competing wireless broadband networks or purchase broadband services from other providers 
any such actions could have a material adverse effect on clearwire business  financial condition  results of operations or prospects and the value of our investment in clearwire

table of contents item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview business strategies and key priorities sprint is a communications company offering a comprehensive range of wireless and wireline communications products and services that are designed to meet the needs of individual consumers  businesses  government subscribers and resellers 
the communications industry has been and will continue to be highly competitive on the basis of price  the types of services and devices offered and the quality of service 
as discussed below in effects on our wireless business of postpaid subscriber losses  the company has experienced significant losses of subscribers in the critical postpaid wireless market since the third quarter  but  as a result of steps taken to attract and retain such subscribers  has reduced net subscriber losses beginning in our business strategy is to be responsive to changing customer mobility demands by being innovative and differentiated in the marketplace 
our future growth plans and strategy revolve around achieving the following three key priorities improve the customer experience  strengthen our brands  and generate operating cash flow 
we have reduced confusion over pricing plans and complex bills with our simply everything and everything data plans and our any mobile anytime sm feature that offer savings compared to our competition 
in addition to savings offered to consumers  business advantage pricing plans are available to our business subscribers who can also take advantage of any mobile anytime sm with certain plans 
to simplify and improve the customer experience  we introduced the sprint free guarantee  which gives any customer opening a new line of service the chance to try sprint for days for free excluding overages and premium services not included in price plans 
in addition  we have continued to offer ready now  which trains our customers before they leave the store on how to use their mobile devices 
for our business customers  we aim to increase their productivity by providing differentiated services that utilize the advantages of combining ip networks with wireless technology 
this differentiation enables us to acquire and retain both wireline  wireless and combined wireline wireless subscribers on our networks 
we have also continued to focus on further improving customer care 
we implemented initiatives that are designed to improve call center processes and procedures  and standardized our performance measures through various metrics  including customer satisfaction ratings with respect to customer care  first call resolution and calls per subscriber 
our product strategy is to provide our customers with a broad array of device selections and applications and services that run on these devices to meet the growing needs of customer mobility 
our multi functional device portfolio includes devices such as the samsung epic g android device  which can also act as a mobile hotspot for up to five wireless fidelity wifi enabled devices and the world first g g android device  the htc evo g  which can also act as a mobile hotspot for up to eight wifi enabled devices 
our portfolio also includes the motorola i which is the world first direct connect android powered smartphone 
other devices in our portfolio are the htc hero and the samsung moment with google  the blackberry and blackberry bold  the samsung seek  the rumor touch from lg and the touch pro from htc 
our mobile broadband device portfolio consists of devices such as the overdrive g g mobile hotspot  which allows the connection of up to five wifi enabled devices  the sprint g usb u and the ovation u by novatel wireless 
we support the open development of applications and content on our network platforms 
we also enable a variety of third party providers  location based services and business and consumer product providers through our machine to machine initiative 
the machine to machine initiative incorporates selling  marketing  product development and operations resources to address growing non traditional data needs  which covers a wide variety of products and services including remote monitoring  telematics  in vehicle devices  e readers  specialized medical devices and other original equipment manufacturer devices 
our prepaid portfolio launched additional brands in the second quarter sprint prepaid portfolio currently includes four brands  each designed to appeal to specific customer segments 
boost mobile serves customers who are voice and text messaging centric with its popular monthly unlimited plan with shrinkage service where bills are reduced after six on time payments 
virgin mobile serves customers who are device and data oriented with beyond talk plans and our broadband plan  broadbandgo  that offer consumers control  flexibility and connectivity through various communication vehicles 
assurance wireless provides eligible customers  who meet income requirements or are receiving government assistance  with a free wireless phone and free minutes of national local and long distance monthly service 
common cents sm mobile caters to budget conscious customers with cent minutes that round down and cent text messages 
sprint has focused its wholesale business as a reseller of new converged services that leverage the sprint network but are sold under the wholesaler brand by providing a suite of integrated and customizeable value added solutions focused on assisting our customers to improve their business 
we have adopted new pricing models  made it easier for our wholesalers to acquire access and resell our services by bundling wireless and wireline services and focused our attention to partners with existing distribution channels 
in addition  we have strengthened our sales efforts and expanded to new markets in the rapidly 
table of contents growing machine to machine space 
in addition to our brand and customer oriented goals  we have also taken steps  beginning in  to generate increased operating cash flow through competitive new rate plans for postpaid and prepaid subscribers  multi branded strategies and reductions to our cost structure to align with the reduced revenues from fewer postpaid subscribers 
our cost reductions are primarily attributable to reductions in capital spending  workforce reductions  call center closures as a result of fewer calls per subscriber and limiting marketing spend to focused initiatives 
we believe these actions  as well as our continued efforts to reduce other operating expenses  will allow us to continue to maintain an adequate cash position 
network vision in december  sprint announced network vision  a multi year network infrastructure initiative intended to provide customers with an enhanced network experience by improving voice quality and providing faster data speeds  while creating network flexibility  reducing operating costs  and improving environmental sustainability by enabling the aggregation of multiple spectrum bands onto a single multi mode base station 
in addition to implementing these multi mode base stations  this plan encompasses next generation push to talk technology with broadband capabilities and the integration of multi mode chipsets into smartphones  tablets and other broadband devices  including machine to machine capabilities 
consolidating and optimizing the use of sprint mhz  ghz and potentially other spectrum such as the ghz owned by clearwire into multi mode stations should allow sprint to repurpose spectrum to enhance coverage  particularly around the in building experience 
the multi mode technology also utilizes software based solutions with interchangeable hardware to provide greater network flexibility  which allows for opportunities to evaluate new g technologies to better utilize sprint available spectrum 
the first stages of equipment testing are expected to begin in early and  if successful  broad scale deployment is expected in the latter half of with an expected completion time of anywhere from three to five years 
as network vision is implemented  the size and power required to operate cell sites used by sprint is expected to be reduced 
sprint expects the plan to bring financial benefit to the company through convergence to one common network  which is expected to reduce network maintenance and operating costs through capital efficiencies  reduced energy costs  lower roaming expenses  backhaul savings and the eventual reduction in total cell sites and also by reducing the cost of handling expanded data traffic 
sprint has entered into agreements relating to network vision to deploy a cost effective  innovative network to enhance the voice quality and data speeds by consolidating multiple technologies into one network 
the successful testing and deployment related to these changes in technology will result in incremental charges during the period of implementation including  but not limited to  an increase in depreciation and amortization associated with existing iden assets due to changes in our estimates of the remaining useful lives of long lived assets  and the expected timing of asset retirement obligations  which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
the successful testing of push to talk technology on the cdma network in our test markets in would result in increased depreciation and amortization expense expected to range from billion to billion if implementation can be completed by the end of successful completion of network vision earlier or later than the end of would result in an acceleration or delay  respectively  of these depreciation and amortization costs 
effects on our wireless business of postpaid subscriber losses the following table shows annual net additions losses of postpaid subscribers for the past five years  excluding subscribers obtained through business combinations 
year ended december  in thousands total net additions losses of postpaid subscribers as shown by the table below under results of operations  wireless segment earnings represents approximately of sprint total consolidated segment earnings 
the wireless industry is subject to intense competition to acquire and retain subscribers of wireless services 
most markets in which we operate have high rates of penetration for wireless services 
wireless carriers accordingly must attract a greater proportion of new subscribers from competitors rather than from first time subscribers 
within the wireless segment  postpaid wireless voice and data services represent the most significant contributors to earnings  and are driven by the number of postpaid subscribers to our services  as well as the average revenue per subscriber or user arpu 

table of contents beginning in  in conjunction with changes in senior management  sprint undertook steps to address and reduce postpaid subscriber losses 
perceptions in the marketplace  in part as a result of the subscriber losses themselves  as well as other factors  reduced the sprint brand effectiveness in attracting and retaining customers 
steps were taken to improve the sprint networks  as well as to improve the quality of sprint customer care experience  as confirmed by independent comparisons with competitors 
steps were also taken to improve the credit quality mix of our subscriber base and to improve our financial stability  including cost control actions  which have resulted in our continuing strong cash flow from operations 
in addition  beginning in and continuing through  we have undertaken initiatives to strengthen the sprint brand 
we continue to increase market awareness of the improvements that have been achieved in the customer experience  including the speed and dependability of our networks 
we have also introduced new devices improving our overall lineup and providing a competitive portfolio for customer selection  as well as competitive new rate plans providing simplicity and value 
we believe these actions had a favorable impact on net postpaid subscriber losses in and  and we expect these to further improve our subscriber results 
beginning in the second quarter and continuing through  the company has begun to see a reduction in our net loss of postpaid subscribers 
for the year ended december   net postpaid subscriber losses of  improved by million  or compared to losses of million in the net loss of postpaid subscribers in and can be expected to cause wireless service revenue in to be approximately billion lower than it would have been had those subscribers not been lost 
notwithstanding our historical postpaid subscriber losses  consolidated service revenue has begun to stabilize primarily as a result of increased service revenue associated with our prepaid wireless offerings  including the acquisition of virgin mobile in the fourth quarter of as a result  sprint prepaid wireless offerings  as well as cost controls that have been implemented  will continue to partially offset the effects of net postpaid subscriber losses  but are unlikely to be sufficient to sustain the company level of results from operations and cash flows unless we are successful in further improving our postpaid subscriber results 
if our trend of improved postpaid subscriber results does not continue  it could have a material negative impact on our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity in and beyond 
the company believes the actions that have been taken  as described above  and that continue to be taken in marketing  customer service  device offerings  and network quality  should continue to reduce the number of net postpaid subscriber losses experienced during results of operations year ended december  in millions wireless segment earnings wireline segment earnings corporate  other and eliminations consolidated segment earnings depreciation and amortization goodwill impairment merger and integration expenses other  net operating loss interest expense  net equity in losses of unconsolidated investments  net other income  net income tax expense benefit net loss consolidated results of operations include the results of our next generation wireless broadband network  which was contributed to clearwire in a transaction that closed on november  consolidated segment earnings decreased million  or  in compared to and billion  or  in compared to consolidated segment earnings consist of our wireless and wireline segments  which are discussed below  and corporate  other and eliminations

these reductions were partially offset by an increase in amortization related to customer relationship intangible assets acquired in connection with the ipcs  inc ipcs and virgin mobile acquisitions in the fourth quarter customer relationships are amortized using the sum of the years digits method  resulting in higher amortization rates in early periods that decline over time 
goodwill impairment and merger and integration expenses the company recognized a non cash goodwill impairment of million during the impaired goodwill was primarily attributable to the company acquisition of nextel in and reflects the reduction in the estimated fair value of sprint wireless reporting unit subsequent to the acquisition resulting from  among other factors  net losses of postpaid subscribers

segment earnings wireless wireless segment earnings are primarily a function of wireless service revenue  costs to acquire subscribers  network and interconnection costs to serve those subscribers and other wireless segment operating expenses 
the costs to acquire our subscribers include the net cost at which we sell our devices  referred to as subsidies  as well as the marketing and sales costs incurred to attract those subscribers 
network costs primarily represent switch and cell site costs and interconnection costs  which generally consist of per minute usage fees and roaming fees paid to other carriers 
the remaining costs associated with operating the wireless segment include the costs to operate our customer care organization and administrative support 
wireless service revenue  costs to acquire subscribers  and variable network and interconnection costs fluctuate with the changes in our subscriber base and their related usage  but some cost elements do not fluctuate in the short term with these changes

the ability of our wireless segment to generate service revenues is primarily a function of revenue generated from each subscriber  which in turn is a function of the types and amount of services utilized by each subscriber and the rates charged for those services  and the number of subscribers that we serve  which in turn is a function of our ability to acquire new and retain existing subscribers 
retail comprises those subscribers to whom sprint directly provides wireless services on our networks or networks we utilize through mvno relationships  such as our relationship with clearwire  whether those services are provided on a postpaid or a prepaid basis

year ended december  subscribers in thousands average postpaid subscribers average prepaid subscribers average monthly service revenue per subscriber postpaid prepaid average retail average subscribers include subscribers acquired through business combinations prospectively from the date of acquisition 
average subscribers for the years ended december  and are inclusive of prepaid and postpaid subscribers acquired through our business combinations of virgin mobile and ipcs  which were previously included within wholesale and affiliate subscribers 
in addition  average prepaid subscribers for the same periods are exclusive of  subscribers transferred to wholesale and affiliates as a result of a sale and transfer of customers to an affiliate in average monthly service revenue per subscriber is calculated by dividing service revenue by the sum of the average number of subscribers 
changes in average monthly service revenue reflect subscribers who change rate plans  the level of voice and data usage  the amount of service credits which are offered to subscribers  plus the net effect of average monthly revenue generated by new subscribers and deactivating subscribers 
average monthly postpaid service revenue per subscriber for declined slightly as compared to due to declines in overage revenues resulting from the increased popularity of fixed rate bundled plans including the any mobile anytime sm feature 
average monthly retail postpaid service revenue per subscriber was stable for compared to as a result of improved retention of higher revenue subscribers on bundled rate plans offset by lower overage and roaming revenues 
average monthly prepaid service revenue per subscriber for decreased compared to due to prepaid subscribers acquired in our fourth quarter business combination of virgin mobile as well as net subscriber additions under our assurance wireless brand launched in early  which carry a lower average revenue per subscriber compared to sprint other prepaid subscribers 
average monthly prepaid service revenue per subscriber increased during as compared to due to higher revenue from our national boost monthly unlimited users combined with more stable average revenue per subscriber from our traditional prepaid users

reflects the transfer of  prepaid and  postpaid subscribers from wholesale and affiliates as a result of the business combinations completed in the fourth quarter as well as the third quarter transfer of  wholesale and affiliates subscribers from prepaid as a result of a sale and transfer of customers to an affiliate 
churn is calculated by dividing net subscriber deactivations for the quarter by the sum of the average number of subscribers for each month in the quarter 
for postpaid accounts comprising multiple subscribers  such as family plans and enterprise accounts  net deactivations are defined as deactivations in excess of customer activations in a particular account within days 
postpaid and prepaid churn consist of both voluntary churn  where the subscriber makes his or her own determination to cease being a customer  and involuntary churn  where the customer service is terminated due to a lack of payment or other reasons 

table of contents retail postpaid subscribers we lost  net postpaid subscribers during as compared to losing million and million net postpaid subscribers during and  respectively 
our improvement in net postpaid subscriber losses year over year can be attributed to our improvements in retail postpaid gross adds and lower postpaid churn resulting from simplified and value driven bundled offers  a more competitive device line up  as well as our continued improvements in overall customer experience and customer care satisfaction 
retail prepaid subscribers we added approximately million net prepaid subscribers during as compared to adding million and losing  net prepaid subscribers in and  respectively 
our net prepaid subscriber additions in were principally driven by net additions from the assurance wireless and boost mobile brands  partially offset by net losses associated with the virgin mobile brand including a transfer of  subscribers from prepaid to wholesale and affiliates as a result of a sale and transfer of customers to an affiliate 
our net prepaid subscriber additions in as compared to losses in were principally driven by the boost monthly unlimited plan 
prepaid subscribers are generally deactivated between days and up to days from the date of activation or replenishment  however  prior to account deactivation  targeted retention programs can be offered to qualifying subscribers to maintain ongoing service by providing up to an additional days to make a replenishment 
subscribers targeted through these retention offers are not included in the calculation of churn until their retention offer expires without a replenishment to their account 
as a result  end of period prepaid subscribers include subscribers engaged in these retention programs 
retention offers to these targeted subscribers remained consistent as a percentage of our total prepaid subscriber base during wholesale and affiliate subscribers wholesale and affiliate subscribers represent customers that are served on our networks through companies that resell our services to their subscribers  customers residing in affiliate territories and a growing portion of subscribers from our machine to machine initiative primarily representing devices that utilize our network 
during  wholesale and affiliate subscriber additions were  resulting in approximately million wholesale and affiliate subscribers as of december   compared to approximately million and million wholesale and affiliate subscribers as of december  and  respectively 
the increase in the wholesale subscriber base was primarily due to subscriber additions in other mvno relationships during the decrease from to was primarily due to subscribers transferred to postpaid and prepaid as result of the fourth quarter business combinations of virgin mobile and ipcs 
of the remaining million subscribers included in wholesale and affiliate  approximately represent machine to machine activities such as e readers  in vehicle devices and telematics 
subscribers through some of our mvno relationships have inactivity either in voice usage or primarily as a result of the nature of the device  where activity only occurs when data retrieval is initiated by the end user and may occur infrequently 
although we continue to provide these customers access to our network through our mvno relationships  approximately  subscribers through these mvno relationships have been inactive for at least six months  with no associated revenue 
cost of services cost of services consists primarily of costs to operate and maintain our cdma and iden networks  including direct switch and cell site costs  such as rent  utilities  maintenance  labor costs associated with network employees and spectrum frequency leasing costs  fixed and variable interconnection costs  the fixed component of which consists of monthly flat rate fees for facilities leased from local exchange carriers based on the number of cell sites and switches in service in a particular period and the related equipment installed at each site  and the variable component of which generally consists of per minute use fees charged by wireline providers for calls terminating on their networks  which fluctuate in relation to the level and duration of those terminating calls  long distance costs paid to the wireline segment  costs to service and repair devices  regulatory fees  roaming fees paid to other carriers  and fixed and variable costs relating to payments to third parties for the use of their proprietary data applications  such as messaging  music  tv and navigation services by our subscribers 
cost of services decreased million  or  in compared to  primarily reflecting a decline in service and repair costs by focusing on device repairs and refurbishment rather than utilizing new devices  a decline in long distance network costs as a result of lower market rates as well as a decline in payments to third party vendors providing premium services as a result of changing from usage based payments to flat rates 
this decline was partially offset by increased roaming due to higher data usage and an increase in license fees as a result of the continued growth in smartphone devices  which carry higher fees 
cost of services decreased million  or  in as compared to primarily reflecting a decline in labor  outside services and maintenance costs consistent with the company cost cutting efforts  as well as a decline in network costs associated with fewer subscribers 

table of contents equipment net subsidy we recognize equipment revenue and corresponding costs of devices when title of the device passes to the dealer or end user customer 
our marketing plans assume that devices typically will be sold at prices below cost  which is consistent with industry practice  as subscriber retention efforts often include providing incentives to subscribers such as offering new devices at discounted prices 
we reduce equipment revenue for these discounts offered directly to the customer  or for certain payments to third party dealers to reimburse the dealer for point of sale discounts that are offered to the end user subscriber 
additionally  the cost of devices is reduced by any rebates that are earned from the supplier 
cost of devices and accessories also includes order fulfillment related expenses and write downs of device and related accessory inventory for shrinkage and obsolescence 
equipment cost in excess of the revenue generated from equipment sales is referred to in the industry as equipment net subsidy 
equipment revenue increased million  or  in compared to and cost of devices increased billion  or  in compared to the increase in both equipment revenue and cost of devices is primarily due to an increase in the number of postpaid devices sold with a greater mix of devices that have a higher average sales price and cost  as well as an increase in the number of prepaid devices sold 
equipment revenue decreased million  or  in compared to primarily due to declining average sales prices for devices with higher functionality as a result of competitive and economic pressures  partially offset by an increase in the number of lower priced prepaid devices sold in as compared to cost of devices increased million  or  in compared to  primarily due to our mix of devices sold reflecting a greater mix of postpaid devices sold with a higher functionality and an increase in the number of devices sold 
selling  general and administrative expense sales and marketing costs primarily consist of customer acquisition costs  including commissions paid to our indirect dealers  third party distributors and retail sales force for new device activations and upgrades  residual payments to our indirect dealers  payroll and facilities costs associated with our retail sales force  marketing employees  advertising  media programs and sponsorships  including costs related to branding 
general and administrative expenses primarily consist of costs for billing  customer care and information technology operations  bad debt expense and administrative support activities  including collections  legal  finance  human resources  strategic planning and technology and product development 
sales and marketing expense increased million  or  in from as compared to a decrease of million  or  in from the increase in sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december  is primarily due to the additional costs associated with our increase in subscriber gross additions combined with incremental costs associated with our business combinations in the fourth quarter  offset by a decline in marketing expenditures related to our cost cutting initiatives 
the decline in sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december  is primarily due to a decline in gross subscriber additions compared to and a decline in labor related costs due to our workforce and cost reduction activities 
general and administrative costs decreased million  or  in from and billion  or  in from the decline in general and administrative costs for the year ended december  reflects a reduction in customer care costs and minor continued effects of workforce reductions and cost cutting initiatives announced in offset by increases as a result of the fourth quarter business combinations of virgin mobile and ipcs in addition to an increase in bad debt expense 
the decline in general and administrative costs for the year ended december  is primarily due to reductions in customer care costs  the decrease in employee related costs as part of our cost cutting initiatives and lower bad debt expense 
customer care costs decreased million in as compared to and million in as compared to the improvement in customer care costs is largely attributable to customer care quality initiatives launched in that have resulted in a reduction in calls per subscriber by from peak levels which allowed for a reduction of call centers in and call centers in employee related costs in were consistent with and costs decreased approximately million in as compared to  due to workforce reductions announced in january and november bad debt expense was million for the year ended december  representing a million increase  as compared to bad debt expense of million in the increase in bad debt expense primarily reflects reductions in allowances for bad debt due to increased rates of recovery 
for the year ended december   bad debt expense decreased million as compared to bad debt expense of million in the improvement in bad debt expense resulted from lower rates of uncollectibility during the period  as well as lower estimated uncollectible accounts in outstanding accounts receivable 
we reassess our allowance for doubtful accounts quarterly 
changes in our allowance for doubtful accounts are largely attributable to credit policies established for subscribers and analysis of historical collection experience 
our mix of prime postpaid subscribers to total postpaid subscribers remained flat at as of december  and  respectively 

table of contents segment earnings wireline wireline segment earnings are primarily a function of wireline service revenue  network and interconnection costs and other wireline segment operating expenses 
network costs primarily represent special access costs and interconnection costs which generally consist of domestic and international per minute usage fees paid to other carriers 
the remaining costs associated with operating the wireline segment include the costs to operate our customer care and billing organizations in addition to administrative support 
wireline service revenue  and variable network and interconnection costs fluctuate with the changes in our customer base and their related usage  but some cost elements do not fluctuate in the short term with the changes in our customer usage 
our wireline services provided to our wireless segment are generally accounted for based on market rates which we believe approximate fair value 
the company generally re establishes these rates at the beginning of each fiscal year 
over the past several years  there has been an industry wide trend of lower rates due to increased competition from other wireline and wireless communications companies as well as cable and internet service providers 
for  we expect wireline service gross margin to decline by approximately to million to reflect changes in market prices for services provided by our wireline segment to our wireless segment 
this decline in wireline service gross margin related to intercompany pricing will not affect sprint consolidated results of operations as our wireless segment will benefit from an equivalent reduction in cost of service

internet revenues decreased million  or  in from as compared to an increase of million  or  in from the decrease was due to a decline in new ip customers with lower market rates as a result of increased competition 
the increase was due to higher ip revenues as business subscribers were increasing requirements to support wireless customer data traffic  in addition to revenue growth in cable voip  which experienced a increase in subscribers in as compared to internet revenues generated from the provision of services to the wireless segment represented of total internet revenues in as compared to in and in some mso are in the process of in sourcing their digital voice products for which the transition and associated revenue reductions will occur over the next several years with a decrease of approximately million to occur in

costs of services and products decreased million  or  in from and million  or  in from the decrease in and is primarily due to declining voice volumes and a shift in mix to lower cost products as a result of the migration from data to ip based technologies 
service gross margin percentage increased from in to in and decreased back to in the increase from to was primarily due to revenue growth in our cable voip business and a decrease in costs of services and products offset by a decrease in voice revenue 
the decrease from to was as a result of a decrease in net service revenue offset by a decrease in costs of services and products 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense decreased million  or  in as compared to and million  or in as compared the decreases were primarily due to a reduction in employee headcount and a decline in the use of outside services and maintenance as part of our cost cutting initiatives

these were partially offset by an increase of million in cash received for income tax refunds 
net cash provided by operating activities for also includes a cash payment of million resulting from a contribution to the company pension plan 
net cash provided by operating activities of billion in decreased by billion from  primarily due to a billion decrease in cash received from our subscribers as a result of declining service revenues from our loss of post paid subscribers and a million contribution to the company pension plan during these declines were offset by a decrease of billion in cash paid to our suppliers and employees primarily due to reductions in variable cost of services and products and selling  general and administrative expenses due to the various cost cutting initiatives implemented over the past year 
net cash provided by operating activities for is net of cash used for operating activities of approximately million that related to our operations that were contributed to clearwire in november investing activities net cash used in investing activities for decreased by billion from  due to a decrease of million in purchases of short term investments and a decrease of million in expenditures related to fcc licenses as determined by specific operations requirements of the report and order 
these decreases were partially offset by reduced proceeds from sales and maturities of short term investments of million and increased capital expenditures of million to add coverage and capacity to our wireless networks 
sprint also increased its investment in clearwire by billion and acquired ipcs and virgin mobile for million in  which resulted in the remaining decline in as compared to net cash used in investing activities for decreased by million from  primarily due to an increase of million in proceeds from short term investments and a decrease in capital expenditures of billion in as

as a result of the outstanding letters of credit  which directly reduce the availability of the revolving bank credit facility  we had million of borrowing capacity available under our revolving bank credit facility as of december  accordingly  sprint liquidity as of december   including cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility was billion 
in addition  in january  billion of sprint capital corporation senior notes were repaid upon maturity and we amended million of our million export development canada loan to extend the maturity date from to the terms and conditions of our revolving bank credit facility require the ratio of total indebtedness to trailing four quarters earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and certain other non recurring items  as defined by the credit facility adjusted ebitda  to be no more than to beginning in april  the ratio will be reduced to to  and further reduced to to in january as of december   the ratio was to as compared to to as of december  resulting from our decline in adjusted ebitda 
under this revolving bank credit facility  we are currently restricted from paying cash dividends because our ratio of total indebtedness to adjusted ebitda exceeds to the terms of the revolving bank credit facility provide for an interest rate equal to the london interbank offered rate libor  plus a margin of between and  depending on our debt ratings 
certain of our domestic subsidiaries have guaranteed the revolving bank credit facility 
a default under our borrowings could trigger defaults under our other debt obligations  which in turn could result in the maturities being accelerated 
certain indentures that govern our outstanding notes also require compliance with various covenants  including limitations on the incurrence of indebtedness and liens by the company and its subsidiaries  as defined by the terms of the indentures 
as of december   we own a economic interest in clearwire 
as a result  clearwire could be considered a subsidiary under certain agreements relating to our indebtedness 
whether clearwire could be considered a subsidiary under our debt agreements is subject to interpretation 
in december  as a result of an amendment to the clearwire equityholders agreement  sprint obtained the right to unilaterally surrender voting securities to reduce its voting security percentage below  which could eliminate the potential for clearwire to be considered a subsidiary of sprint 

table of contents certain actions or defaults by clearwire would  if viewed as a subsidiary  result in a breach of covenants  including potential cross default provisions  under certain agreements relating to our indebtedness 
however  we believe the unilateral rights obtained in december significantly mitigate the possibility of an event that would cross default against sprint debt obligations 
we expect to remain in compliance with our covenants through at least the end of  although there can be no assurance that we will do so 
although we expect to improve our postpaid subscriber results  if we do not meet our plan  depending on the severity of the actual subscriber results versus what we currently anticipate  it is possible that we would not remain in compliance with our covenants or be able to meet our debt service obligations  which could result in acceleration of our indebtedness 
if such unforeseen events occur  we may engage with our lenders to obtain appropriate waivers or amendments of our credit facilities or refinance borrowings  although there is no assurance we would be successful in any of these actions 
sprint current liquidity position makes it likely that we will be able to meet our debt service requirements and other funding needs currently identified through at least the end of by using our anticipated cash flows from operating activities as well as our cash and cash equivalents on hand 
in addition  we also have available the remaining borrowing capacity under our revolving bank credit facility 
nevertheless  if we are unable to continue to reduce the rate of losses of postpaid subscribers  it could have a significant negative impact on cash provided by operating activities and our liquidity in future years 
in determining that we expect to meet our funding needs through at least  we have considered expenses relating to our operations  anticipated levels of capital expenditures  including the capacity and upgrading of our networks and the deployment of new technologies in our networks  and fcc license acquisitions  anticipated payments under the report and order  as supplemented  any contributions we may make to our pension plan  scheduled debt service requirements  any additional investment we may choose to make in clearwire  and other future contractual obligations and general corporate expenditures 
any of these events or circumstances could involve significant additional funding needs in excess of anticipated cash flows from operating activities and the identified currently available funding sources  including existing cash and cash equivalents and borrowings available under our existing revolving credit facility 
if existing capital resources are not sufficient to meet these funding needs  it would be necessary to raise additional capital to meet those needs 
our ability to fund our capital needs from outside sources is ultimately affected by the overall capacity and terms of the banking and securities markets  as well as our performance and our credit ratings 
given our recent financial performance as well as the volatility in these markets  we continue to monitor them closely and to take steps to maintain financial flexibility and a reasonable cost of capital 
as of december   moody investor service  standard poor ratings services  and fitch ratings had assigned the following credit ratings to certain of our outstanding obligations rating rating agency senior unsecured bank credit facility senior unsecured debt outlook moody baa ba under review standard and poor not rated bb negative fitch bb bb negative downgrades of our current ratings do not accelerate scheduled principal payments of our existing debt 
however  downgrades may cause us to incur higher interest costs on our credit facilities and future borrowings  if any  and could negatively impact our access to the public capital markets 
as of december   we had working capital of billion compared to billion as of december  
table of contents current business outlook we endeavor to both add new and retain our existing wireless subscribers in order to reverse the net loss in postpaid wireless subscribers that we have experienced 
we expect to improve our subscriber trends by continuing to improve the customer experience and through offers which provide value  simplicity and productivity 
given the current economic environment  the difficulties the economic uncertainties create in forecasting  as well as the inherent uncertainties in predicting future customer behavior  we are unable to forecast with assurance the net retail postpaid subscriber results we will experience during or thereafter 
however  the company expects postpaid subscriber net additions for the full year and to improve total wireless subscriber net additions in  as compared to our net subscriber losses have significantly reduced our revenue and operating cash flow 
these effects will continue if we do not continue to attract new subscribers and or reduce our rate of churn 
see effects on our wireless business of postpaid subscriber losses above for a discussion of how our subscriber trends will impact our segment earnings trends 
also  subscriber losses will further decrease our adjusted ebitda  as defined by our revolving bank credit facility 
management implemented cost reduction programs designed to decrease our cost structure by reducing our labor and other costs  however  we do not expect that the reduction in costs will fully offset the revenue declines described above 
the above discussion is subject to the risks and other cautionary and qualifying factors set forth under forward looking statements and part i  item a risk factors in this report 

table of contents future contractual obligations the following table sets forth our best estimates as to the amounts and timing of contractual payments as of december  future events  including additional purchases of our securities and refinancing of those securities  could cause actual payments to differ significantly from these amounts 
see forward looking statements 
future contractual obligations total and thereafter in millions senior notes  bank credit facilities and debentures capital leases and financing obligation operating leases purchase orders and other commitments total includes principal and estimated interest payments 
interest payments are based on management expectations for future interest rates 
in january  million of our million export development canada loan was amended to extend the maturity date from to  which is not reflected in the table above 
represents capital lease payments including interest and financing obligation related to the sale and subsequent leaseback of multiple tower sites 
includes future lease costs related to cell and switch sites  real estate  network equipment and office space 
includes service  spectrum  network capacity and other executory contracts 
excludes blanket purchase orders in the amount of million 
see below for further discussion 
purchase orders and other commitments include minimum purchases we commit to purchase from suppliers over time and or the unconditional purchase obligations where we guarantee to make a minimum payment to suppliers for goods and services regardless of whether suppliers fully deliver them 
amounts actually paid under some of these other agreements will likely be higher due to variable components of these agreements 
the more significant variable components that determine the ultimate obligation owed include hours contracted  subscribers and other factors 
in addition  we are party to various arrangements that are conditional in nature and create an obligation to make payments only upon the occurrence of certain events  such as the delivery of functioning software or products 
because it is not possible to predict the timing or amounts that may be due under these conditional arrangements  no such amounts have been included in the table above 
the table above also excludes about million of blanket purchase order amounts since their agreement terms are not specified 
no time frame is set for these purchase orders and they are not legally binding 
as a result  they are not firm commitments 
our liability for uncertain tax positions was million as of december  due to the inherent uncertainty of the timing of the resolution of the underlying tax positions  it is not practicable to assign this liability to any particular year s in the table 
the table above does not include remaining costs to be paid in connection with the fulfillment of our obligations under the report and order 
the report and order requires us to make a payment to the us treasury at the conclusion of the band reconfiguration process to the extent that the value of the ghz spectrum we received exceeds the total of the value of licenses for spectrum in the mhz and mhz bands that we surrendered under the decision plus the actual costs  or qualifying costs  that we incur to retune incumbents and our own facilities 
the total minimum cash obligation for the report and order is billion 
from the inception of the program through december   we have incurred approximately billion of costs directly attributable to the spectrum reconfiguration program 
this amount does not include any of our internal network costs that we have preliminarily allocated to the reconfiguration program for capacity sites and modifications for which we may request credit under the reconfiguration program 
we estimate  based on our experience to date with the reconfiguration program and on information currently available  that our total direct costs attributable to complete the spectrum reconfigurations will range between and billion 
accordingly  we believe that it is unlikely that we will be required to make a payment to the us treasury 
off balance sheet financing we do not participate in  or secure  financings for any unconsolidated  special purpose entities 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates sprint applies those accounting policies that management believes best reflect the underlying business and economic events  consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
sprint more critical accounting policies include those related to the basis of presentation  allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation and recoverability of our equity method investment in clearwire  valuation and recoverability of long lived assets  evaluation of goodwill and indefinite lived assets for impairment  and accruals for taxes based on income 
inherent in such policies are certain key assumptions and estimates made by management 
management periodically updates its estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements based on its latest assessment of the current and projected business and general economic environment 
these critical accounting policies have been discussed with sprint board of directors 
sprint significant accounting policies are summarized in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
basis of presentation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of sprint and its consolidated subsidiaries 
investments where sprint maintains majority ownership  but lacks full decision making ability over all major issues  are accounted for using the equity method 
governance for sprint major unconsolidated investment  clearwire  is based on clearwire board representation for which sprint does not have a majority vote 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that result from failure of our subscribers to make required payments 
our estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts considers a number of factors  including collection experience  aging of the accounts receivable portfolios  credit quality of the subscriber base  estimated proceeds from future bad debt sales and other qualitative considerations 
to the extent that actual loss experience differs significantly from historical trends  the required allowance amounts could differ from our estimate 
a change in the amount estimated to be uncollectible would result in a corresponding change in bad debt expense of about million for the wireless segment and million for the wireline segment 
valuation and recoverability of our equity method investment in clearwire we assess our equity method investment for other than temporary impairment when indicators such as decline in quoted prices in active markets indicate a value below the carrying value of our investment 
this evaluation requires significant judgment regarding  but not limited to  the severity and duration of decline in market prices  the ability and intent to hold the securities until recovery  financial condition  liquidity  and near term prospects of the issuer  specific events  and other factors 
sprint assessment that an investment is not other than temporarily impaired could change in the future due to changes in facts and circumstances 
sprint owns a ownership interest in clearwire for which the carrying value as of december  was billion while the value of such investment based on clearwire closing stock price was billion 
sprint ability to recover the carrying value of its investment depends  in part  upon clearwire ability to obtain sufficient funding to support its operations and its ability to successfully develop  deploy  and maintain its g network 
a decline in the estimated fair value of clearwire that would be deemed to be other than temporary could result in a material impairment to the carrying value of our investment 
we do not intend to sell our economic interest in the foreseeable future  and recoverability of our equity investment is not affected by short term fluctuations in clearwire stock price 
accordingly  we expect to fully recover the carrying value of our investment in clearwire 
valuation and recoverability of long lived assets long lived assets consist primarily of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization 
changes in technology or in our intended use of these assets  as well as changes in economic or industry factors or in our business or prospects  may cause the estimated period of use or the value of these assets to change 
property  plant and equipment are generally depreciated on a straight line basis over estimated economic useful lives 
certain network assets are depreciated using the group life method 
depreciable life studies are performed periodically to confirm the appropriateness of depreciable lives for certain categories of property  plant and equipment 
these studies take into account actual usage  physical wear and tear  replacement history and assumptions about technology evolution 
when these factors indicate that an asset useful life is different from the previous assessment  we depreciate the remaining book values prospectively over the adjusted remaining estimated useful life 
depreciation rates for assets using the group life method are revised periodically as required under this method 
changes made as a result of depreciable life studies and rate changes generally do not have a material effect on depreciation expense 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
long lived asset groups were determined based upon certain factors including assessing the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities 
if the total of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of our assets  a loss is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of the assets 
impairment analyses  when 
table of contents performed  are based on our current business and technology strategy  views of growth rates for our business  anticipated future economic and regulatory conditions and expected technological availability 
during  we analyzed long lived assets in our wireless segment for recoverability and  based on our estimate of undiscounted cash flows  determined the carrying value to be recoverable 
our estimate of undiscounted cash flows exceeded the carrying value of these assets by more than 
if we continue to have operational challenges  including obtaining and retaining subscribers  future cash flows of the company may not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of our wireless asset group  and we could record asset impairments that are material to sprint consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
in addition to the analyses described above  certain assets that have not yet been deployed in the business  including network equipment  cell site development costs and software in development  are periodically assessed to determine recoverability 
network equipment and cell site development costs are expensed whenever events or changes in circumstances cause the company to conclude the assets are no longer needed to meet management strategic network plans and will not be deployed 
software development costs are expensed when it is no longer probable that the software project will be deployed 
network equipment that has been removed from the network is also periodically assessed to determine recoverability 
if we continue to have challenges retaining subscribers and as we continue to assess the impact of rebanding the iden network  management may conclude in future periods that certain cdma and iden assets will never be either deployed or redeployed  in which case non cash charges that could be material to our consolidated financial statements would be recognized 
evaluation of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment goodwill represents the excess of purchase price paid over the fair value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses 
sprint evaluates the carrying value of goodwill annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed estimated fair value 
our analysis includes a comparison of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to which goodwill applies to the carrying value  including goodwill  of that reporting unit 
we regularly assess whether any indicators of impairment exist  which requires a significant amount of judgment 
such indicators may include a sustained significant decline in our share price and market capitalization  a decline in our expected future cash flows  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  unanticipated competition  the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit  and or slower growth rates  among others 
any adverse change in these factors could result in an impairment that could be material to our consolidated financial statements 
the determination of the estimated fair value of the wireless reporting unit requires significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions primarily include  but are not limited to  transactions within the wireless industry and related control premiums  discount rate  terminal growth rates  operating income before depreciation and amortization oibda and capital expenditures forecasts 
due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making those estimates  actual results could differ from those estimates 
the merits of each significant assumption  both individually and in the aggregate  used to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit are evaluated for reasonableness 
fcc licenses and our sprint and boost mobile trademarks have been identified as indefinite lived intangible assets  in addition to goodwill  after considering the expected use of the assets  the regulatory and economic environment within which they are being used  and the effects of obsolescence on their use 
when required  sprint assesses the recoverability of other indefinite lived intangibles  including fcc licenses which are carried as a single unit of accounting 
in assessing recoverability of fcc licenses  we estimate the fair value of such licenses using the greenfield direct value method  which approximates value through estimating the discounted future cash flows of a hypothetical start up business 
assumptions key in estimating fair value under this method include  but are not limited to  capital expenditures  subscriber activations and deactivations  market share achieved  tax rates in effect and discount rate 
a one percent decline in our assumed revenue growth rate used to estimate terminal value  a one percent decline in our assumed net cash flows or a one percent adverse change in any of the key assumptions referred to above would not result in an impairment of our fcc licenses as of the most recent testing date 
a decline in the estimated fair value of fcc licenses of approximately also would not result in an impairment of the carrying value 
accruals for taxes based on income uncertainties exist with respect to interpretation of complex us federal and state tax regulations 
management expects that sprint interpretations will prevail 
also  sprint has recognized deferred tax benefits relating to its future utilization of past operating losses 
sprint believes it is more likely than not that the amounts of deferred tax assets in excess of the related valuation allowances will be realized 
the accounting estimates related to the tax valuation allowance require us to make assumptions regarding the timing of future events  including the probability of expected future taxable income and available tax planning opportunities 
these assumptions require significant judgment because actual performance has fluctuated in the past and may do so in the future 
the impact that changes in actual performance versus these estimates could have on the realization of tax benefits as reported in our results of operations could be material 
the accounting estimates related to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits require us to make judgments 
table of contents regarding the sustainability of each uncertain tax position based on its technical merits 
these estimates are updated based on the facts  circumstances and information available 
we are also required to assess at each annual reporting date whether it is reasonably possible that any significant increases or decreases to the unrecognized tax benefits will occur during the next twelve months 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued authoritative literature regarding amendments to fasb interpretation no 
r  which changes various aspects of accounting for and disclosures of interests in variable interest entities  and accounting for transfers of financial assets  which was issued in order to improve the relevance  representational faithfulness  and comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial statements about a transfer of financial assets  the effects of a transfer on its financial position  financial performance  and cash flows  and a transferor continuing involvement  if any  in transferred financial assets 
this guidance was effective beginning in january and did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb modified the accounting for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements and certain revenue arrangements that include software elements 
these modifications alter the methods previously required for allocating consideration received in multiple element arrangements to require revenue allocation based on a relative selling price method  including arrangements containing software components and non software components that function together to deliver the product essential functionality 
these modifications will be effective prospectively for the fiscal year ending december  and are not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued authoritative guidance regarding improving disclosures about fair value measurements  which requires new and amended disclosure requirements for classes of assets and liabilities  inputs and valuation techniques and transfers between levels of fair value measurements and accounting for distributions to shareholders with components of stock and cash  which clarifies the accounting for distributions to shareholders that offer them the ability to elect to receive their entire distribution in cash or shares of equivalent value 
this guidance was effective beginning in january and did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb amended the requirements for disclosures about the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses 
as a result of these amendments  an entity is required to disaggregate by portfolio segment or class certain existing disclosures and provide certain new disclosures about its financing receivables and related allowance for credit losses 
the new disclosures as of the end of the reporting period are effective for the fiscal year ending december   while the disclosures about activity that occurs during a reporting period are effective for the first fiscal quarter of the disclosure requirements effective for the fiscal year ending december  did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
the requirements effective for the first fiscal quarter of are not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
forward looking statements we include certain estimates  projections and other forward looking statements in our annual  quarterly and current reports  and in other publicly available material 
statements regarding expectations  including performance assumptions and estimates relating to capital requirements  as well as other statements that are not historical facts  are forward looking statements 
these statements reflect management judgments based on currently available information and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements

financial strategies general risk management policies our board of directors has adopted a financial risk management policy that authorizes us to enter into derivative transactions  and all transactions comply with the policy 
we do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes with the exception of equity rights obtained in connection with commercial agreements or strategic investments  usually in the form of warrants to purchase common shares 
derivative instruments are primarily used for hedging and risk management purposes 
hedging activities may be done for various purposes  including  but not limited to  mitigating the risks associated with an asset  liability  committed transaction or probable forecasted transaction 
we seek to minimize counterparty credit risk through stringent credit approval and review processes  credit support agreements  continual review and monitoring of all counterparties  and thorough legal review of contracts 
exposure to market risk is controlled by regularly monitoring changes in hedge positions under normal and stress conditions to ensure they do not exceed established limits 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are primarily exposed to the market risk associated with unfavorable movements in interest rates  foreign 
table of contents currencies  and equity prices 
the risk inherent in our market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in those factors 
interest rate risk the communications industry is a capital intensive  technology driven business 
we are subject to interest rate risk primarily associated with our borrowings 
interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates could adversely affect earnings and cash flows 
specific interest rate risk includes the risk of increasing interest rates on floating rate debt and the risk of increasing interest rates for planned new fixed rate long term financings or refinancings 
about of our debt as of december  was fixed rate debt 
while changes in interest rates impact the fair value of this debt  there is no impact to earnings and cash flows because we intend to hold these obligations to maturity unless market and other conditions are favorable 
we perform interest rate sensitivity analyses on our variable rate debt 
these analyses indicate that a one percentage point change in interest rates would have an annual pre tax impact of million on our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows for the year ended december  we also perform a sensitivity analysis on the fair market value of our outstanding debt 
a decline in market interest rates would cause a million increase in the fair market value of our debt to billion 
foreign currency risk we also enter into forward contracts and options in foreign currencies to reduce the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates 
our foreign exchange risk management program focuses on reducing transaction exposure to optimize consolidated cash flow 
we use foreign currency derivatives to hedge our foreign currency exposure related to settlement of international telecommunications access charges and the operation of our international subsidiaries 
the dollar equivalent of our net foreign currency payables from international settlements was million and the net foreign currency receivables from international operations were million as of december  the potential immediate pre tax loss to us that would result from a hypothetical change in foreign currency exchange rates based on these positions would be insignificant 
equity risk we are exposed to market risk as it relates to changes in the market value of our investments 
we invest in equity instruments of public companies for operational and strategic business purposes 
these securities are subject to significant fluctuations in fair market value due to volatility of the stock market and industries in which the companies operate 
these securities  which are classified in investments on the consolidated balance sheets  primarily include equity method investments  such as our investment in clearwire and available for sale securities 
in certain business transactions  we are granted warrants to purchase the securities of other companies at fixed rates 
these warrants are supplemental to the terms of the business transaction and are not designated as hedging instruments
