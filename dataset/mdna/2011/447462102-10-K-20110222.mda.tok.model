item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in this annual report on form k 
discussions about the important operational risks that our business encounters can be found in part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
on august   we restated our financial statements for the years ended  and and the first quarter of thereafter  the sec commenced an investigation into the facts and circumstances of the restatement  the united states attorney s office for the northern district of illinois usao requested certain documents related to the restatement and plaintiffs brought a purported private shareholder class action litigation and derivative litigation with respect to the restatement the restatement matters 
the restatement matters  together with the reputational issues raised by the restatement  could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  cash flow  overall liquidity  results of operations or financial condition 
we restated certain of our previously issued financial statements to correct our accounting for certain acquisition related payments received by the selling shareholders of specific businesses we acquired that were subsequently redistributed by the selling shareholders among themselves and to other select company employees 
the restatement and the restatement matters have raised reputational issues for our businesses and may adversely impact our ability to retain our senior management team  our practice leaders and our other managing directors  hire and retain talented people in an industry where there is great competition for talent  maintain our existing business practices and revenues given our clients ability to terminate their engagement agreements with little or no notice and without penalty  attract new business in the highly competitive consulting services industry  and continue our growth strategy by hiring individuals or groups of individuals and by acquiring complementary businesses 
the sec is conducting an investigation with respect to the restatement 
in addition  as often happens in these circumstances  shortly after the filing of our restated financial statements  the usao contacted our counsel and made a telephonic request for copies of certain documents that we previously provided to the sec 
further  several purported private shareholder class action lawsuits  since consolidated  and derivative lawsuits have been filed in respect of the restatement 
on december   we reached an agreement in principle with the lead plaintiffs to settle the purported class action lawsuit the class action settlement  pursuant to which the plaintiffs will receive total consideration of approximately million  comprised of million in cash and the issuance by the company of  shares of our common stock settlement shares 
the settlement shares had an aggregate value of approximately million based on the closing market price of our common stock on december  as a result of the class action settlement  we recorded a non cash charge to earnings in the fourth quarter of of million representing the fair value of the settlement shares and a corresponding settlement liability 
we will adjust the amount of the non cash charge and corresponding settlement liability to reflect changes in the fair value of the settlement shares until and including the date of issuance  which may result in either additional non cash charges or non cash gains 
as of december   in accordance with the proposed settlement  we also recorded a receivable for the cash portion of the consideration  which was funded into escrow in its entirety by our insurance carriers  and a corresponding settlement liability 
there was no impact to our consolidated statement of operations for the cash consideration as we concluded that a right of setoff existed in accordance with accounting standards codification topic  other presentation matters 
the total amount of insurance coverage under the related policy was million and the insurers had previously paid out approximately million in claims prior to the final million payment discussed above 
as a result of the final payment by the insurance carriers  we will not receive any further contributions from our insurance carriers for the reimbursement of legal fees expended on the finalization 
table of contents of the class action settlement or any amounts including any damages  settlement costs or legal fees with respect to the remaining restatement matters 
the proposed class action settlement received preliminary court approval on january  and is subject to final court approval  and the issuance of the settlement shares 
a fairness hearing is currently scheduled to consider the final approval of the settlement on may  the issuance of the settlement shares is expected to occur after final court approval is granted 
there can be no assurance that final court approval will be granted 
additionally  the company has the right to terminate the settlement if class members representing more than a specified amount of alleged securities losses elect to opt out of the settlement 
while we are fully cooperating with the sec in its investigations with respect to the restatement  have voluntarily provided to the usao the requested documents  and intend to vigorously defend the restatement lawsuits  the restatement matters subject us to a number of additional risks  including the diversion of management s time  attention and resources from managing and marketing our company  increased costs and expenses to address the restatement matters and the imposition of fines  penalties  damages  administrative remedies and liabilities for additional amounts resulting from actions or findings by the sec or the usao or pursuant to rulings  orders or judgments by the courts with jurisdiction over the restatement lawsuits  none of which will be covered by our insurance carriers if the class action settlement becomes final  and additional damage to our reputation as these matters are concluded that may further heighten the risks described above 
given the uncertain nature of the restatement matters and the uncertainties related to the incurrence and amount of loss  including with respect to the imposition of fines  penalties  damages  administrative remedies and liabilities for additional amounts  with respect to the restatement matters  we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of the restatement matters  determine whether any additional liability other than those described above has been incurred or make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome in the restatement matters 
any such additional liability could be material 
the failure to successfully address any one or more of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  cash flow  overall liquidity  results of operations or financial condition 
an inability to retain our senior management team and other managing directors would be detrimental to the success of our business 
we rely heavily on our senior management team  our practice leaders  and other managing directors  and our ability to retain them is particularly important to our future success 
given the highly specialized nature of our services  the senior management team must have a thorough understanding of our service offerings as well as the skills and experience necessary to manage an organization consisting of a diverse group of professionals 
in addition  we rely on our senior management team and other managing directors to generate and market our business 
further  our senior management s and other managing directors personal reputations and relationships with our clients are a critical element in obtaining and maintaining client engagements 
although we enter into non solicitation agreements with our senior management team and other managing directors  we generally do not enter into non competition agreements 
accordingly  members of our senior management team and our other managing directors are not contractually prohibited from leaving or joining one of our competitors  and some of our clients could choose to use the services of that competitor instead of our services 
if one or more members of our senior management team or our other managing directors leave and we cannot replace them with a suitable candidate quickly  we could experience difficulty in securing and successfully completing engagements and managing our business properly  which could harm our business prospects and results of operations 

table of contents our inability to hire and retain talented people in an industry where there is great competition for talent could have a serious negative effect on our prospects and results of operations 
our business involves the delivery of professional services and is highly labor intensive 
our success depends largely on our general ability to attract  develop  motivate and retain highly skilled professionals 
further  we must successfully maintain the right mix of professionals with relevant experience and skill sets as we continue to grow  as we expand into new service offerings  and as the market evolves 
the loss of a significant number of our professionals  the inability to attract  hire  develop  train and retain additional skilled personnel  or not maintaining the right mix of professionals could have a serious negative effect on us  including our ability to manage  staff and successfully complete our existing engagements and obtain new engagements 
qualified professionals are in great demand  and we face significant competition for both senior and junior professionals with the requisite credentials and experience 
our principal competition for talent comes from other consulting firms  accounting firms and technical and economic advisory firms  as well as from organizations seeking to staff their internal professional positions 
many of these competitors may be able to offer significantly greater compensation and benefits or more attractive lifestyle choices  career paths or geographic locations than we do 
therefore  we may not be successful in attracting and retaining the skilled consultants we require to conduct and expand our operations successfully 
increasing competition for these revenue generating professionals may also significantly increase our labor costs  which could negatively affect our margins and results of operations 
additional hiring  departures  business acquisitions and dispositions could disrupt our operations  increase our costs or otherwise harm our business 
our business strategy is dependent in part upon our ability to grow by hiring individuals or groups of individuals and by acquiring complementary businesses 
however  we may be unable to identify  hire  acquire or successfully integrate new employees and acquired businesses without substantial expense  delay or other operational or financial obstacles 
from time to time  we will evaluate the total mix of services we provide and we may conclude that businesses may not achieve the promise we previously expected 
for example  effective december   we disposed of our strategy business  in the second quarter of we wound down our japan operations  and in the third quarter of we exited the disputes and investigations practice and utilities consulting practice 
competition for future hiring and acquisition opportunities in our markets could increase the compensation we offer to potential employees or the prices we pay for businesses we wish to acquire 
in addition  we may be unable to achieve the financial  operational and other benefits we anticipate from any hiring or acquisition  as well as any disposition  including those we have completed so far 
new acquisitions could also negatively impact existing practices and cause current employees to depart 
hiring additional employees or acquiring businesses could also involve a number of additional risks  including the diversion of management s time  attention and resources from managing and marketing our company  the failure to retain key acquired personnel or existing personnel who may view the acquisition unfavorably  potential impairment of existing relationships with our clients  such as client satisfaction or performance problems  whether as a result of integration or management difficulties or otherwise  the need to compensate new employees while they wait for their restrictive covenants with other institutions to expire  the creation of conflicts of interest that require us to decline or resign from engagements that we otherwise could have accepted  the potential need to raise significant amounts of capital to finance a transaction or the potential issuance of equity securities that could be dilutive to our existing stockholders  increased costs to improve  coordinate or integrate managerial  operational  financial and administrative systems  the usage of earn outs based on the future performance of our business acquisitions may deter the acquired company from fully integrating into our existing business  
table of contents a decision not to fully integrate an acquired business may lead to the perception of inequalities if different groups of employees are eligible for different benefits and incentives or are subject to different policies and programs  difficulties in integrating diverse backgrounds and experiences of consultants  including if we experience a transition period for newly hired consultants that results in a temporary drop in our utilization rates or margins  and the adverse short term effects on reported operating results from the amortization or write off of acquired goodwill and other intangible assets 
moreover  selling practices and shutting down operations present similar challenges in a service business 
divestitures not only require management s time  but they can impair existing relationships with clients or otherwise affect client satisfaction  particularly in situations where the divestiture eliminates only part of the compliment of consulting services provided to a client 
if we fail to successfully address these risks  our ability to compete may be impaired 
if we are unable to manage fluctuations in our business successfully  we may not be able to sustain profitability 
we have grown significantly since we commenced operations  increasing the number of our full time professionals from as of may  to  as of december  additionally  our considerable growth and the circumstances of the restatement has placed demands on our management and our internal systems  procedures and controls and will continue to do so in the near future 
to successfully manage growth and respond to the events described above  we must periodically adjust and strengthen our operating  financial  accounting and other systems  procedures and controls  which could increase our costs and may adversely affect our gross profits and our ability to sustain profitability if we do not generate increased revenues to offset the costs 
as a public company  our information and control systems must enable us to prepare accurate and timely financial information and other required disclosures 
if we discover deficiencies in our existing information and control systems that impede our ability to satisfy our reporting requirements  we must successfully implement improvements to those systems in an efficient and timely manner 
our business is becoming increasingly dependent on information technology and will require additional investments in order to grow and implement redundancies necessary to prevent service interruption 
we depend on the use of sophisticated technologies and systems 
some of our practices provide services that are increasingly dependent on the use of software applications and systems that we do not own and could become unavailable 
moreover  our technology platforms will require continuing investments by us  in order to expand existing service offerings and develop complimentary services 
a portion of our business  in which we utilize third party software technology  has grown over the last few years and now represents a substantial portion of our total revenues 
one of our service lines has made and expects to continue to make investments in technology driven businesses that compliment its service offerings 
our future success depends on our ability to adapt our services and infrastructure while continuing to improve the performance  features and reliability of our services in response to the evolving demands of the marketplace 
additionally  our organization is comprised of employees who work on matters throughout the united states and overseas 
our technology platform is a virtual office from which we all operate 
we may be subject to disruption to our operating systems from technology events that our beyond our control  which may produce service interruptions that in turn result in loss or liability to us 
the company will need to continue to invest in technology in order to meet the developing demands of our clients and achieve redundancies necessary to prevent service interruptions 
our reputation could be damaged and we could incur additional liabilities if we fail to protect client and employee data through our own accord or if our information systems are breached 
we rely on information technology systems to process  transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our clients  partners  and employees 
the breadth and complexity of this infrastructure increases the potential risk of security breaches which could lead to potential unauthorized disclosure of confidential information 

table of contents in providing services to clients  we may manage  utilize and store sensitive or confidential client or employee data  including personal data 
as a result  we are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect this information  such as the us federal and state laws governing the protection of health or other personally identifiable information and international laws such the european union directive on data protection 
these laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number 
if any person  including any of our employees  negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to client or employee data  or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data  we could be subject to significant monetary damages  regulatory enforcement actions  fines  and or criminal prosecution 
unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or employee data  whether through systems failure  employee negligence  fraud or misappropriation  could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients 
our international expansion could result in additional risks 
we operate both domestically and internationally  including in the middle east  europe and asia 
although historically our international operations have been limited  we intend to continue to expand internationally 
such expansion may result in additional risks that are not present domestically and which could adversely affect our business or our results of operations  including compliance with additional us regulations and those of other nations applicable to international operations  cultural and language differences  employment laws and rules and related social and cultural factors  currency fluctuations between the us dollar and foreign currencies  which is harder to predict in the current adverse global economic climate  restrictions on the repatriation of earnings  potentially adverse tax consequences  different regulatory requirements and other barriers to conducting business  different or less stable political and economic environments  greater personal security risks for employees traveling to unstable locations  and civil disturbances or other catastrophic events 
further  conducting business abroad subjects us to increased regulatory compliance and oversight  in particular with respect to operations in the middle east 
a failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in substantial penalties assessed against the company and our employees 
political turmoil could affect the physical security of our employees working in a troubled country 

table of contents our obligations under the credit agreement are secured by a pledge of certain of the equity interests in our subsidiaries and a lien on substantially all of our assets and those of our subsidiary grantors 
if we default on these obligations  our lenders may foreclose on our assets  including our pledged equity interest in our subsidiaries 
on september   we entered into the security agreement in connection with our entry into the eighth amendment to the revolving credit and term loan credit agreement the credit agreement 
pursuant to the security agreement and to secure our obligations under the credit agreement  we granted our lenders a first priority lien  subject to permitted liens  on substantially all of the personal property assets that we and the subsidiary grantors own 
this first priority lien is in addition to the existing pledge the equity pledge that we previously granted to our lenders of of the voting stock or other equity interests in our domestic subsidiaries and of the voting stock or other equity interests in our foreign subsidiaries 
if we default on our obligations under the credit agreement  our lenders could accelerate our indebtedness and may be able to exercise their liens on the equity interests subject to the equity pledge and on their liens on substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiary grantors  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  operations  financial condition and liquidity 
our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations and obligations  expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt  and could adversely affect our financial results 
at december   we had outstanding borrowings totaling million compared to million at december  our substantial indebtedness could have meaningful consequences for us  including exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates because our borrowings are at variable interest rates  requiring us to dedicate a larger portion of our cash from operations to service our indebtedness and thus reducing the level of cash for other purposes such as funding working capital  strategic acquisitions  capital expenditures  and other general corporate purposes  and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing 
our intellectual property rights in our huron consulting group name are important  and any inability to use that name could negatively impact our ability to build brand identity 
we believe that establishing  maintaining and enhancing the huron consulting group name is important to our business 
we are  however  aware of a number of other companies that use names containing huron 
there could be potential trade name or service mark infringement claims brought against us by the users of these similar names and marks and those users may have trade name or service mark rights that are senior to ours 
if another company were to successfully challenge our right to use our name  or if we were unable to prevent a competitor from using a name that is similar to our name  our ability to build brand identity could be negatively impacted 
our financial results could suffer if we are unable to achieve or maintain adequate utilization and suitable billing rates for our consultants 
our profitability depends to a large extent on the utilization and billing rates of our professionals 
utilization of our professionals is affected by a number of factors  including the number and size of client engagements  the timing of the commencement  completion and termination of engagements  which in many cases is unpredictable  our ability to transition our consultants efficiently from completed engagements to new engagements  
table of contents the hiring of additional consultants because there is generally a transition period for new consultants that results in a temporary drop in our utilization rate  unanticipated changes in the scope of client engagements  our ability to forecast demand for our services and thereby maintain an appropriate level of consultants  and conditions affecting the industries in which we practice as well as general economic conditions 
the billing rates of our consultants that we are able to charge are also affected by a number of factors  including our clients perception of our ability to add value through our services  the market demand for the services we provide  an increase in the number of clients in the government sector  introduction of new services by us or our competitors  our competition and the pricing policies of our competitors  and current economic conditions 
if we are unable to achieve and maintain adequate overall utilization as well as maintain or increase the billing rates for our consultants  our financial results could materially suffer 
expanding our service offerings or number of offices may not be profitable 
we may choose to develop new service offerings  open new offices or eliminate service offerings because of market opportunities or client demands 
developing new service offerings involves inherent risks  including our inability to estimate demand for the new service offerings  competition from more established market participants  a lack of market understanding  and unanticipated expenses to recruit and hire qualified consultants and to market our new service offerings 
in addition  expanding into new geographic areas and expanding current service offerings is challenging and may require integrating new employees into our culture as well as assessing the demand in the applicable market 
if we cannot manage the risks associated with new service offerings or new locations effectively  we are unlikely to be successful in these efforts  which could harm our ability to sustain profitability and our business prospects 
our ability to maintain and attract new business depends upon our reputation  the professional reputation of our revenue generating employees and the quality of our services 
as a professional services firm  our ability to secure new engagements depends heavily upon our reputation and the individual reputations of our professionals 
any factor that diminishes our reputation or that of our employees  including not meeting client expectations or misconduct by our employees  could make it substantially more difficult for us to attract new engagements and clients 
similarly  because we obtain many of our new engagements from former or current clients or from referrals by those clients or by law firms that we have worked with in the past  any client that questions the quality of our work or that of our consultants could impair our ability to secure additional new engagements and clients 

table of contents the profitability of our fixed fee engagements with clients may not meet our expectations if we underestimate the cost of these engagements 
when making proposals for fixed fee engagements  we estimate the costs and timing for completing the engagements 
these estimates reflect our best judgment regarding the efficiencies of our methodologies and consultants as we plan to deploy them on engagements 
any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in connection with the performance of fixed fee engagements  including delays caused by factors outside our control  could make these contracts less profitable or unprofitable  which would have an adverse effect on our profit margin 
for the years ended december     fixed fee engagements represented  and  respectively  of our revenues 
revenues from our performance based engagements are difficult to predict  and the timing and extent of recovery of our costs is uncertain 
we have engagement agreements under which our fees include a significant performance based component 
performance based fees are contingent on the achievement of specific measures  such as our clients meeting cost saving or other contractually defined goals 
the achievement of these contractually defined goals is subject to acknowledgement by the client and is often impacted by factors outside of our control  such as the actions of the client or other third parties 
because performance based fees are contingent  revenues on such engagements  which are recognized when all revenue recognition criteria are met  are not certain and the timing of receipt is difficult to predict and may not occur evenly throughout the year 
as expected  due to stockamp associates  inc  a consulting firm that we acquired in the third quarter of and which has a large number of performance based fee engagements  the percentage of performance based fee engagements has increased  increasing the percentage of our revenues derived from performance based fees to for the year ended december  and for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  a greater number of performance based fee arrangements may result in increased volatility in our working capital requirements and greater variations in our quarter to quarter results  which could affect the price of our common stock 
in addition  an increase in the proportion of performance based fee arrangements may temporarily offset the positive effect on our operating results from an increase in our utilization rate until the related revenues are recognized 
a significant portion of our revenues is derived from a limited number of clients  and our engagement agreements  including those related to our largest clients  can be terminated by our clients with little or no notice and without penalty  which may cause our operating results to be unpredictable 
as a consulting firm  we have derived  and expect to continue to derive  a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of clients 
our ten largest clients accounted for approximately  and of our revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
no single client accounted for more than of our revenues in  or our clients typically retain us on an engagement by engagement basis  rather than under fixed term contracts  the volume of work performed for any particular client is likely to vary from year to year and a major client in one fiscal period may not require or decide not to use our services in any subsequent fiscal period 
moreover  a large portion of our new engagements comes from existing clients 
accordingly  the failure to obtain new large engagements or multiple engagements from existing or new clients could have a material adverse effect on the amount of revenues we generate 
in addition  almost all of our engagement agreements can be terminated by our clients with little or no notice and without penalty 
for example  in engagements related to litigation  if the litigation were to be settled  our engagement for those services would no longer be necessary and  therefore  would be terminated 
in client engagements that involve multiple engagements or stages  there is a risk that a client may choose not to retain us for additional stages of an engagement or that a client will cancel or delay additional planned engagements 
for clients in bankruptcy  a bankruptcy court could elect not to retain our interim management consultants  terminate our retention  require us to reduce our fees for the duration of an engagement  or approve claims against fees earned by us prior to or after the bankruptcy filing 
terminations of engagements  cancellations of portions of the project plan  delays in the work schedule or reductions in fees could result from factors unrelated to our services 
when engagements are terminated or reduced  we lose the associated future revenues  and we may not be able to recover associated costs or redeploy the affected employees in a timely manner to 
table of contents minimize the negative impact 
in addition  our clients ability to terminate engagements with little or no notice and without penalty makes it difficult to predict our operating results in any particular fiscal period 
our engagements could result in professional liability  which could be very costly and hurt our reputation 
our engagements typically involve complex analyses and the exercise of professional judgment 
as a result  we are subject to the risk of professional liability 
if a client questions the quality of our work  the client could threaten or bring a lawsuit to recover damages or contest its obligation to pay our fees 
litigation alleging that we performed negligently or breached any other obligations to a client could expose us to significant legal liabilities and  regardless of outcome  is often very costly  could distract our management and could damage our reputation 
we are not always able to include provisions in our engagement agreements that are designed to limit our exposure to legal claims relating to our services 
even if these limiting provisions are included in an engagement agreement  they may not protect us or may not be enforceable under some circumstances 
in addition  we carry professional liability insurance to cover many of these types of claims  but the policy limits and the breadth of coverage may be inadequate to cover any particular claim or all claims plus the cost of legal defense 
for example  we provide services on engagements in which the impact on a client may substantially exceed the limits of our errors and omissions insurance coverage 
if we are found to have professional liability with respect to work performed on such an engagement  we may not have sufficient insurance to cover the entire liability 
the consulting services industry is highly competitive  and we may not be able to compete effectively 
the consulting services industry in which we operate includes a large number of participants and is intensely competitive 
we face competition from other business operations and financial consulting firms  general management consulting firms  the consulting practices of major accounting firms  technical and economic advisory firms  regional and specialty consulting firms and the internal professional resources of organizations 
in addition  because there are relatively low barriers to entry  we expect to continue to face additional competition from new entrants into the business operations and financial consulting industries 
many of our competitors have a greater national and international presence  as well as have significantly greater personnel  financial  technical and marketing resources 
in addition  these competitors may generate greater revenues and have greater name recognition than we do 
our ability to compete also depends in part on the ability of our competitors to hire  retain and motivate skilled professionals  the price at which others offer comparable services and our competitors responsiveness to their clients 
if we are unable to compete successfully with our existing competitors or with any new competitors  our financial results will be adversely affected 
conflicts of interest could preclude us from accepting engagements thereby causing decreased utilization and revenues 
we provide services in connection with bankruptcy  litigation and other proceedings proceedings that usually involve sensitive client information and frequently are adversarial 
in connection with bankruptcy proceedings  we are required by law to be disinterested and may not be able to provide multiple services to a particular client 
in litigation we would generally be prohibited from performing services in the same litigation for the party adverse to our client 
in addition  our engagement agreement with a client or other business reasons may preclude us from accepting engagements from time to time with our clients competitors or adversaries 
as we adjust the size of our operations and the complement of consulting services  the number of conflict situations will continue to increase 
moreover  in many industries in which we provide services  there has been a continuing trend toward business consolidations and strategic alliances 
these consolidations and alliances reduce the number of companies that may seek our services and increase the chances that we will be unable to accept new engagements as a result of conflicts of interest 
if we are unable to accept new engagements for any reason  our consultants may become underutilized  which would adversely affect our revenues and results of operations in future periods 
the nature of our services and the current economic environment make evaluating our business difficult 
although we have consistently generated positive earnings since we became a public company  except for the year ended december  as a result of the non cash goodwill impairment charge  we may not sustain profitability in the 
table of contents future 
additionally  the current instability in the global economy makes it even harder to predict our future operating results 
to sustain profitability  we must attract  integrate  retain and motivate highly qualified professionals  achieve and maintain adequate utilization and suitable billing rates for our revenue generating professionals  expand our existing relationships with our clients and identify new clients in need of our services  successfully re sell engagements and secure new engagements every year  which may prove to be difficult in light of the current adverse economic conditions  maintain and enhance our brand recognition  and adapt quickly to meet changes in our markets  our business mix  the economic environment  the credit markets  and competitive developments

based on our internal inquiry  which is complete  we have concluded that an adjustment to our historical financial statements is not required with respect to this matter
