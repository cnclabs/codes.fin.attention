item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary we operate in three primary business segments manufacturing  wheel services  refurbishment parts  and leasing services 
these three business segments are operationally integrated 
the manufacturing segment  operating from facilities in the united states us  mexico and poland  produces double stack intermodal railcars  conventional railcars  tank cars and marine vessels 
the wheel services  refurbishment parts segment performs railcar repair  refurbishment and maintenance activities in the us  mexico and canada as well as wheel  axle and bearing servicing  and production and reconditioning of a variety of parts for the railroad industry 
the leasing services segment owns approximately  railcars and provides management services for approximately  railcars for railroads  shippers  carriers  institutional investors and other leasing and transportation companies in north america 
management evaluates segment performance based on margins 
we also produce rail castings through an unconsolidated joint venture 
the rail and marine industries are cyclical in nature 
we are continuing to see recovery in the freight car markets in which we operate 
demand for our marine barge products remains soft 
customer orders may be subject to cancellations and contain terms and conditions customary in the industry 
historically  little variation has been experienced between the quantity ordered and the quantity actually delivered 
our railcar and marine backlogs are not necessarily indicative of future results of operations 
multi year supply agreements are a part of rail industry practice 
our total manufacturing backlog of railcars as of august  was approximately  units with an estimated value of billion compared to  units with an estimated value of million as of august  based on current production plans  approximately  units in the august  backlog are scheduled for delivery in the balance of the production is scheduled for delivery through a portion of the orders included in backlog reflects an assumed product mix 
under terms of the orders  the exact mix will be determined in the future which may impact the dollar amount of backlog 
we currently have no marine backlog compared to approximately million as of august  as a result of current softness in the marine market  we continue to shift marine workers to support new railcar production 
the recent global strengthening of freight car markets may at times limit the availability of certain components of our products that we source from external suppliers  particularly specialized components such as castings  bolsters and trucks  and this may cause an interruption in production 
prices for steel  a primary component of railcars and barges  and related surcharges have fluctuated significantly and remain volatile 
in addition  the price of certain railcar components  which are a product of steel  are affected by steel price fluctuations 
new railcar and marine backlog generally either includes fixed price contracts which anticipate material price increases and surcharges  or contracts that contain actual or formulaic pass through of material price increases and surcharges 
we are aggressively working to mitigate these exposures 
the company s integrated business model has helped offset some of the effects of fluctuating steel and scrap steel prices  as a portion of our business segments benefit from rising steel scrap prices while other segments benefit from lower steel and scrap steel prices through enhanced margins 
on june   we entered into a five year million revolving line of credit  maturing june  on november  the revolving line of credit was increased by million to a total of million under the existing provisions of the credit agreement 
the amended credit facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of greenbrier and its material us subsidiaries  excluding the stock and assets of certain foreign subsidiaries and assets pledged as security for existing term loans 
this new facility replaces a million revolving line of credit that would have matured in november in connection with the entry into this facility  on june  we repaid all obligations outstanding under the term loan due june  among us  and affiliates of wl ross co 
llc the wlr term loan 
immediately prior to its repayment and termination  there were outstanding borrowings of million under the wlr term loan 
there was a one time charge recorded in loss on extinguishment of debt in association with the early repayment of the wlr the greenbrier companies annual report 
table of contents term loan of million for the write off of unamortized debt acquisition costs and the debt discount 
the line of credit is available to provide working capital and interim financing of equipment  principally for the us and mexican operations 
advances under this revolving credit facility bear interest at variable rates that depend on the type of borrowing and the defined ratio of debt to total capitalization 
the new facility contains customary representations  warranties  and covenants  including specified restrictions on indebtedness  dispositions  restricted payments  transactions with affiliates  liens  fundamental changes  sale and leaseback transactions and other restrictions 
on march   we entered into a purchase agreement the purchase agreement with merrill lynch  pierce  fenner smith  incorporated and goldman  sachs co 
the initial purchasers 
pursuant to the purchase agreement  we sold to the initial purchasers million aggregate principal amount of our senior convertible notes due the convertible notes  which included million principal amount of convertible notes subject to the over allotment option granted to the initial purchasers 
the over allotment option was exercised in full and the sale of million aggregate principal amount of the convertible notes closed on april  in connection with the closing  on april   we entered into the indenture the convertible notes indenture governing the convertible notes 
the convertible notes indenture contains terms  conditions and events of default customary for transactions of this nature 
the convertible notes bear interest at an annual rate of  payable in cash semiannually in arrears on april and october of each year  beginning on october  the convertible notes will mature on april   unless earlier repurchased by us or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date 
the convertible notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with our other senior unsecured debt 
the convertible notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of the convertible notes  which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share 
the initial conversion rate and conversion price are subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events  such as distributions  dividends or stock splits 
the net proceeds from the sale of the convertible notes  together with additional cash on hand  were used to repurchase any and all of our outstanding million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due the notes 
there was a one time charge recorded in loss on extinguishment of debt in association with the early retirement of the notes of million for the write off of unamortized debt acquisition costs  prepayment premiums and other costs 
in april  we filed a registration statement on form s with the sec  using a shelf registration process 
the registration statement was declared effective on april  and pursuant to the prospectus filed as part of the registration statement  we may sell from time to time any combination of securities in one or more offerings up to an aggregate amount of million 
the securities described in the prospectus include common stock  preferred stock  debt securities  guarantees  rights  and units 
we may also offer common stock or preferred stock upon conversion of debt securities  common stock upon conversion of preferred stock  or common stock  preferred stock or debt securities upon the exercise of warrants or rights 
each time we sell securities under the shelf  we will provide a prospectus supplement that will contain specific information about the terms of the securities being offered and of the offering 
proceeds from the sale of these securities may be used for general corporate purposes including  among other things  working capital  financings  possible acquisitions  the repayment of obligations that have matured  and reducing or refinancing indebtedness that may be outstanding at the time of any offering 
in may  we issued  shares of our common stock resulting in net proceeds of million 
in december  we issued  shares of our common stock resulting in net proceeds of million 
in december  we agreed with our joint venture partner to modify  with retroactive effect to september   various agreements concerning the greenbrier gimsa llc gimsa joint venture 
we agreed to increase revenue based fees to each of the partners for services provided to gimsa  and to extend the initial term of the joint venture to after which the agreement is automatically renewed for successive three year terms unless a party elects not to renew 
we also agreed to forego our option to increase our ownership percentage of gimsa from fifty percent to sixty six two thirds percent  and gimsa agreed to forego the right to share  in an equitable manner  the net benefits received from the modification of the long term new railcar contract with general electric railcar services corporation

margin was reduced by an million obligation of guaranteed minimum earnings under a certain contract 
wheel services  refurbishment parts segment wheel services  refurbishment parts revenue was million  million and million for the years ended august   and the million increase in revenue from to was primarily the result of higher sales volumes in wheels and repair and metal scrapping programs that were in effect for only a portion of the prior comparable year 
the million decrease in revenue from to was primarily due to lower sales volumes of wheels and reduced volumes of railcar repair and refurbishment work 
this was offset slightly by improvement in the price for scrap metal 
wheel services  refurbishment parts margin as a percentage of revenue was for  for and for the decrease in the current period was primarily the result of a change in product mix which generates higher revenues with no corresponding increase in margin dollars  an increasingly competitive market place and higher freight costs 
these decreases were partially offset by higher scrap metal prices  improved efficiencies for repair due to higher activity levels and metal scrapping programs that were in effect for only a portion of the prior year 
the decrease in compared to margins was primarily due to less favorable mix of repair and refurbishment work partially offset by higher scrap metal prices 
leasing services segment leasing services revenue was million  million and million for the years ended august   and the million decrease in revenue in compared to was primarily the result of discontinuation of a certain management services contract which was partially offset by higher rents earned on leased railcars for syndication and improved lease rates and increased utilization

as of august  senior secured credit facilities  consisting of three components  aggregated million 
a million revolving line of credit  maturing june  is secured by substantially all of our assets in the us not otherwise pledged as security for term loans 
the facility is available to provide working capital and interim financing of equipment  principally for the us and mexican operations 
advances under this revolving credit facility bear interest at variable rates that depend on the type of borrowing and the defined ratio of debt to total capitalization 
in addition  current lines of credit totaling million secured by certain of our european assets  with various variable rates  are available for working capital needs of the european manufacturing operation 
european credit facilities are continually being renewed 
currently these european credit facilities have maturities that range from april through december in addition  the mexican joint venture line of credit for up to million is secured by certain of the joint venture s accounts receivable and inventory 
advances under this facility bear interest at libor plus and are due days after the date of borrowing 
currently the mexican joint venture can borrow on this facility through july as of august  outstanding borrowings under our facilities consists of million in revolving notes and million in letters of credit outstanding under the north american credit facility  million outstanding under the european credit facilities and million outstanding under the mexican joint venture credit facility 
the revolving and operating lines of credit  along with notes payable  contain covenants with respect to the company and various subsidiaries  the most restrictive of which  among other things  limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness or guarantees  pay dividends or repurchase stock  enter into sale leaseback transactions  create liens  sell assets  engage in transactions with affiliates  including joint ventures and non us subsidiaries  including but not limited to loans  advances  equity investments and guarantees  enter into mergers  consolidations or sales of substantially all the company s assets  and enter into new lines of business 
the covenants also require certain maximum ratios of debt to total capitalization and minimum levels of fixed charges interest plus rent coverage 
available borrowings under our credit facilities are generally based on defined levels of inventory  receivables  property  plant and equipment and leased equipment  as well as total debt to consolidated capitalization and fixed charge coverage ratios which  as of august  would allow for maximum additional borrowing of million 
the company has an aggregate of million available to draw down under the committed credit facilities as of august  this amount consists of million available on the north american credit facility  million on the european credit facilities and million on the mexican joint venture credit facility 
we may from time to time seek to repurchase or otherwise retire or exchange securities  including outstanding borrowings and equity securities  and take other steps to reduce our debt or otherwise improve our balance sheet 
these actions may include open market repurchases  unsolicited or solicited privately negotiated transactions or other retirements  repurchases or exchanges 
such repurchases or exchanges  if any  will depend on a number of factors  including  but not limited to  prevailing market conditions  trading levels of our debt  our liquidity requirements and contractual restrictions  if applicable 
we have operations in mexico and poland that conduct business in their local currencies as well as other regional currencies 
to mitigate the exposure to transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of each entity  we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to protect the margin on a portion of forecast foreign currency sales 
foreign operations give rise to risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we utilize foreign currency forward exchange contracts with established financial institutions to hedge a portion of that risk

the facility was temporarily idled during the economic downturn  but was re opened during the third quarter of we  along with our partners  have made additional equity investments during  of which our share was million 
additional investments will likely be required as production increases 
quarterly dividends were suspended as of the third quarter we expect existing funds and cash generated from operations  together with proceeds from financing activities including borrowings under existing credit facilities and long term financings  to be sufficient to fund working capital needs  planned capital expenditures and expected debt repayments for the next twelve months 
the following table shows our estimated future contractual cash obligations as of august  years ending august  in thousands total thereafter notes payable interest revolving notes purchase commitments operating leases railcar leases other due to uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at august   we are unable to estimate the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority 
therefore  approximately million in uncertain tax positions have been excluded from the contractual table above 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently have off balance sheet arrangements that have or are likely to have a material current or future effect on our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires judgment on the part of management to arrive at estimates and assumptions on matters that are inherently uncertain 
these estimates may affect the amount of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities within the financial statements 
estimates and assumptions are periodically evaluated and may be adjusted in future periods 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
income taxes for financial reporting purposes  income tax expense is estimated based on planned tax return filings 
the amounts anticipated to be reported in those filings may change between the time the financial statements are prepared and the time the tax returns are filed 
further  because tax filings are subject to review by taxing authorities  there is also the risk that a position taken in preparation of a tax return may be challenged by a the greenbrier companies annual report 
table of contents taxing authority 
if the taxing authority is successful in asserting a position different than that taken by us  differences in tax expense or between current and deferred tax items may arise in future periods 
such differences  which could have a material impact on our financial statements  would be reflected in the financial statements when management considers them probable of occurring and the amount reasonably estimable 
valuation allowances reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized 
our estimates of the realization of deferred tax assets is based on the information available at the time the financial statements are prepared and may include estimates of future income and other assumptions that are inherently uncertain 
maintenance obligations we are responsible for maintenance on a portion of the managed and owned lease fleet under the terms of maintenance obligations defined in the underlying lease or management agreement 
the estimated maintenance liability is based on maintenance histories for each type and age of railcar 
these estimates involve judgment as to the future costs of repairs and the types and timing of repairs required over the lease term 
as we cannot predict with certainty the prices  timing and volume of maintenance needed in the future on railcars under long term leases  this estimate is uncertain and could be materially different from maintenance requirements 
the liability is periodically reviewed and updated based on maintenance trends and known future repair or refurbishment requirements 
these adjustments could be material due to the inherent uncertainty in predicting future maintenance requirements 
warranty accruals warranty costs to cover a defined warranty period are estimated and charged to operations 
the estimated warranty cost is based on historical warranty claims for each particular product type 
for new product types without a warranty history  preliminary estimates are based on historical information for similar product types 
these estimates are inherently uncertain as they are based on historical data for existing products and judgment for new products 
if warranty claims are made in the current period for issues that have not historically been the subject of warranty claims and were not taken into consideration in establishing the accrual or if claims for issues already considered in establishing the accrual exceed expectations  warranty expense may exceed the accrual for that particular product 
conversely  there is the possibility that claims may be lower than estimates 
the warranty accrual is periodically reviewed and updated based on warranty trends 
however  as we cannot predict future claims  the potential exists for the difference in any one reporting period to be material 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
railcars are generally manufactured  repaired or refurbished and wheel services and parts produced under firm orders from third parties 
revenue is recognized when these products or services are completed  accepted by an unaffiliated customer and contractual contingencies removed 
certain leases are operated under car hire arrangements whereby revenue is earned based on utilization  car hire rates and terms specified in the lease agreement 
car hire revenue is reported from a third party source two months in arrears  however  such revenue is accrued in the month earned based on estimates of use from historical activity and is adjusted to actual as reported 
these estimates are inherently uncertain as they involve judgment as to the estimated use of each railcar 
adjustments to actual have historically not been significant 
revenues from construction of marine barges are either recognized on the percentage of completion method during the construction period or on the completed contract method based on the terms of the contract 
under the percentage of completion method  judgment is used to determine a definitive threshold against which progress towards completion can be measured to determine timing of revenue recognition 
impairment of long lived assets when changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of certain long lived assets may not be recoverable  the assets are evaluated for impairment 
if the forecast undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets  an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the assets to fair value is recognized in the current period 
these estimates are based on the best information available at the time of the impairment and could be materially different if circumstances change 
if the forecast undiscounted future cash flows exceeded the carrying amount of the assets it would indicate that the assets were not impaired 
the greenbrier companies annual report 
table of contents goodwill and acquired intangible assets the company periodically acquires businesses in purchase transactions in which the allocation of the purchase price may result in the recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates affect the amount of future period amortization and possible impairment charges 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually during the third quarter 
goodwill is also tested more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicates that a potential impairment exists 
the provisions of accounting standards codification asc  intangibles goodwill and other  require that we perform a two step impairment test on goodwill 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value 
we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on a weighting of income and market approaches 
under the income approach  we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
under the market approach  we estimate the fair value based on observed market multiples for comparable businesses 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test is required only in situations where the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value as determined in the first step 
in the second step we would compare the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying value 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill 
the goodwill balance as of august  of million relates to the wheel services  refurbishment parts segment 
goodwill was tested during the third quarter and the company concluded that goodwill was not impaired

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk we have operations in mexico  germany and poland that conduct business in their local currencies as well as other regional currencies 
to mitigate the exposure to transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of each entity  we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to protect the margin on a portion of forecast foreign currency sales 
at august   million of forecast sales in europe were hedged by foreign exchange contracts 
because of the variety of currencies in which purchases and sales are transacted and the interaction between currency rates  it is not possible to predict the impact a movement in a single foreign currency exchange rate would have on future operating results 
we believe the exposure to foreign exchange risk is not material 
in addition to exposure to transaction gains or losses  we are also exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to the net asset position of our foreign subsidiaries 
at august   net assets of foreign subsidiaries aggregated million and a strengthening of the us dollar relative to the foreign currencies would result in a decrease in equity of million  or of total equity greenbrier 
this calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
interest rate risk we have managed a portion of our variable rate debt with interest rate swap agreements  effectively converting million of variable rate debt to fixed rate debt 
as a result  we are exposed to interest rate risk relating to our revolving debt and a portion of term debt  which are at variable rates 
at august   of our outstanding debt has fixed rates and has variable rates 
at august   a uniform increase in interest rates would result in approximately million of additional annual interest expense
