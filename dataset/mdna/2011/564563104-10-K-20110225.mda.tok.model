table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included in item of this document 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
for a description of these forward looking statements  refer to part i forward looking statements 
a description of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results we anticipate include  but are not limited to  those discussed in item a risk factors  as well as discussed elsewhere in this annual report 
overview with approximately  professionals in countries around the world currently  mantech is a leading provider of innovative technologies and solutions for mission critical national security programs for the intelligence community  departments of defense  state and homeland security  the department of justice and the federal bureau of investigations  the space community  the national oceanic and atmospheric administration  and other us federal government customers 
our expertise includes command  control  computers  communications  intelligence  surveillance and reconnaissance cisr lifecycle support  cyber security  global logistics support  intelligence counter intelligence support  information technology modernization sustainment  systems engineering and test evaluation 
we support major national missions  such as military readiness  terrorist threat detection  information security and border protection 
we derive revenues primarily from contracts with us government agencies that are focused on national security and as a result  funding for our programs is generally linked to trends in us government spending in the areas of defense  intelligence  homeland security and other federal agencies 
as it relates to the evolving terrorist threats and world events  the us government has continued to increase its overall defense  intelligence and homeland security budgets 
however this trend may not continue due to the mounting deficit of the us government and public pressure to reduce us government spending 
for the years ended december   and  over of our revenues were derived from our customers in the intelligence community and the department of defense 
these customers include the office of the secretary of defense  the department of state  the department of homeland security  various intelligence agencies  federal intelligence and terrorism task forces  the us army  navy  air force and marine corps  and joint military commands 
we also provide solutions to federal government civilian agencies  including national aeronautics and space administration nasa and patent and trademark office pto  as well as to state and local governments and commercial customers 
the following table shows revenues from each type of customer as a percentage of total revenues for the periods presented 
years ended december  department of defense and intelligence agencies federal civilian agencies state agencies  international agencies and commercial entities total revenues 
table of contents we provide our services and solutions under three types of contracts time and materials  cost reimbursable  and fixed price 
our contract mix varies from year to year due to numerous factors  including our business strategies and federal government procurement objectives 
the following table shows revenues from each of these types of contracts as a percentage of total revenues for the periods presented 
years ended december  time and materials cost reimbursable fixed price total revenues time and materials contracts under time and materials contracts  we are reimbursed for labor at fixed hourly rates and generally reimbursed separately for allowable materials  costs and expenses 
to the extent that our actual labor costs under a time and materials contract are higher or lower than the billing rates under the contract  our profit under the contract may be either greater or less than we anticipated or we may suffer a loss under the contract 
we recognize revenues under time and materials contracts by multiplying the number of direct labor hours expended by the contract billing rates and adding the effect of other billable direct costs 
in general  we realize a higher profit margin on work performed under time and materials contracts than cost reimbursable contracts 
cost reimbursable contracts under cost reimbursable contracts  we are reimbursed for costs that are determined to be reasonable  allowable and allocable to the contract and paid a fee representing the profit margin negotiated between us and the contracting agency  which may be fixed or performance based 
under cost reimbursable contracts we recognize revenues and an estimate of applicable fees earned as costs are incurred 
we consider fixed fees under cost reimbursable contracts to be earned in proportion to the allowable costs incurred in performance of the contract 
for performance based fees under cost reimbursable contracts  we recognize the relevant portion of the expected fee to be awarded by the client at the time such fee can be reasonably estimated  based on factors such as our prior award experience and communications with the client regarding performance 
for cost reimbursable contracts with performance based fee incentives that are subject to the provisions of sec topic  revenue recognition  we recognize the relevant portion of the fee upon customer approval 
in general  cost reimbursable contracts are the least profitable of our government contracts and lowest risk of financial loss 
fixed price contracts under fixed price contracts  we perform specific tasks for a fixed price 
compared to cost reimbursable and time and materials contracts  fixed price contracts generally offer higher profit margin opportunities but involve greater financial risk because we bear the impact of cost overruns in return for the full benefit of any cost savings 
we generally do not undertake complex  high risk work  such as long term software development  under fixed price terms 
fixed price contracts may include either a product delivery or specific service performance over a defined period 
revenue on fixed price contracts that provide for the company to render services throughout a period is recognized as earned according to contract terms as the service is provided on a proportionate performance basis 
these contracts are generally less than six months in duration 
for fixed price contracts that provide for the delivery of a specific product with related customer acceptance provisions  revenues are recognized as those products are delivered and accepted 
we derive a majority of our revenues from contracts directly with the us government or as a subcontractor to other providers of services to the us government 
the following table shows our revenues as prime contractor and as subcontractor as a percentage of our total revenues for the following periods years ended december  prime contract revenues subcontract revenues total revenues 
table of contents our prime contract revenues as a percentage of our total revenues increased from to largely due to the acquisition of sti  in which we gained access as a prime contractor to the strategic services sourcing s vehicle 
our prime contract revenues as a percentage of our total revenues increased from to largely due to our receipt of a sole source prime contract award in to continue and expand our support for the route clearance family of vehicle contracts as well as expansion of our support for mrap vehicles and growth in our cyber security efforts 
revenues substantially all of our revenue is derived from services and solutions provided to the federal government or to prime contractors supporting the federal government  including services provided by our employees  our subcontractors and through solutions that include third party hardware and software that we purchase and integrate as a part of our overall solutions 
these requirements may vary from period to period depending on specific contract and client requirements 
since we earn higher profits from labor services that our employees provide compared with subcontracted efforts and other reimbursable items such as hardware and software purchases for clients  we seek to optimize our labor services on all of our engagements 
cost of services cost of services primarily includes direct costs incurred to provide our services and solutions to customers 
the most significant portion of these costs are direct labor costs  including salaries and wages  plus associated fringe benefits of our employees directly serving customers  in addition to the related management  facilities and infrastructure costs 
cost of services also includes other direct costs  such as the costs of subcontractors and outside consultants and third party materials  including hardware or software that we purchase and provide to the customer as part of an integrated solution 
since we earn higher profits on our own labor services  we expect the ratio of cost of services as a percent of revenues to decline when our labor services mix increases relative to subcontracted labor or third party materials 
conversely  as subcontracted labor or third party material purchases for customers increase relative to our own labor services  we expect the ratio of cost of services as a percent of revenue to increase 
changes in the mix of services and equipment provided under our contracts can result in variability in our contract margins 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses include the salaries and wages  plus associated fringe benefits of our employees not performing work directly for clients  and associated facilities costs 
among the functions covered by these costs are corporate business development  bid and proposal  contracts administration  finance and accounting  legal  corporate governance and executive and senior management 
in addition  we included stock based compensation  as well as depreciation and amortization expense related to the general and administrative function for the year ended december  depreciation and amortization expenses include the depreciation of computers  furniture and other equipment  the amortization of third party software we use internally  leasehold improvements and intangible assets 
identifiable intangible assets include customer relationships and contract backlogs acquired in business combinations  and are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
interest expense interest expense is primarily related to interest expense incurred or accrued under our outstanding borrowings  our senior secured notes and deferred financing charges 
interest income interest income is primarily from cash on hand and notes receivable 

table of contents results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  consolidated statements of income the following table sets forth certain items from our consolidated statements of income and the relative percentages that certain items of expense and earnings bear to revenues as well as the year over year change from december  to december  years ended december  year to year change to dollars percentages dollars percent dollars in thousands revenues cost of services general and administrative expenses operating income interest expense interest income other expense income  net income from operations before income taxes provision for income taxes net income revenues revenues increased to billion for the year ended december   compared to billion for the same period in the increase was primarily due to our acquisitions of sti on january  cisr services contributed revenue growth of million  including million from contracts obtained through the acquisition of sti 
revenue growth of million came from our cyber security related contracts 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease due to lower procurement of materials on our contracts for installation  sustainment and repair of communication systems and heavily armored vehicles designed to counter or clear mines and improvised explosive devices ied  such as the route clearance family of vehicles supporting us army tacom 
we are expecting the growth in revenues to continue in as a result of our recent acquisitions and continued expansion due to recent wins in the areas of cisr and cyber security 
however we recognize that the government has expressed its intention to decrease its budgets related to professional and technical services contracts in the coming years 
cost of services cost of services increased to billion for the year ended december   compared to billion for the same period in the increase in cost of services is primarily due to our acquisition of sti 
as a percentage of revenues  cost of services increased to for the year as compared to for the same period in direct labor costs  which include applicable fringe benefits and overhead  increased over the period in primarily due to growth in staff supporting global logistics  supply chain management and isr programs  as well as our acquisitions 
as a percentage of revenues  direct labor costs decreased to for the year ended december   as compared to for the same period in the decrease in direct labor as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to the relative mix of direct labor and other direct costs 
other direct costs  which include subcontractors and third party equipment and materials used in the performance of 
table of contents our contracts  increased by over the same period in the increase in other direct costs was primarily due to subcontractors related to sti contracts 
as a percentage of revenues  other direct costs increased from for the year ended december  to for the same period in the increase of other direct costs as a percentage of revenues is primarily due to the relative mix of direct labor and other direct costs 
we expect cost of services in fiscal year to be relatively consistent with as a percentage of revenues 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in the increase is primarily due to the amortization of intangible assets from our acquisitions 
as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses decreased to from for the years ended december  and  respectively due to the leveraging of our general and administrative expense over a larger base 
we expect general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue to decrease in as a result of higher revenues from our recent acquisitions 
interest expense interest expense increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in we incurred million of interest expense for the year ended december  related to our senior unsecured notes issued in april we utilized proceeds from the note issuance to pay off all outstanding borrowings under our credit facility 
borrowings under our credit facility were used to finance the acquisition of sti 
the interest rate on the senior unsecured notes is higher than interest currently available to us under our credit facility 
we expect interest expense to increase in due to incurring twelve months of interest on our senior unsecured notes compared to eight months in interest income interest income increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in there was increased average cash on hand  which generated interest income during the period 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in our effective income tax rates were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in our effective tax rate from december  was primarily due to increased state income taxes as a result of the sti acquisition 
net income net income increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in the increase is due to higher revenues  which are primarily driven by our acquisitions 

table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  consolidated statements of income the following table sets forth certain items from our consolidated statements of income and the relative percentages that certain items of expense and earnings bear to revenues as well as the year over year change from december  to december  years ended december  year to year change to dollars percentages dollars percent dollars in thousands revenues cost of services general and administrative expenses operating income interest expense interest income other income expense  net income from operations before income taxes provision for income taxes net income revenues revenues increased to billion for the year ended december   compared to billion for the same period in the increase was primarily due to our contracts supporting forward deployments in iraq  afghanistan and other areas around the world and our acquisitions of emerging technologies group  inc etg in august  ewa services  inc ewa in november and ddk in march revenue growth of million came from contracts for the installation  sustainment and repair of communication systems and heavily armored vehicles designed to counter or clear mines and ieds  such as the route clearance family of vehicles supporting us army tacom 
significant cyber security contracts contributed revenue growth of million  including million from contracts transferred through the acquisitions of etg and ddk 
the acquisition of ewa contributed a revenue increase of million 
these increases were partially offset by a decline in certain space related work and other 
cost of services cost of services increased to billion for the year ended december   compared to billion for the same period in the increase in cost of services is primarily due to direct labor  which includes applicable fringe benefits and overhead related to our ied and cyber security contracts and our recent acquisitions of ewa and ddk 
as a percentage of revenues  cost of services decreased to for the year as compared to for the same period in direct labor costs increased by over the period in primarily due to growth in staff supporting global logistics and supply chain management and acquisitions 
as a percentage of revenues  direct labor costs increased to for the year ended december   as compared to for the same period in other direct costs  which include subcontractors and third party equipment and materials used in the performance of our contracts  increased by over the same period in the increase in other direct costs was primarily due to an increase in purchases of equipment and materials on our contracts for installation and repair of systems designed to counter or clear mines and ieds 
as a percentage of revenues  other direct costs decreased from for the year ended december  to for the same period in the decrease of other direct costs as a percentage of revenues can be attributed to the ied programs gradual transition of materials procurement to the government procurement offices 

table of contents general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses increased to from for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase as a percentage of revenues was due to systems and staff requirements needed to support increased demands for materials and services  business development and system improvements costs 
we have increased expense for internal compliance monitoring and process improvement costs due to the current trend of amplified government regulation and review 
interest expense interest expense decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in the decrease in interest expense is due to a decrease in our average outstanding debt balance 
our average outstanding debt balance for the year ended december  was million as compared to million for the year ended december  the interest rate we incur on our credit facility is impacted by changes in the federal funds rate or london interbank offer rate libor 
changes in these lending rates could lead to fluctuations in our interest expense in future periods 
interest income interest income decreased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in the fluctuation is due to a reduction in the interest rate related to our cash accounts for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in our effective income tax rates were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in our effective tax rate from december  was largely due to the impact of deductible gains related to our employee supplemental savings plan 
net income net income increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in the increase is a result of higher revenues and improved margins primarily driven by increased demand for direct labor projects 
backlog for the years ended december   and our backlog was billion  billion and billion  respectively  of which billion  billion and billion  respectively  was funded backlog 
backlog represents estimates that we calculate on a consistent basis 
for additional information on how we compute backlog  see backlog in item at december   sti  s is and mtcsc contributed approximately billion in backlog combined 
significant wins for the year ended december  include contracts from the us air force launch and range systems wing lrsw to provide systems engineering and integration services to support current and future space launch operations  the us army to provide base expeditionary target surveillance systems combined betss c operators and related support services in iraq  
table of contents the department of homeland security to provide program management office support services pmoss in support of the secure border initiative sbi effort  the federal bureau of investigation fbi to provide cyber security services  including intrusion detection monitoring  security engineering  cyber threat analysis  vulnerability assessment and penetration testing  the us army to provide integrated logistics support services for elevated sensors systems in south west asia  the us navy naval warfare centers to provide engineering  programmatic  training and technical support services  and the us army to provide expeditionary cellular communications service eccs in afghanistan 
effects of inflation inflation and uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment  such as conditions in the financial markets  could impact our labor rates beyond the predetermined escalation factors 
however  we generally have been able to price our contracts in a manner to accommodate the rates of inflation experienced in recent years 
under our time and materials contracts  labor rates are usually adjusted annually by predetermined escalation factors 
our cost reimbursable contracts automatically adjust for changes in cost 
under our fixed price contracts  we include a predetermined escalation factor  but generally  we have not been adversely affected by near term inflation 
purchases of equipments and materials directly for contracts are usually cost reimbursable 
in addition  inflation or inflationary concerns could prompt the federal reserve to begin increasing the federal funds rate 
as one of the borrowing rates in our credit facility is tied to the federal funds rate  increases in this rate  given similar levels of debt  could lead to higher interest expense 
liquidity and capital resources our primary liquidity needs are the financing of acquisitions  working capital and capital expenditures 
our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations and our revolving credit facility 
in addition  we issued million of unsecured notes in april on december   the company s cash and cash equivalents balance was million 
at december   there was no outstanding balance under our credit facility 
at december   we were contingently liable under letters of credit totaling million  which reduces our ability to borrow under our credit facility 
the maximum available borrowings under our credit facility at december  was million 
at december   we had million outstanding of our unsecured notes outstanding 
in april  we utilized the proceeds from the senior unsecured notes issuance to pay off the outstanding balance under our credit facility and the remainder was utilized to fund acquisitions 
generally  cash provided by operating activities is adequate to fund our operations 
due to fluctuations in our cash flows and the growth in our operations  it is necessary from time to time to increase borrowings under our credit facility to meet cash demands 
our credit facility could also be used to fund future acquisitions 
cash flows from operating activities year ended december  in thousands net cash flow from operating activities of continuing operations 
table of contents our operating cash flow is primarily affected by the overall profitability of our contracts  our ability to invoice and collect from our clients in a timely manner and our ability to manage our vendor payments 
we bill most of our clients and prime contractors monthly after services are rendered 
increased cash flows from operations for the year ended december  compared to the same period for was a result of the timing of vendor payments and accrued salaries  increased net income and amortization expense  partially offset by the timing of receivables 
our accounts receivable days outstanding ratio was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
increased cash flow from operations for the year ended december  compared to the same period in was due to the timing of the collection of customer receivables offset by the timing of vendor and other direct cost payments 
the timing and amounts of cash collections from our customers can vary significantly based primarily on the procedures requested by the us government to approve such payments 
cash flows from investing activities year ended december  in thousands net investing cash flow from continuing operations our cash flow from investing activities consists primarily of capital expenditures  leasehold improvements  software and business acquisitions 
cash outflows in were primarily due to the acquisitions of sti on january  for million  s is on october  for million and mtcsc on december  for million as well as capital expenditures for million 
cash outflows in were primarily due to the acquisition of ddk on march  for million  as well as purchases of equipment and software for internal use 
cash outflows in were primarily from our acquisition of etg on august  for million  our acquisition of ewa on november  for million and purchases of equipment and software for internal use 
cash flows from financing activities year ended december  in thousands net cash flow from financing activities cash flow from financing during resulted primarily from the issuance of senior unsecured notes for million and the proceeds from the exercise of stock options  offset by debt issuance costs 
the proceeds from our notes issuance were utilized to payoff outstanding amounts under our credit facility 
cash flow from financing during resulted primarily from the payments under our credit facility of million partially offset by the proceeds from the exercise of stock options of million 
cash used in financing activities during resulted primarily from paying down our credit facility with cash from operations  this was slightly offset by borrowings under our credit facility to finance our acquisitions of ewa and etg and proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
revolving credit facility on december   we amended our revolving credit agreement to allow for additional flexibility in negative covenants  and specifically to increase the allowable acquisition limitation  the amount of unsecured debt the company may have and the amount of stock that we may repurchase pursuant to a share repurchase program 

table of contents the amended credit agreement provides for a revolving credit facility of up to million 
the credit agreement includes a million letter of credit sublimit and a million swing line loan sublimit 
the maturity date for the credit agreement is april  borrowings under the amended credit agreement are collateralized by our assets and bear interest at one of the following rates as selected by the company a libor based rate plus market rate spreads that are determined based on the company s leverage ratio calculation to  or the lender s base rate plus spreads of up to  which is the highest of the prime rate  the sum of plus the federal funds rate  and  except during a eurodollar unavailability period  plus the eurodollar rate 
the terms of the credit agreement permit prepayment and termination of the loan commitments at any time  subject to certain conditions 
the credit agreement requires the company to comply with specified financial covenants  including the maintenance of a certain leverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio 
the credit agreement also contains various covenants  including affirmative covenants with respect to certain reporting requirements and maintaining certain business activities  and negative covenants that  among other things  may limit our ability to incur liens  incur additional indebtedness  make investments  make acquisitions  pay cash dividends and undertake certain additional actions 
as of december   we were in compliance with our financial covenants under the credit agreement 
at december  and  there was no outstanding balance under our credit facility 
senior unsecured notes effective april   the company issued million of senior unsecured notes in a private placement that were resold inside the united states to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on rule a under the securities act of  and outside the united states to non us persons in reliance on regulation s under securities act of a portion of the proceeds from the issuance was used to pay off the outstanding balance under our credit agreement 
pursuant to the terms of the registration rights agreement entered into in connection with the issuance of the senior unsecured notes  on august  mantech completed the exchange of million in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due that are registered under the securities act of  as amended  for all of the then outstanding unregistered senior unsecured notes due as of december   the company was in compliance with all covenants required by the indenture 
we believe the capital resources available to us under our credit agreement with up to million in loan commitments and cash from our operations are adequate to fund our ongoing operations and to support the internal growth we expect to achieve for at least the next twelve months 
we anticipate financing our external growth from acquisitions and our longer term internal growth through one or more of the following sources cash from operations  use of the existing revolving facility  additional senior unsecured notes  and additional borrowing or issuance of equity 
short term borrowings from time to time  we borrow funds against our revolving credit facility for working capital requirements and funding of operations as well as acquisitions 
borrowings under our revolving credit facility bear interest at one of the following rates as selected by the company a libor based rate plus market rate spreads that are determined based on the company s leverage ratio calculation to  or the lender s base rate plus spreads of up to 
in april of  we used the proceeds from the issuance of the senior unsecured notes to repay all outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
since then  we have not drawn any funds against the revolving credit facility 
in the next twelve months we may use  as needed  our revolving credit facility in order to fund our ongoing operations and support our internal and external growth 

table of contents the following table summarizes the activity under our revolving credit facility for the years ended december   and year ended december  in thousands borrowings under revolving credit facility repayment of borrowings under revolving credit facility cash management to the extent possible  we invest our available cash in short term  investment grade securities in accordance with our investment policy 
under our investment policy  we manage our investments  in accordance with the priorities of maintaining the safety of our principal  maintaining the liquidity of our investments  maximizing the yield on our investments and investing our cash to the fullest extent possible

table of contents critical accounting estimates and policies critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
application of these policies is particularly important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies  including the critical policies listed below  are more fully described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
revenue recognition and cost estimation we recognize revenues when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  services have been rendered  the contract price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
we have a standard internal process that we use to determine whether all required criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
our revenues consist primarily of services provided by our employees and the pass through of costs for materials and subcontract efforts under contracts with our customers 
cost of services consists primarily of compensation expenses for program personnel  the fringe benefits associated with this compensation and other direct expenses incurred to complete programs  including cost of materials and subcontract efforts 
we derive the majority of our revenue from cost plus fixed fee  cost plus award fee  firm fixed price or time and materials contracts 
revenues for cost reimbursable contracts are recorded as reimbursable costs are incurred  including an estimated share of the applicable contractual fees earned 
for performance based fees under cost reimbursable contracts  that are subject to the accounting standards codifications asc  construction type and certain production type contracts  we recognize the relevant portion of the expected fee to be awarded by the client at the time such fee can be reasonably estimated  based on factors such as our prior award experience and communications with the client regarding performance 
for cost reimbursable contracts with performance based fee incentives that are subject to the provisions of sec topic  revenue recognition  we recognize the relevant portion of the fee upon customer approval 
for time and material contracts  revenue is recognized to the extent of billable rates times hours delivered plus material and other reimbursable costs incurred 
for long term fixed price production contracts  revenue is recognized at a rate per unit as the units are delivered or by other methods to measure services provided 
revenue from other long term fixed price contracts is recognized ratably over the contract period or by other appropriate methods to measure services provided 
contract costs are expensed as incurred except for certain limited long term contracts noted below 
for long term contracts as described in asc  we apply the percentage of completion method 
under the percentage of completion method  income is recognized at a consistent profit margin over the period of performance based on estimated profit margins at completion of the contract 
this method of accounting requires estimating the total revenues and total contract cost at completion of the contract 
during the performance of long term contracts  these estimates are periodically reviewed and revisions are made as required 
the impact on revenue and contract profit as a result of these revisions is included in the periods in which the revisions are made 
this method can result in the deferral of costs or the deferral of profit on these contracts 
because we assume the risk of performing a fixed price contract at a set price  the failure to accurately estimate ultimate costs or to control costs during performance of the work could result  and in some instances has resulted  in reduced profits or losses for such contracts 
estimated losses on contracts at completion are recognized when identified 
in certain circumstances  revenues are recognized when contract amendments have not been finalized 

table of contents accounting for business combinations and goodwill the purchase price of an acquired business is allocated to the tangible assets  financial assets and separately recognized intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values  with the excess recorded as goodwill 
such fair value assessments require judgments and estimates that can be affected by contract performance and other factors over time  which may cause final amounts to differ materially from original estimates 
we review goodwill at least annually for impairment 
we have elected to perform this review annually during the second quarter of each calendar year 
no adjustments were necessary as a result of this review during the quarter end june  whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long lived asset may not be fully recoverable  we evaluate the probability that future undiscounted net cash flows  without interest charges  will be less than carrying amount of assets 
if any impairment were indicated as a result of this review  we recognize a loss based on the amount by which that carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value 
due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a reporting unit s fair value and the relative size of the company s recorded goodwill  differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the results of the company s impairment analysis
