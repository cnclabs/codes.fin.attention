digital media adapters our mediamvp hd is a linux based digital media device  and is one of a new class of pc products which link tv sets and pcs 
media  such as music  digital pictures  and digital videos  are transmitted from the pc  where they are stored  to the mediamvp  where they are converted from a digital format into an analog format  enabling playback on a tv connected to the mediamvp 
mediamvp was introduced to the market in fiscal  and the first shipments to customers were made at the start of our fiscal year 
our mediamvp enables a user to watch and listen to pc based videos  music and pictures on a tv set through a home network 
the mediamvp connects to tv sets or home theater systems and  via an ethernet network  plays back mp music  mpeg and mpeg videos  and jpeg and gif digital pictures that have been recorded and stored on a pc 
the mediamvp decodes this media and then outputs video through composite and s video connections for high quality video on tv sets and high quality audio through stereo audio output connectors to tv sets or home theater systems

technology video recorder technology our hd pvr and colossus high definition video recorders accept video from a component video source  such as the output of a cable tv or satellite set top box  or a video game console such as an xbox or playstation hauppauge uses hd video encoder chips from ambarella or vixs inside these products to compress the component video into an h 
form 
h 
is the compression technology used in blu ray dvd discs and is high quality 
this compressed high definition video is then stored on the computers disc drive 
once on the disc drive  a user can playback the video recording in hd  burn the video recording onto a blu ray compatible dvd disc  or upload the video recording to youtube 
we have a continuing engineering effort to deliver higher quality video recordings 
in addition  we are developing support in our hd video recorders for third party applications such as microsoft s media center application 
digital tv receiver technology our wintv d board  developed during the fiscal year and delivered to the market in the beginning of fiscal  was the first atsc digital tv tuner for the north american market which allowed pcs to receive  display and record over the air digital tv signals 
atsc digital television is the digital tv standard for north america which has replaced analog television in the united states and canada 
in the us  all analog over the air television transmissions have ceased as of june  and only digital tv transmissions are broadcast 
since our first atsc digital tv tuner delivered in  we have introduced new digital tv tuners for use in north america 
in fiscal  we also introduced the wintv dvb board for the european market 
this board brings european digital tv to pcs  and is based on the digital video broadcast standard 
both the wintv d and the wintv dvb have the ability to receive special data broadcasts which some broadcasters may send along with the digital tv signal  in addition to displaying digital tv in a resizable window 
data broadcasts on digital tv are transmitted at several million bits per second 
our proprietary software can decode and display some of these special data broadcasts 
we may work on standardized reception and display software  if such broadcasts become standardized 
the software to control the digital tv reception is based on our wintv software  which was developed during fiscal and has had a major update in and over the two fiscal years ended september   we have further developed the digital tv reception capabilities of our digital family of products and as of september  we have products for dvb t terrestrial  dvb s and dvb s satellite  atsc and clear qam digital tv reception 
in addition  there are seven pctv products which allow digital tv to be watched on a pc or notebook computer 
our mediamvp is a device which allows tv recordings which are stored on a pc or notebook computer to be viewed on a tv set 
based on the linux operating system  the mediamvp works in a client server system with a pc  communicating with the pc server and receiving digital media from the pc and displaying the media on the tv set 
the core technology to the mediamvp comprises the configuration and enhancements to the linux operating system  the user interface displayed on the tv set  and the technology to transmit digital media reliably over the local area network 
the mediamvp is available in a wired or wireless version 
analog tv receiver technology we have developed four generations of products which convert analog video into digital video since our first such product was introduced in the first generation of wintv products put the tv image on the pc screen using chroma keying  requiring a dedicated feature connector cable between the wintv and the vga video board 
our initial customers were mostly professional pc users  such as financial market professionals who needed to be able to view stock market related tv shows while spending many hours on their pcs  who found having tv in a window on their desktop useful and entertaining 
in  we invented a technique called smartlock  which eliminated the need for the feature connector cable 
in june  we introduced the wintv pci line of tv tuner boards for pcs 
these boards were developed to eliminate the relatively expensive smartlock circuitry and memory used on the wintv celebrity and cinemapro products 
the fourth generation analog tv tuners were wintv pvr models which were first developed during fiscal and introduced to the market in early fiscal the wintv pvrs include both internal pci and external usb tv tuners which are designed to add the ability to record tv shows to a pc s hard disk 
the core technology in the wintv pvr products is a hardware mpeg encoder  which compresses analog video from a tv tuner or external video source into an mpeg format in real time 
research and development our research and development efforts are focused on both extending the range of our current tv receiver and high definition video recording products  plus developing new features for our wintv and wintv extend software products 
we intend to develop more highly integrated versions of hardware products to further improve performance and price points  and new versions of software to add features  improve ease of use  and provide support for new operating systems 
as of september  we had three research and development operations one based in our hauppauge  new york headquarters  one based in taipei  taiwan  roc and one in braunschweig  germany 
the new york and taiwan r d operations are aimed at extending the range and features of our high definition video recorders and digital analog tv receiver products 
the pctv systems research and development operation is based in braunschweig  germany  and is responsible for the updating and enhancement of broadway and developing other pctv products 
the technology underlying our products and certain other products in the computer industry  in general  is subject to rapid change  including the potential introduction of new types of products and technologies  which may have a material adverse impact upon our business 
see  item a risk factors 
we maintain an ongoing research and development program 
our future success  of which there can be no assurances  will depend  in part  on our ability to respond quickly to technological advances by developing and introducing new products  successfully incorporating such advances in existing products  and obtaining licenses  patents  or other proprietary technologies to be used in connection with new or existing products 
we continue to invest in research and development 
we spent approximately  and  for research and development expenses for the years ended september  and  respectively 
there can be no assurance that our current and future research and development will be successful or that we will be able to foresee  and respond to  advances in technological developments and to successfully develop other products 
additionally  there can be no assurances that the development of technologies and products by competitors will not render our products or technologies non competitive or obsolete 
see item a risk factors 
production and suppliers we design the hardware for most models of the wintv  pctv and mediamvp products  and also write the operating software to be used in conjunction with the microsoft windows operating system and the apple ios operating system 
during fiscal  we sub contracted the manufacturing and assembly of most of our products to six independent third parties at facilities in various asian countries 
we monitor and test the quality of the completed products at any one of our facilities in the us hauppauge  new york  singapore or ireland before packaging the products and shipping them to our customers 
we also buy some models of tv tuner products  such as the wintv nova t stick from other unrelated third party companies  add hauppauge software and sell under our name or on a private label basis 
certain component parts  such as tv tuners  video decoder chips and video compression chips  plus certain assembled products  such as the wintv hvr stick products that are essential to our business  are available from a single source or limited sources 
other essential component parts that are generally available from multiple sources may be obtained by us from only a single source or limited sources because of pricing concerns 
see item a risk factors 
components are subject to industry wide availability and pricing pressures 
any availability limitations  interruption in supplies  or price increases could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  our new products may initially utilize custom components obtained from only one source 
see item a risk factors 
we typically attempt to evaluate and qualify additional suppliers for these components 
where a product utilizes a new component  initial capacity constraints of the supplier of that component may exist until such time as the supplier yields have matured 
components are normally acquired through purchase orders  either issued by us or by our contract manufacturers  typically covering our requirements for a day period from the date of issue 
purchased assembled products are normally covered by longer term purchase orders 
our principal suppliers of component parts are arrow electronics  dibcom sa  nxp semiconductors  trident microsystems  wt microelectronics singapore pte ltd and conexant systems 
if the supply of a key component  or a purchased assembled product  were to be delayed or curtailed  or in the event a key manufacturing vendor delays shipment of completed products to us or our contract manufacturer  our ability to ship products in desired quantities  and in a timely manner  will be adversely affected 
our business  operating results and financial condition will likely be adversely affected  depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source or  if possible  to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source 
see item a risk factors 
we attempt to mitigate these potential risks by working closely with our key suppliers on product introduction plans  strategic inventories  coordinated product introductions  and internal and external manufacturing schedules and levels 
we have  from time to time  experienced significant price increases and limited availability of certain components 
similar occurrences in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
see item a risk factors 
during fiscal and  all hd pvr  wintv  pctv and mediamvp manufacturing was performed by six unrelated contract manufacturers in asia 
product design specifications are provided by our engineering team to ensure proper assembly 
contract manufacturing is primarily done on a consignment basis  in which we provide all the significant component parts and we pay for assembly charges and for certain additional parts for each board produced 
some products are purchased on a turnkey basis  in which all components and labor are provided by the manufacturer  and the manufacturing price includes parts and assembly costs 
we monitor the quality of the finished product produced by our contract manufacturers 
as of september   we had six qualified contract manufacturers located in malaysia  indonesia  taiwan and china  who are capable of producing our products to our standards 
if demand were to increase dramatically  we believe additional production could be absorbed by these qualified contract manufacturers 
for fiscal and we did not engage any contract manufacturers in europe or north america 
customer service and technical support we maintain customer service and technical support departments in our hauppauge  new york headquarters  as well as in the uk  germany  france  italy  scandinavia  taiwan and in singapore 
technical support is provided to help with installation problems or pre sale and post sale questions on our products  while customer service provides repair service in accordance with our warranty policy free of charge for product that is within the warranty period 
customers and markets we primarily market our products to the personal computer market  including both microsoft windows and apple macintosh based systems 
to reach this market  we sell to a network of computer retailers in the us  europe and asia and through computer products distributors and manufacturers 
to attract new users to our products  from time to time we run special promotions and participate in cooperative advertising with computer retailers 
we actively participate in trade shows to educate and train key computer retail marketing personnel 
most of our sales and marketing budget is aimed at the consumer market 
apart from the typical home user  we also target business users 
one example of a business application is in the securities brokerage industry where our product is primarily used to display financial tv shows in a window on a broker s pc screen while the pc continues to receive financial information 
we have sold our wintv products on a direct corporate sales basis to two large financial services information providers for incorporation into their workstations  and several independent financial institutions 
this market segment is typically project based 
we also offer our products to pc manufacturers that either embed a wintv product in a pc that they sell  or sell the wintv as an accessory to the pc 
sales channels for our products we primarily sell through a sales channel which consist of retailers  pc manufacturers and distributors 
we have no exclusive distributors and retailers 
for fiscal we had one customer  best buy  that accounted for about of our net sales 
for fiscal no one customer accounted for more than of our net sales 
our pctv products are offered as our high end line and are sold through similar retail and distribution channels as our wintv products 
marketing and sales we market our products both domestically and internationally through our sales offices in the us new york and california  germany  the united kingdom  france  taiwan and singapore  plus sales representative offices in the netherlands  spain  scandinavia  poland and italy 
for the fiscal  approximately of our sales were made within the united states while approximately were made outside the united states 
for the fiscal  approximately of our sales were made within the united states while approximately were made outside the united states 
more information on our geographic segments can be obtained from item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and the notes to the consolidated financial statements which comprise part of this annual report on form k 
from time to time  we advertise our products in a number of consumer computer magazines 
we also participate in retailers market promotion programs  such as store circulars and promotions and retail store displays 
these in store promotional programs  magazine advertisements  plus a public relations program aimed at editors of key pc computer magazines and an active website on the internet  are the principal means of getting our product introduced to end users 
our sales in computer retail stores are closely related to the effectiveness of these programs  along with the technical capabilities of the products 
we also list our products in catalogs of various mail order companies and attend trade shows 
we have fifteen sales people located in europe  one sales person in the far east and two sales people in the us in addition to our sales people we also utilize the services of manufacturer representatives in the united states and manufacturer representatives in europe 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations with reference to a discussion on the impact seasonality has on our sales 
foreign currency fluctuations for each of the fiscal years ended september  and  at least of our sales were generated by our european subsidiary and were invoiced and collected in local currency  which is primarily the euro 
on the supply side  since we predominantly deal with north american and asian suppliers and contract manufacturers  approximately of our inventory required to support our european sales is purchased and paid in us dollars 
the combination of sales billed in euros supported by inventory purchased in us dollars results in an absence of a natural local currency hedge 
consequently  our financial results are subject to market risks resulting from the fluctuations in the euro to us dollar exchange rates 
see item a risk factors and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
competition our business is subject to significant competition 
competition exists from larger companies that possess substantially greater technical  financial  human  sales and marketing resources than we do 
the dynamics of competition in this market involve short product life cycles  declining selling prices  evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions 
we compete against a number of asian and european companies 
our wintv dcr digital cablecard receiver competes in the cable tv set top box market with motorola  scientific atlanta  a subsidiary of cisco systems inc and with tivo inc our broadway product competes in the consumer electronics market  where competition comes from sling media  a subsidiary of echostar corporation  and others 
our hd pvr product competes in the video recorder market with roxio  a subsidiary of rovi corporation 
our win tv tv tuner products compete in the pc peripheral market where competition comes from a number of large asian suppliers 
there can be no assurance that we will not experience increased competition in the future 
such increased competition may have a material adverse affect on our ability to successfully market our products 
competition is expected to remain intense and  as a result  we may lose some of our market share to our competitors 
further  we believe that the market for our products will continue to be price competitive and thus we could continue to experience lower selling prices  lower gross profit margins and reduced profitability levels for such products than in the past 
item a risk factors 
though management believes that the delivery of tv via the internet will become more popular in the future  we believe that tv delivered via cable  broadcast or satellite will continue to dominate the way consumers watch live television 
since our products connect directly to cable  broadcast and satellite tuners  we view our products as the preferred way to watch and record tv on the pc 
patents  copyrights and trademarks with the proliferation of new products and rapidly changing technology  there is a significant volume of patents and other intellectual property rights held by third parties with regard to our market 
there are a number of companies that hold patents for various aspects of the technologies incorporated in some of the pc and tv industries standards 
given the nature of our products and development efforts  there are risks that claims associated with such patents or intellectual property rights could be asserted by third parties against us 
we expect that parties seeking to gain competitive advantages will increase their efforts to enforce any patent or intellectual property rights that they may have 
the holders of patents from which we may have not obtained licenses may take the position that we are required to obtain a license from them 
if a patent holder refuses to offer such a license or offers such a license on terms unacceptable to us  there is a risk of incurring substantial litigation or settlement costs regardless of the merits of the allegations or which party eventually prevails 
if we do not prevail in a litigation suit  we may be required to pay significant damages and or cease sales and production of infringing products and accordingly  may incur significant defense costs 
additionally  we may need to attempt to design around a given technology  although there can be no assurances that this would be possible or economical 
we currently use technology licensed from third parties in certain products 
our business  financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected by a number of factors relating to these third party technologies  including failure by a licensor to accurately develop  timely introduce  promote or support the technology delays in shipment of products excess customer support or product return costs due to problems with licensed technology and termination of our relationship with such licensors we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property through patent  copyright  trademark and other means of protection 
if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property  our intellectual property rights may be misappropriated by others  invalidated or challenged  and our competitors could duplicate our technology or may otherwise limit any competitive technological advantage we may have 
due to the rapid pace of technological change  we believe our success is likely to depend more upon continued innovation  technical expertise  marketing skills and customer support and service rather than upon legal protection of our proprietary rights 
however  we intend to aggressively assert our intellectual property rights when necessary 
even though we independently develop most of our products and copyright the operating software which our products use  our success will depend  in a large part  on our ability to innovate  obtain or license patents  protect trade secrets and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others 
we maintain copyrights on certain of our designs and software programs  but currently we have no patent on the wintv board or other products 
the trademarks hauppauge  softpvr  hardpvr  mediamvp and wintv have been registered with the united states patent and trademark office

item a 
risk factors our operating results and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties  including those described below  that could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition  any of which could negatively affect the trading price of our common stock 
because of the following factors  as well as other variables affecting our business  operating results and financial condition  past performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance  and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends for future periods 
if our technology is not accepted  we will not be able to sustain or expand our business 
our future success depends on the growing use and acceptance of tv tuner products  video products for pcs and internet based video technology 
the market for these products and technology is still evolving  and may not develop to the extent necessary to enable us to further expand our business 
we have invested  and continue to invest  significant time and resources in the development of new products for this market 
our dependence on sales of tv tuner products  video recording products for the pc and internet based video technology lack of market diversification concentration on the north american and european market for the majority of our sales potential inability to remain ahead of the development of competing technologies could each have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition if we are unable to address any of the factors listed above 
we rely upon sales of a small number of product lines  and the failure of any one product line to be successful in the market could substantially reduce our sales 
we currently rely upon sales from our existing product lines to generate our sales 
while we continue to develop additional products within these and other product lines  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in doing so 
consequently  if the existing or future products are not successful  sales could decline substantially  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we rely heavily on the success of retailers  dealers and pc manufacturers to market  sell and distribute our products 
if these channels are not effective in distributing our products  our sales could be reduced 
these retailers  dealers and pc manufacturers may not effectively promote or market our products or they may experience financial difficulties and even close operations 
our sales channels are not contractually obligated to sell our products  and they typically sell on an as needed basis 
therefore  they may  at any time refuse to promote our products discontinue the use of our products in favor of a competitor product also  with a distribution channel standing between us and the actual end user  we may not be able to accurately gauge current demand and anticipate future demand for our products 
for example  retailers  dealers and pc manufacturers may place large initial orders for a new product just to keep their stores and products stocked with the newest tv tuners and not because there is a significant demand for them 
we operate in a highly competitive market  and many of our competitors have much greater resources  which may make it difficult for us to remain competitive 
our business is subject to significant competition 
competition exists from larger companies that possess substantially greater technical  financial  human  sales and marketing resources than we do 
the dynamics of competition in this market involve short product life cycles  declining selling prices  evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions 
we compete against companies such as tivo inc and ati technologies inc  a division of advanced micro devices  inc  and a number of asian and european companies 
our internet based video technology products compete in the consumer electronics market  where competition comes from sony corporation  toshiba corporation  cisco systems  inc  sling media inc 
and others 
we believe that competition from new entrants will increase as the market for digital video in a pc expands 
there can be no assurance that we will not experience increased competition in the future 
such increased competition may have a material adverse affect on our ability to successfully market our products 
competition is expected to remain intense and  as a result  we may lose some of our market share to our competitors 
further  we believe that the market for our products will continue to be price competitive and thus we could continue to experience lower selling prices  lower gross profit margins and reduced profitability levels for such products than in the past rapid technological changes and short product life cycles in our industry and the availability of new products  services and technologies could harm our business 
the technology underlying our products and other products in the computer industry  in general  is subject to rapid change  including the potential introduction of new types of products  services and technologies  which may have a material adverse impact upon our business  operating results and financial condition 
the pervasive availability of new products  services including internet services and technologies may have a material adverse impact upon our business  operating results and financial condition 
we will need to maintain an ongoing research and development program  and our potential future success  of which there can be no assurances  will depend  in part  on our ability to respond quickly to technological advances by developing and introducing new products  successfully incorporating such advances in existing products  and obtaining licenses  patents  or other proprietary technologies to be used in connection with new or existing products 
we expended approximately  and  for research and development expenses for the fiscal years ended september  and  respectively 
there can be no assurance that our research and development will be successful or that we will be able to foresee and respond to such advances in technological developments and to successfully develop additional products 
additionally  there can be no assurances that the development of technologies  services or products by competitors will not render our products or technologies non competitive or obsolete 
if tv or video capabilities are included in pcs or in operating systems  it could result in a reduction in the demand for add on tv and video devices 
although we believe that our software is a competitive strength  as operating systems such as windows move to integrate and standardize software support for video capabilities  we will be challenged to further differentiate our products 
our operating results and ability to retain our market share are also dependent on continued growth in the underlying markets for pc  tv and video products 
we may not be able to timely adopt emerging industry standards  which may make our products unacceptable to potential customers  delay our product introductions or increase our costs 
our products must comply with a number of current industry standards and practices established by various international bodies 
failure to comply with evolving standards  including video compression standards  tv transmission standards  and pc interface standards  will limit acceptance of our products by the market 
if new standards are adopted in the industry  we will be required to adopt those standards in our products 
it may take a significant amount of time to develop and design products incorporating these new standards  and we may not succeed in doing so 
we may also become dependent upon products developed by third parties and have to pay royalty fees  which may be substantial  to the developers of the technology that constitutes the newly adopted standards 
we are substantially dependent upon foreign markets for sales of our products  primarily the european market  and adverse changes in these markets could reduce our sales 
our future performance will likely be dependent  in large part  on our ability to continue to compete successfully in the european markets  where a large portion of our current and potential customers are located 
our ability to compete in these markets will depend on many factors  including the economic conditions in these regions the value of the euro versus the us dollar the stability of the political environment in these regions adverse changes in the relationships between major countries in these regions the state of trade relations among these regions and the united states restrictions on trade in these regions the imposition or changing of tariffs by the countries in these regions on products of the type that we sell changes in the regulatory environment in these regions export restrictions and export license requirements restrictions on the export of critical technology our ability to develop products that meet the varied technical requirements of customers in each of these regions our ability to maintain satisfactory relationships with our foreign customers and distributors changes in freight rates our ability to enforce agreements and other rights in the countries in these regions difficulties in staffing and managing international operations difficulties assessing new and existing international markets and credit risks potential insolvency of international customers and difficulty in collecting accounts if we are unable to address any of these factors  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we are heavily dependent upon foreign manufacturing facilities for our products  primarily facilities in asia  which exposes us to additional risks 
the majority of our products are built at contract manufacturing facilities in asia 
our ability to successfully build products at overseas locations will depend on many factors  including the economic conditions in these regions the acceptance of the us dollar as the currency to purchase manufactured products the stability of the political environment in these regions adverse changes in the relationships between major countries in these regions the state of trade relations among these regions and the united states restrictions on trade in these regions the imposition or changing of tariffs by the countries in these regions on products of the type that we sell changes in the regulatory environment in these regions import restrictions and import license requirements our ability to maintain satisfactory relationships with our foreign manufacturers changes in freight rates difficulties in staffing and managing international operations potential insolvency of vendors and difficulty in obtaining materials if we are unable to address any of these factors  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
foreign currency exchange fluctuations could adversely affect our results 
for the two fiscal years ended september  and  at least of our sales were generated by our european subsidiary and were invoiced and collected in local currency  which was primarily the euro 
on the supply side  since we predominantly deal with north american and asian suppliers and contract manufacturers  approximately of our inventory required to support our european sales are purchased and paid in us dollars 
the combination of sales billed in euros supported by inventory purchased in us dollars results in an absence of a natural local currency hedge 
consequently  our financial results are subject to market risks resulting from the fluctuations in the euro to us dollar exchange rates 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we may be unable to develop new products that meet customer requirements in a timely manner 
our success is dependent on our ability to continue to introduce new products with advanced features  functionality and performance that our customers demand 
we may not be able to introduce new products on a timely basis  that are accepted by the market  and that sell in quantities sufficient to make the products viable for the long term 
sales of new products may negatively impact sales of existing products 
in addition  we may have difficulty establishing our products presence in markets where they do not currently have significant brand recognition 
we may experience volatile gross profit margins 
over the last two fiscal years our gross profit margins have ranged from a low of to a high of due to the following factors  among others sales mix of lower margin products changes in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily the euro allowances for excess inventory increases in costs charged by contract manufacturers increases in duty and tariff rates increases in shipping costs lower average selling prices increases in material acquisition costs and different gross margins for like products in different markets as margins may decline  our profitability will be more dependent upon effective cost management controls 
there can be no assurances that such cost and management controls can be implemented and maintained  and if implemented  that they will be successful 
we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  downward pricing pressure on our products  which could substantially impair our operating performance 
we are experiencing  and are likely to continue to experience  downward pricing pressure on our products 
as a result  we have experienced  and we expect to continue to experience  declining average sales prices for our products 
increases in the number of units that we are able to sell and reductions in per unit costs may not occur  and if they occur  they may not be sufficient to offset reductions in per unit sales prices  in which case our net income would be reduced and we could incur losses 
since we typically negotiate supply arrangements far in advance of delivery dates  we may need to commit to price reductions for our products before we are aware of how  or if  these cost reductions can be obtained 
as a result  any current or future price reduction commitments and our inability to respond to increased price competition could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our cost reduction and operational efficiency programs may not achieve the intended results changing economic and business conditions may dictate that we undertake a plan of cost and operational efficiency reductions 
we cannot be certain that these programs will achieve their intended results 
additionally  these programs may be misplaced or insufficient for purposes of positioning us for future growth  in which case our long term competitive position may suffer 
failure of these programs  if any  could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we are dependent upon contract manufacturers for our production 
if these manufacturers do not meet our requirements  either in volume or quality  then we could be materially harmed 
during fiscal  we subcontracted the manufacturing and assembly of our products to six independent third parties at facilities in various asian countries 
relying on subcontractors involves a number of significant risks  including loss of control over the manufacturing process potential absence of adequate production capacity potential delays in production lead times unavailability of certain process technologies reduced control over delivery schedules  manufacturing yields  quality and costs  and unexpected increases in component costs we may need to hold more inventory than is immediately required to compensate for potential manufacturing disruptions 
if our significant subcontractors become unable or unwilling to continue to manufacture these products in required volumes  we will have to identify qualified alternate subcontractors 
additional qualified subcontractors may not be available  or may not be available on a timely or cost competitive basis 
any interruption in the supply of  or increase in the cost of  the products manufactured by third party subcontractors could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we are dependent upon single or limited source suppliers for our components and assembled products 
if these suppliers do not meet the demand  either in volume or quality  then we could be materially harmed 
if the supply of a key component or assembled product  such as the hd pvr or a pctv product  were to be delayed or curtailed  or in the event a key manufacturing or sole vendor delays shipment of such components or completed products  our ability to ship products in desired quantities and in a timely manner would be adversely affected 
our business  operating results and financial condition could also be adversely affected  depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source or  if possible  to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source 
we attempt to mitigate these potential risks by working closely with our key suppliers on product introduction plans  strategic inventories  coordinated product introductions  and internal and external manufacturing schedules and levels 
we are also seeking out alternative sources for assembled products  making us less dependent on a single or limited source 
we may need to hold more inventory than is immediately required to compensate for potential component shortages or discontinuation 
this could lead to an increase in the costs of manufacturing or assembling our products 
if any single or limited source supplier becomes unable or unwilling to continue to supply these components or assembled products in required volumes  we will have to identify and qualify acceptable replacements or redesign our products with different components 
additional sources may not be available  or product redesign may not be feasible on a timely basis 
any interruption in the supply of or increase in the cost of the components and assembled products provided by single or limited source suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may incur excessive expenses if we are unable to accurately forecast sales of our products 
we generally ship products within one to four weeks after receipt of orders 
therefore  our sales backlog is typically minimal 
accordingly  our expectations of future net sales and our product manufacturing and materials planning are based largely on our own estimates of future demand and not on firm customer orders 
if we obtain orders in excess of our internal forecasts  we may be unable to timely increase production to meet demand  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
if our net sales do not meet expectations  our business  operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected  we may be burdened with excess inventory  and we may be subject to excess costs or inventory write offs 
we may experience a reduction in sales if we are unable to respond quickly to changes in the market for our products 
our net sales can be affected by changes in the quantity of products that our retail  distributor and pc manufacturer customers maintain in their inventories 
we may be directly and rapidly affected by changes in the market  including the impact of any slowdown or rapid increase in end user demand 
despite efforts to reduce distribution channel inventory exposure  retailers  distribution partners and pc manufacturer customers may still choose to alter their inventory levels  which could cause a reduction in our net sales  this could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may accumulate inventory to minimize the impact of shortages from manufacturers and suppliers  which may result in obsolete inventory that we may need to write off resulting in losses 
managing our inventory is complicated by fluctuations in the demand for our products as well as the issues of using contract manufacturers and procuring components from suppliers mentioned above 
as we must plan to have sufficient quantities of products available to satisfy our customers demands  we sometimes accumulate inventory for a period of time to minimize the impact of possible insufficient capacity or availability of components from our manufacturers and suppliers 
although we expect to sell the inventory within a short period of time  products may remain in inventory for extended periods of time and may become obsolete because of the passage of time and the introduction of new products or new components within existing products 
in these situations  we would be required to write off obsolete inventory which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may need financing  and may not be able to raise financing on favorable terms  if at all  which could increase our costs and limit our ability to grow and operate 
we anticipate that we may need to raise additional capital in the future to continue our long term expansion plans  to respond to competitive pressures or to respond to unanticipated requirements 
we currently do not have a working capital line of credit in place 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain financing on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
our failure or inability to obtain financing on acceptable terms could require us to limit our plans for expansion  incur indebtedness that has high rates of interest or substantial restrictive covenants  issue equity securities that will dilute existing stockholders holdings or discontinue a portion of our operations  each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may become involved in costly intellectual property disputes 
with the proliferation of new products and rapidly changing technology  there is a significant volume of patents and other intellectual property rights held by third parties 
there are a number of companies that hold patents for various aspects of the technologies incorporated in some of the pc and tv industries standards 
given the nature of our products and development efforts  there are risks that claims associated with such patents or intellectual property rights could be asserted by third parties against us 
we expect that parties seeking to gain competitive advantages will increase their efforts to enforce any patent or intellectual property rights that they may have 
the holders of patents from which we may have not obtained licenses may take the position that it is required to obtain a license from them 
if a patent holder refuses to offer such a license or offers such a license on terms unacceptable to us  there is a risk of incurring substantial litigation or settlement costs regardless of the merits of the allegations  or which party eventually prevails 
if we do not prevail in a litigation suit  we may be required to pay significant damages and or to cease sales and production of infringing products and accordingly  may incur significant defense costs 
additionally  we may need to attempt to design around a given technology  although there can be no assurances that this would be possible or economical 
we currently use technology licensed from third parties in certain products 
our business  financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected by a number of factors relating to these third party technologies  including failure by a licensor to accurately develop  timely introduce  promote or support the technology delays in shipment of products excess customer support or product return costs due to problems with licensed technology termination of our relationship with such licensors we may be unable to enforce our intellectual property rights 
we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property through patent  copyright  trademark and other means of protection 
if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property  our intellectual property rights may be misappropriated by others  invalidated or challenged  and our competitors could duplicate our technology or may otherwise limit any competitive technological advantage we may have 
due to the rapid pace of technological change  we believe our success is likely to depend more upon continued innovation  technical expertise  marketing skills and customer support and service rather than upon legal protection of our proprietary rights 
however  we intend to aggressively assert our intellectual property rights when necessary 
even though we typically develop our products independently  our success  of which there can be no assurances  will depend  in a large part  on our ability to innovate  obtain or license patents  protect trade secrets  copyrights and trademarks  and draw upon our proprietary technology without infringing on the proprietary rights of others 
we maintain copyrights on our designs and software programs  but currently we have no patent on the wintv board as we believe that such technology cannot be patented 
we have no patents issued or pending that relate to our technology 
we are subject to a number of risks relating to intellectual property rights  including the following the means by which we seek to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to prevent others from misappropriating our technology or from independently developing or selling technology or products with features based on or similar to our products our products may be sold in foreign countries that provide less protection to intellectual property than is provided under us laws our intellectual property rights may be challenged  invalidated  violated or circumvented and may not provide us with any competitive advantage we may not be able to attract and retain qualified managerial and other skilled personnel 
our success  of which there can be no assurances  depends  in part  on our ability to identify  attract  motivate and retain qualified managerial  technical and sales personnel 
our success  of which there can be no assurances  is dependent on our ability to manage effectively the enhancement and introduction of existing and new products and the marketing of such products 
we are particularly dependent on our ability to identify  attract  motivate and retain qualified managers  engineers and salespersons 
the loss of the services of a significant number of engineers or sales people or one or more senior officers or managers could be disruptive to product development efforts or business relationships and could seriously harm our business 
we depend on a limited number of key personnel  and the loss of any of their services could adversely affect our future growth and profitability and could substantially interfere with our operations 
our products are complex and our market is evolving 
the success of our business depends in large part upon the continuing contributions of our management and technical personnel 
the loss of the services of any of our key officers or employees could adversely affect our future growth and profitability and could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our dependence upon our key officers and employees is increased by the fact that they are responsible for our sales and marketing efforts as well as our overall operations 
we do not have key person life insurance policies covering any of our employees other than mr 
plotkin  our president  chairman of the board  chief executive officer and chief operating officer 
the insurance coverage that we have on him may be insufficient to compensate us for the loss of his services 
our products could contain defects  which could result in delays in recognition of sales  loss of sales  loss of market share  or failure to achieve market acceptance  or claims against us 
we develop complex products for tv and video processing 
despite testing by our engineers  subcontractors and customers  errors may be found in existing or future products 
this could result in  among other things  a delay in recognition of sales  loss of sales  loss of market share  failure to achieve market acceptance or substantial damage to our reputation 
we could be subject to material claims by customers  and may need to incur substantial expenses to correct any product defects 
we do not have product liability insurance to protect against losses caused by defects in our products  and we also do not have errors and omissions insurance 
as a result  any payments that we may need to make to satisfy our customers may be substantial and may result in a substantial charge to earnings 
we may experience fluctuations in our future operating results  which will make predicting our future results difficult 
historically  our quarterly and annual operating results have varied significantly from period to period  and we expect that our results will continue to do so 
these fluctuations result from a variety of factors  including market acceptance of our products changes in order flow from our customers  and their inability to forecast their needs accurately the timing of our new product announcements and of announcements by our competitors increased competition  including changes in pricing by us and our competitors delays in deliveries from our limited number of suppliers and subcontractors difficulty in implementing effective cost management constraints market and economic conditions as our sales are primarily to the consumer market  we have experienced certain seasonal revenue trends 
our peak sales quarter  due to holiday season sales of computer equipment  is typically our first fiscal quarter october to december  followed by our second fiscal quarter january to march 
in addition  our international sales  mostly in the european market  were and of sales for the fiscal years ended september  and  respectively 
our fiscal fourth quarter sales july to september can be potentially impacted by the reduction of activity experienced in europe during the july and august summer holiday period 
accordingly  any sales or net income in any particular period may be lower than the sales and net income in a preceding or comparable period 
period to period comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful  and should not be relied upon as indications of our future performance 
in addition  our operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors in future periods 
failure to meet such expectations  should such an event occur  will likely cause our share price to decline 
our common stock price is highly volatile 
the market price of our common stock has been  and may continue to be  subject to a high degree of volatility 
numerous factors may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock  including general conditions in the pc and tv industries product pricing new product introductions market growth forecasts technological innovations mergers and acquisitions announcements of quarterly operating results overall us and international economic and market conditions and economic health stability of the us and international securities markets in addition  stock markets have experienced extreme price volatility and broad market fluctuations in recent years 
this volatility has had a substantial effect on the market price of securities issued by many high technology companies in many cases for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
the price of our common stock has experienced volatility not necessarily related to our performance 
we may not be able to maintain compliance with the requirements for continued listing under the nasdaq listing rules or we may not be able to maintain our nasdaq listing 
on october   nasdaq notified us that we were subject to delisting based on our failure to timely hold our annual stockholders meeting 
on december   we held our annual stockholders meeting and on december   a nasdaq hearings panel rendered its determination to continue our listing 
on november   we received a notice from nasdaq indicating that we were not in compliance with the minimum closing bid price requirement for continued listing on the nasdaq global market  as set forth in nasdaq listing rule a the rule 
in accordance with nasdaq rule c a  we were provided calendar days  or until may   to regain compliance with the minimum closing bid price requirement 
on may   we received written notification the may notice from nasdaq that we had regained compliance with the minimum closing bid price requirement 
the may notice stated that  as a result of the our having satisfied the per share minimum closing bid price requirement for the ten consecutive business days ending on may   we had regained compliance with the rule and that this matter was now closed 
on january  we received a letter from nasdaq indicating that we were not in compliance with the minimum stockholders equity requirement for continued listing on the nasdaq global market as set forth in nasdaq listing rule b a because our stockholders equity was below the nasdaq global market minimum stockholders equity listing requirement of  the nasdaq letter also indicated that we did not meet the continued listing requirements for the nasdaq global market under its alternative standards 
subsequent to our receipt of the nasdaq letter  we sent a letter to nasdaq describing our plan to regain compliance with the minimum stockholders equity requirement for continued listing on the nasdaq global market 
the plan was not accepted by nasdaq 
we subsequently applied to transfer the listing of our common stock from the nasdaq global market to the nasdaq capital market in order to conform to nasdaq s continued listing requirements 
on february   we received a letter from the nasdaq stock market notifying us that nasdaq had approved our application to list our common stock on the nasdaq capital market 
the nasdaq letter stated that the listing of our common stock would be transferred to the nasdaq capital market from the nasdaq global market at the opening of business on thursday  march  no assurances can be provided that we will be able to achieve or maintain compliance with the requirements for continued listing under the nasdaq listing rules including with respect to  among others things  minimum bid price and stockholders equity or that we will maintain our nasdaq listing 
we may not be able to maintain our listing on the nasdaq capital market 
our common stock trades on the nasdaq capital market under the symbol haup 
prior to march  our common stock traded on the nasdaq global market 
if we fail to meet the continued listing standards of the nasdaq capital market  our common stock could be delisted from the nasdaq captial market 
if our securities are delisted by nasdaq  then the market liquidity for such securities would likely be negatively affected  which may make it more difficult for holders to sell such securities in the open market  and we could face additional difficulty raising capital necessary for our continued operation 
investors may find it more difficult to dispose of or obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of our securities 
our amended and restated by laws may have anti takeover effects  limiting the ability of outside stockholders to seek control of management  and any premium over market price that an acquirer might otherwise pay may be reduced and any merger or takeover may be delayed 
effective august   the board of directors unanimously approved amended and restated by laws for us the by laws 
the by laws do not permit stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders and consequently  an expensive proxy contest cannot occur other than in connection with the annual meeting of stockholders 
the by laws also impose strict requirements for shareholder proposals and nominations of prospective board members other than those nominated by or at the discretion of the board of directors 
these amendments may collectively or individually impact a person s decision to purchase voting securities in our company and may have anti takeover effects in that any merger or takeover may be delayed 
accordingly  any premium over market price that an acquirer might otherwise pay may be reduced 
we have paid no dividends and none are anticipated 
we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not contemplate or anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
it is currently anticipated that earnings  if any  will be used to finance the development and expansion of the business 
in addition  the note contains restrictions on the payment of dividends  among other things 
we may not be able to effectively integrate businesses or assets that we acquire 
we may identify and pursue acquisitions of complementary companies and strategic assets  such as customer bases  products and technology 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities 
if any such opportunity involves the acquisition of a business  we cannot be certain that we will successfully integrate the operations of the acquired business with our own all the benefits expected from such integration will be realized management attention will not be diverted or divided  to the detriment of current operations amortization of acquired intangible assets will not have a negative effect on operating results or other aspects of our business delays or unexpected costs related to the acquisition will not have a detrimental effect on our business  operating results and financial condition customer dissatisfaction with  or performance problems at  an acquired company will not have an adverse effect on our reputation respective operations  management and personnel will be compatible 
in most cases  acquisitions will be consummated without seeking and obtaining stockholder approval  in which case stockholders will not have an opportunity to consider and vote upon the merits of such an acquisition 
although we will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular acquisition  there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess such risks 
we have a history of operating losses and there can be no assurance that we will be profitable in the future 
we incurred losses from continuing operations for the last four fiscal years 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal we put into place an expense reduction plan 
while we believe that with the proper execution of our business and operating plan  our cash and cash equivalents as of september  and our internally generated cash will provide us with sufficient liquidity to meet our capital needs for the next twelve months  we must ultimately remain profitable or obtain financing to be able to meet our future cash flow requirements  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
inflation could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition while inflation has not had a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition in the past  in the event that the inflation rate increases  there can be no assurance that we will be able to offset the effects of inflation through price increases to our customers  without experiencing a reduction in the demand for our products  or that inflation will not have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition

seasonal nature of sales 
pgjpg 
there is a seasonal pattern to our quarterly sales 
listed below are the primary causes of our seasonal sales we primarily sell through a sales channel which consists of retailers  pc manufacturers and distributors 
spurred on by holiday spending  our sales during our first fiscal quarter  which encompasses the holiday season  have historically been the highest of our fiscal year 
we typically experience a slowdown during the summer holiday period in europe starting with the second half of our fiscal third quarter and into the first half of our fiscal fourth quarter 
we also experience decreased sales during the summer holiday period in the us this has historically caused sales for the last six months of our fiscal year to be lower than the first six months of our fiscal year 
our sales for the first six months of fiscal and fiscal accounted for approximately and of sales  respectively  and our sales for the last six months of fiscal and accounted for approximately and of sales  respectively 
although our strategy has been to diversify our sales to minimize the seasonal nature of our business  we anticipate similar seasonal trends for the near term future

an increase in the average euro to usd rate from for fiscal to for fiscal resulted in an increase in gross profit percentage of for fiscal over fiscal changes during fiscal in accrued expense fees due to changes in estimates resulted in a gross profit percentage increase of for fiscal from fiscal changes during fiscal in accrued expense fees due to settlements and changes in estimates resulted in a gross profit percentage decrease of for fiscal from fiscal changes during fiscal in accrued expense fees due to correction of error related to prior periods resulted in a gross profit percentage decrease of for fiscal from fiscal volatility of gross profit percentage 
pgjpg 
excluding changes in the gross profit during fiscal related to accrued expense fee adjustments due to settlements and changes in estimates  over the eight quarters of fiscal and fiscal  the gross profit percentage has ranged from a low of to a high of listed below are factors which contribute to the volatility of our gross profit percentage 
gross profit percentages vary within our retail family of products as well as for products sold to computer manufacturers 
changes in the product line sales mix affect the gross profit percentage 
changes in the euro to us dollar exchange rate impact gross profit 
an increase in the euro tends to increase our gross profit percentage  while a decrease in the euro tends to decrease our gross profit percentage 
included in cost of sales are certain fixed and semi fixed costs  mainly for production labor  warehouse labor and the overhead costs of our ireland distribution facility 
when unit and dollar sales decline due to seasonal sales trends  these fixed costs get spread over lower unit and dollar sales  resulting in increased unit costs and increased fixed and semi fixed costs as a percentage of sales  which lowers the gross profit percentage 
our market is constantly changing with new competitors joining our established competitors 
these competitive pressures from time to time result in a lowering of our average sales prices to meet our competitors prices  which tends to reduce the gross profit and gross profit percentage 
the supply and demand for component parts affect the gross profit percentage 
when component parts are in short supply we may be subject to price increases 
conversely  when component parts supply is high we may be able to secure price decreases 
as unit sales volume increases we have more leverage in negotiating volume price reductions with our component suppliers and our contract manufacturers 
pricing from our suppliers and our contract manufacturers and are continually reviewed as we seek to achieve cost reductions from our component part suppliers and contract manufacturers 
our mix of sales impact our obligation to pay certain licensing costs 
increases in fuel costs are reflected in the amounts we pay for the delivery of product from our suppliers and the amounts we pay for deliveries to our customers 
rising fuel prices increase our freight costs and negatively impact our gross profit 
managing product mix through market strategy and new products  moderating seasonal trends  efficiently managing shipments and achieving cost reductions are a company priority and are critical to our competitive position in the market 
although our goal is to optimize gross profit and minimize gross profit fluctuations  in light of the dynamics of our market we anticipate the continuance of gross profit percentage fluctuations 
selling  general and administrative expenses the chart below illustrates the components of selling  general and administrative expenses 
twelve months ended september  dollar amounts percentage of sales increase decrease increase sales marketing hcw sales marketing pctv technical support general administrative hcw general administrative pctv amortization of intangible assets selling  general and administrative stock compensation expense severance charges total selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense for the fiscal year ended september  decreased  from fiscal as follows sales and marketing expenses decreased  driven primarily by  in lower compensation expenses   in lower sales related expenses  due to lower commission and co op advertising  lower sales office expenses of  due to a decrease in personnel and an increase in expenses of  due to the stronger euro 
the decrease in technical support of  was primarily due to lower personnel expenses 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses of  was due primarily to lower professional fees of  due to lower legal and consulting fees  lower pctv general and administrative expenses of  mainly for termination of service related contracts and lower professional fees   in lower bad debt expense and  in lower financing fees due to premiums for foreign exchange option contracts paid during fiscal for which no similar option contracts were entered into during fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal we put into place an expense reduction plan 
pursuant to this plan we incurred severance and termination costs of  selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of sales 
pgjpg 
due to fixed costs which fluctuate minimally with changes in sales  coupled with the seasonal nature of our business  selling general and administrative expense as a percentage of sales are sensitive to seasonal sales fluctuations 
over the eight quarters of fiscal and fiscal  selling general and administrative expense excluding severance charges booked in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a percentage of sales has resulted in the following trends with our first quarter usually yielding the highest quarterly sales levels of the fiscal year  selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of sales have typically been the lowest of the fiscal year 
as reflected in the chart  selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of sales was the lowest in the first quarter of fiscal and reflecting the seasonal trend in sales  selling  general and administrative expense for the third or fourth quarter are the highest as a percentage of sales 
total selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of sales were the highest in the fourth quarter of fiscal and third quarter of fiscal reflecting the decline in sales  total selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales were higher for fiscal compared to fiscal with the expectation that the seasonal nature of sales will continue for the near future  we expect selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales to reflect a future trend that is similar to the historical trends we have experienced over the prior two fiscal years 
research and development expense research and development expenses for the fiscal year ended september  decreased  compared to the fiscal year ended september  the decrease was due to  in lower compensation expenses   in lower development expenses due to reimbursements from development partners plus the volume and timing of development programs  and an increase in expenses of  due to the stronger euro 
other income other income for the fiscal year ended september  was  compared to other income of  for the fiscal year ended september  as detailed below twelve months ended september  interest income interest expense foreign currency transaction gains total other income during fiscal  we had forward exchange contracts which we sold at a profit 
tax provision our net tax provision for the fiscal years ended september  and is as follows twelve months ended september  deferred tax expense foreign income tax state income tax net tax provision our net deferred tax asset is primarily attributable to our hauppauge computer works inc domestic operations and consists primarily of timing differences 
in evaluating the future realization of our deferred tax asset and the corresponding valuation allowance as of september   we took into consideration our domestic operations had taxable income in two of the last five fiscal years  and would have had taxable income in the current year if we did not dispose of inventory that we were able to take a tax benefit for  a three year forecast that included the impact of new products recently released as well as an expense reduction plan that the company put into effect  which supports the utilization of our current net operating losses and a portion of our current timing differences included in our deferred tax assets  our history of utilization of prior domestic net operating losses after evaluating the circumstances listed above  it was our opinion that its net deferred tax asset of  is realizable as of september  as a result of all of the above items mentioned in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we had incurred a net loss of  for the fiscal year ended september   which resulted in basic and diluted net loss per share of on weighted average basic and diluted shares of  compared to a net loss of  for the fiscal year ended september   which resulted in basic and diluted net loss per share of on weighted average basic and diluted shares of options to purchase  and  shares of common stock at prices ranging to and to  respectively  were outstanding as of september  and  respectively  but were not included in the computation of diluted net income per share of common stock because they were anti dilutive 
liquidity and capital resources we had cash and cash equivalents as of september  of  a decrease of  from september  the decrease in cash was due to operating investing financing activities activities activities total sources of cash decrease in accounts receivable decrease in inventory proceeds from employee stock purchases total sources of cash less cash used for net loss adjusted for non cash items decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses capital equipment purchases increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets total usage of cash effect of exchange rates on cash net cash decrease the net cash decrease due to operating activities was  the decrease was due to  of net loss adjusted for non cash items  a decrease in accounts payable and accrues expenses of  and an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of  somewhat offsetting these cash decreases were decreases in accounts receivable and inventory of  and  respectively 
the decrease in accounts receivable was due to collections and lower fiscal fourth quarter sales 
the decrease in inventory was due to reduced production related to the lower sales 
cash of  was used in investing activities for the purchase of fixed assets 
cash of  from financing activities came from exercise of incentive stock options 
the effect of changes in exchange rates provided an  increase in cash 
we had a working capital deficit of  as of september  and working capital of  as of september  a net reduction in current assets of  reflective of lower business volume and the net loss for the year were the primary drivers of the reduction in working capital 
our cash requirements for the next twelve months will include  among other things  the cash needed to fund our operating and working capital needs 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal we put into place an expense reduction plan 
with the proper execution of this plan and our business and operating plan  we believe that our cash and cash equivalents as of september  and our internally generated cash will provide us with sufficient liquidity to meet our capital needs for the next twelve months 
failure to meet the business and operating plan could require the need for additional sources of capital 
in light of the current economic and credit conditions there can be no assurances that we will be able to find external sources of financing to fund our additional capital needs 
in addition  if we are able to obtain financing  there can be no assurances that it will be on financially reasonable terms 
we do not currently have a bank line of credit in place 
on november   we approved a stock repurchase program 
the program authorized us to repurchase up to  shares of our own stock 
the stock repurchase program was extended by a resolution of our board of directors on december  at our august  board meeting  our board of directors approved an increase in the number of shares which can be repurchased under the plan to  as of september  and  we held  treasury shares purchased for  at an average purchase price of sources and usage of cash components the chart below shows our cash balances  sources of cash and usage of cash by quarter for fiscal through fiscal 
pgjpg 
sources and usage of cash primarily comes from the items listed below net loss adjusted for non cash items changes in the levels of current assets and current liabilities  primarily accounts receivable  inventories and accounts payable purchase of capital equipment accounts receivable  inventory  accounts payable and accrued expenses make up the majority of our current asset and current liability levels 
our cash balances are affected by changes in these assets and liabilities 
in the quarters where cash was used to increase the current asset levels or decrease the current liability levels  there was usually a corresponding decrease or neutral position in the cash balances during those quarters 
conversely  in the quarters when we generated cash by reducing the current asset levels or increasing the current liability levels  there was a corresponding increase in the cash balances during those quarters 
we expect for the near term future that our operating structure will remain similar to past years  therefore our investment and subsequent changes in our current assets and current liabilities required to fund our operating cycles will continue to have a material impact on our cash generation  cash usage and cash balances 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal we put into place an expense reduction plan 
the strategy is to bring expenses into alignment with our sales 
the objective of this plan is to reduce and ultimately eliminate the operating losses and stop the reduction of cash related to the operating losses 
future contractual obligation the following table shows our contractual obligations related to lease obligations as of september  payments due by period total less than year years to years operating lease obligations inflation while inflation has not had a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition in the past  in the event that the inflation rate increases  there can be no assurance that we will be able to offset the effects of inflation through price increases to our customers  without experiencing a reduction in the demand for our products  or that inflation will not have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
critical accounting policies and estimates we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements revenue recognition management s estimates translation of assets and liabilities denominated in non functional currencies on our european financial statements inventory obsolescence and reserves accounts receivable related reserves intangible assets income taxes revenue recognition we sell through a sales channel which consists of retailers  pc manufacturers and distributors 
the majority of our customers are granted lines of credit 
the product is shipped on account with the majority of customers typically given to day payment terms 
those customers deemed as large credit risks either pay in advance or issue us a letter of credit 
we require the customer to submit a purchase order to us 
the price of the product and payment terms are fixed per the terms of the purchase order 
upon shipment of the order to the customer  the title to the goods is passed to the customer 
the customer is legally obligated to pay for the order within the payment terms stated on the customer s purchase order 
the obligation to insure the boards and the cost of any pilferage while in the customer s possession is the responsibility of the customer 
we sell analog  hybrid video recorders or digital computer boards that are stocked on the shelves of retailers and are subject to the normal consumer traffic that retail stores attract 
aside from normal store promotions such as advertisements in the store s circular  we have no further obligation to assist in the resale of the products 
we offer some of our customers a right of return 
our accounting complies with fasb asc sfas revenue recognition when right of return exists  as typically at the end of every quarter we  based on historical data  evaluate our sales reserve level based on the previous six months sales 
due to the seasonal nature of the business coupled with the changing economic environment  management exercises some judgment with regard to the historical data to arrive at the reserve 
we offer mail in rebates on certain products at certain times as we may determine 
the rebates are recorded as a reduction to sales 
we also participate in limited cooperative advertising programs with retailers and distributors and account for these in accordance with fasb asc eitf  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
management s estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts for revenues  cost of sales and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates estimates  including those related to sales provisions  as described above  income taxes  bad debts  inventory allowances  accrued licensing fees and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical data  when available  experience  and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the combined results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
translation of assets and liabilities denominated in non functional currencies on our european financial statements the functional currency of our european subsidiary is the euro 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to translate assets and liabilities denominated in a non functional currency  mainly us dollars  to euros on the books of our european subsidiary 
this process results in exchange gains and losses depending on the changes in the euro to us dollar exchange rate 
under the relevant accounting guidance  with the exception of inter company accounts which are considered long term in nature  we are obligated to include these gains and losses on our statement of operations  which we report in other income or expense under the caption foreign currency 
the extent of these gains and losses can fluctuate greatly from month to month depending on the change in the exchange rate  causing results to vary widely 
due to the past volatility of the euro  it is difficult to forecast the long term trend of these gains and losses 
inventory obsolescence and reserves the technology underlying our products and other products in the computer industry  in general  is subject to rapid change  including the potential introduction of new types of products and technologies 
due to this  we maintain a program in which we review on a regular basis our inventory forecasting  inventory purchasing and our inventory levels 
we review our inventory realization and inventory reserves on a quarterly basis 
accounts receivable and related reserves on a daily basis we credit approve all orders scheduled for shipment 
customers who are over their credit limit or who have invoices that are past their due date are typically placed on credit hold until the credit problem is resolved 
credit reviews are performed on new customers 
existing customers who request an increased credit line are subject to a new credit review before increases in their credit line are approved 
our reserve for bad debt is done using a specific identification method 
on a quarterly basis we review the age and quality of our accounts receivable 
we reserve amounts due us from companies that have gone bankrupt or companies that we evaluate are near bankrupt 
our products are sold through sales channels which consist of retailers  pc manufacturers and distributors 
our products are primarily a retail product sold to end user consumers 
similar to other companies in the computer industry  our products are subject to returns by the end user 
in recognition that product may be returned at a later date  at the end of every quarter  based on historical data  we evaluate our sales reserve level based on the previous six months sales and we adjust our sales reserve as required 
intangible assets long lived assets include definite lived intangible assets 
definite lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows derived from such assets 
definite lived intangible assets primarily consist of covenant not to compete  customer relationships and technology 
when an impairment exists  the related assets are written down to fair value 
although we believe our judgments  estimates and or assumptions used in estimating cash flows and determining fair value are reasonable  making material changes to such judgments  estimates and or assumptions could materially affect such impairment analyses and our financial results 
income taxes we account for income taxes under an asset and liability approach  which recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are provided for if based upon the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized 
our deferred tax asset is primarily attributable to our hauppauge computer works inc domestic operations and consists primarily of timing differences 
as of september   we had  in net operating losses that expire between and the estimated tax benefit from the utilization of these net operating losses is  as of september   and is reflected as a component of our deferred tax asset 
in addition to the net operating losses we had  in inventory obsolescence reserves and  in bad debt reserves  with a combined deferred tax asset value of  based on management current estimate of book and taxable income attributable to our domestic operations for the next three years  it was determined that it is more likely than not that our domestic operations we will be able to generate enough taxable income in the respective carry forward periods and will utilize the respective net operating losses 
management s estimates considered the following during the latter part of fiscal we introduced new products that target the gaming market  the i pad and i phone market and the cable market  which we feel will enhance our sales stream during the latter part of fiscal we put into place an expense reduction plan  which is expected to reduce operating expenses by approximately million in fiscal based on a three year forecast with flat domestic sales for fiscal  and a increase in sales for fiscal and fiscal  our domestic operations  including the royalty fee from our european subsidiary  will have net income for fiscal  and during that period we are projecting that we will fully utilize all of our current net operating losses  and approximately of our current timing differences while we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  if we do not realize enough taxable income to fully utilize the net operating loss carry forwards  additional valuation allowances or tax provisions may be required 
the company recognizes the financial statement impact of tax provisions  taken or expected to be taken  utilizing a more likely than not recognition threshold 
we also recognize any interest and penalties related to tax uncertainties as income tax expense 
as of september   there are no unrecognized tax benefits  or related accrued interest and penalties  recorded in the financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued new guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income 
specifically  the new guidance allows an entity to present components of net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement  referred to as the statement of comprehensive income  or in two separate  but consecutive statements 
the new guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity 
while the new guidance changes the presentation of comprehensive income  there are no changes to the components that are recognized in net income or other comprehensive income under current accounting guidance 
we do not expect that the adoption of this disclosure only guidance will have an impact on our consolidated financial results and becomes effective during the second quarter of fiscal in may  the fasb issued amendments to fair value measurement and disclosure requirements 
this guidance amends united states generally accepted accounting principles us gaap to conform with measurement and disclosure requirements in international financial reporting standards ifrs 
the amendments change the wording used to describe the requirements in us gaap for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements 
this includes clarification of the board s intent about the application of existing fair value measurement and disclosure requirements and those that change a particular principle or requirement for measuring fair value or for disclosing information about fair value measurements 
in addition  to improve consistency in application across jurisdictions  some changes in wording are necessary to ensure that us gaap and ifrs fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are described in the same way for example  using the word shall rather than should to describe the requirements in us gaap 
this amended guidance is to be applied prospectively and becomes effective during the second quarter of fiscal we do not expect this guidance will have a material impact on results of operations or financial position
