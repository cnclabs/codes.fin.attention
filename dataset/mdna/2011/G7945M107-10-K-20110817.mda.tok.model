critical accounting estimates 
accounting estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results 
our company we are the world leading provider of hard disk drives based on revenue 
we design  manufacture  market and sell hard disk drives 
hard disk drives  commonly referred to as disk drives  hard drives or hdds  are devices that store digitally encoded data on rapidly rotating disks with magnetic surfaces 
the performance attributes of disk drives  including their cost effectiveness  high quality  high storage capacities and energy efficiencies have resulted in disk drives being used as the primary medium for mass storage of electronic data 
we produce a broad range of disk drive products addressing enterprise applications  where our products are designed for enterprise servers  mainframes and workstations  client compute applications  where our products are designed for desktop and notebook computers  and client non compute applications  where our products are designed for a wide variety of end user devices such as digital video recorders dvrs  personal data backup systems  portable external storage systems and digital media systems 
in addition to manufacturing and selling disk drives  we provide data storage services for small to medium sized businesses  including online backup  data protection and recovery solutions 
effective as of july   seagate technology public limited company  an irish public limited company  seagate ireland became the successor to seagate technology  an exempted company incorporated with limited liability under the laws of the cayman islands seagate cayman 
in connection with the reorganization  all issued and outstanding seagate cayman common shares were cancelled and ceased to exist  and seagate ireland issued ordinary shares on a one for one basis to the holders of seagate cayman common shares for each seagate cayman common share that was cancelled 
business overview our industry is characterized by several trends and factors that have a material impact on our strategic planning  financial condition and results of operations 
demand trends for disk drives 
the total available market tam for hard disk drives in the fiscal year was approximately million units  an increase of from the prior fiscal year 
the average capacity per drive shipped by the industry continued to increase and reached approximately gigabytes per unit in the last quarter of the fiscal year  which represents an increase of year over year 
overall storage demand increased approximately year over year 
we believe that continued growth in digital content requires increasingly higher storage capacity in order to store  aggregate  host  distribute  manage  back up and use such content  which we believe will continue to result in increased demand for disk drive products 
in addition  we believe the continued increased demand for disk drives  in developed countries as well as in emerging economies  reflects the demand for real time access to rich data and content driven by the impact of a highly mobile and increasingly connected user base 
we believe these trends will continue as computing architectures evolve to serve the growing commercial and consumer user base throughout the world 
historically  the electronic data storage industry has introduced alternative technologies that directly compete with hard disk drives 
ssds  using nand flash memory  are a potential alternative to disk drives in certain applications such as consumer handheld devices  tablets and portable external storage 
however  we believe that in the foreseeable future the traditional enterprise and client compute markets that require high capacity storage solutions  as well as the data intensive client non compute markets  will continue to 
table of contents be best served by hard disk drives based on the industry ability to deliver reliable  energy efficient and cost effective mass storage devices 
disk drives for enterprise storage 
we define enterprise storage as disk drives designed for mission critical applications and nearline applications 
mission critical applications are defined as applications that are vital to the operation of enterprises  requiring high performance  and high reliability disk drives 
we expect the market for mission critical enterprise storage solutions to continue to be driven by enterprises moving network traffic to dedicated storage area networks in an effort to reduce network complexity and increase energy savings 
we believe that this transition will lead to an increased demand for more energy efficient  smaller form factor disk drives 
these solutions are comprised principally of high performance enterprise class disk drives with sophisticated firmware and communications technologies 
nearline applications are defined as applications that are capacity intensive and require high capacity and energy efficient disk drives featuring lower costs per gigabyte 
we expect such applications  which include storage for cloud computing and backup services  will continue to grow and drive demand for disk drives designed with these attributes 
we believe the tam for enterprise disk drives for the fiscal year was approximately million units  an increase of compared to the prior fiscal year 
we believe that the increase in the tam from fiscal year was driven by enterprises moving network traffic to dedicated storage area networks in an effort to reduce network complexity and increase energy savings 
ssd storage applications have been introduced as a potential alternative to redundant system startup or boot disk drives 
in addition  enterprises are gradually adopting ssds in applications where rapid processing and or energy efficiency is required 
the timing of significant adoption of ssds is dependent on enterprises weighing the cost effectiveness and other benefits of mission critical enterprise disk drives against the perceived performance benefits of ssds 
disk drives for client compute 
we define client compute applications as disk drives designed for the traditional desktop and mobile compute applications 
we believe that the client compute tam for the fiscal year was approximately million units  a decrease of compared to prior fiscal year 
we believe that the increase in demand resulting from growing economies of certain countries and the continued proliferation of digital content will drive the demand for the client compute market 
disk drives for client non compute 
we define client non compute applications as disk drives designed for consumer electronic devices and disk drives used for external storage and network attached storage nas 
disk drives designed for consumer electronic devices are primarily used in applications such as dvrs that require a higher capacity  lower cost per gigabyte storage solution 
disk drives for external and nas devices are designed for purposes such as personal data backup and portable external storage  and to augment storage capacity in the consumer current desktop  notebook  tablet or dvr 
client non compute applications also include devices designed to display digital media in the home theater 
we believe the proliferation of high definition and media rich digital content will continue to create increasing consumer demand for higher storage solutions 
as the proliferation of non client compute applications that require minimal storage such as tablets continues  ssds could become more competitive within the client compute market in the future 
we believe the client non compute tam in the fiscal year was approximately million units  an increase of from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the strength of the retail market in asia pacific during most of the fiscal year 
industry supply balance from time to time the industry has experienced periods of imbalance between supply and demand 
to the extent that the disk drive industry builds capacity based on expectations of demand that do not 
table of contents materialize  price erosion may become more pronounced 
conversely  during periods where demand exceeds supply  price erosion is generally muted 
for the first half of fiscal year  our industry experienced a period of relative balance between supply and demand 
while we believe there was unmet demand in the last quarter of fiscal year due to a reaction to possible supply chain disruptions stemming from the earthquake and tsunami in japan  the industry returned to a relatively balanced supply environment at the end of the fiscal year 
suppliers of components and industry constraints due to industry consolidation  there are a limited number of independent suppliers of components  such as recording heads and media  available to disk drive manufacturers 
vertically integrated disk drive manufacturers  who manufacture their own components  are less dependent on external component suppliers than less vertically integrated disk drive manufacturers 
we believe the supply chain was generally tight for the industry during most of fiscal year commodity and other manufacturing costs the production of disk drives requires rare earth elements  precious metals  scarce alloys and other industrial commodities  which are subject to fluctuations in prices  and the supply of which has at times been constrained 
during the latter part of fiscal year  the industry experienced significant increases in the costs of rare earth elements  which are used in magnets as well as in the process for polishing glass substrates 
in addition to increased costs of components and commodities  volatility in fuel costs may also increase our costs related to commodities  manufacturing and freight 
as a result  we may increase our use of ocean shipments to help offset any increase in freight costs 
price erosion our industry has been characterized by price declines for disk drive products with comparable capacity  performance and feature sets like for like products 
price declines for like for like products price erosion are more pronounced during periods of economic contraction or industry consolidation in which competitors may use discounted pricing to attempt to maintain or gain market share  few new product introductions when multiple competitors have comparable or alternative product offerings  temporary imbalances between industry supply and demand  and seasonally weaker demand  which may cause excess supply 
disk drive manufacturers typically attempt to offset price erosion with an improved mix of disk drive products characterized by higher capacity  better performance and additional feature sets and or product cost reductions 
we expect price erosion in our industry to continue 
to remain competitive  we believe it is necessary for industry participants to continue to introduce new product offerings that utilize advanced technologies ahead of the competition in order to take advantage of potentially higher initial profit margins and reduced cost structures on these new products 
product life cycles and changing technology our industry has been characterized by significant advances in technology  which have contributed to rapid product life cycles 
as a result  success in our industry has been dependent to a large extent on the ability to be the first to market with new products  allowing those disk drive manufacturers who introduce new products first to benefit from improved mix  favorable profit margins and less pricing pressure until comparable products are introduced 
also  because our industry is characterized by continuous price 
table of contents erosion  the existence of rapid product life cycles has necessitated quick achievement of product cost effectiveness 
changing technology also necessitates on going investments in research and development  which may be difficult to recover due to rapid product life cycles and economic declines 
further  there is a continued need to successfully execute product transitions and new product introductions  as factors such as quality  reliability and manufacturing yields become of increasing competitive importance 
seasonality the disk drive industry traditionally experiences seasonal variability in demand with higher levels of demand in the second half of the calendar year 
this seasonality is driven by consumer spending in the back to school season from late summer to fall and the traditional holiday shopping season from fall to winter 
in addition  corporate demand is typically higher during the second half of the calendar year 
however  with volatility in fuel costs  the industry may be experiencing higher levels of demand earlier in the calendar year as customers attempt to take advantage of less expensive modes of transportation  which generally require longer lead times 
fiscal year summary revenues for fiscal year were billion which represented a decrease in revenues from billion in the prior fiscal year 
gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased to from in the prior fiscal year 
we shipped million units during fiscal year  which represents growth over the prior fiscal year 
the decline in revenue reflects the cumulative effect of the competitive pricing environment the industry experienced during the middle of calendar year  partially offset by an industry wide supply constraint experienced in the second half of fiscal year in what we believed to be a reaction to possible supply chain disruptions stemming from the earthquake and tsunami in japan 
the decline in gross margin reflects the effects of price erosion as well as the timing in which we were able to achieve increased manufacturing yields 
we generated operating cash flow of billion  used approximately million to repurchase million of our ordinary shares and used million for capital expenditures 
in  we issued billion in new long term debt and we repaid approximately million in existing long term debt 
pending transaction with samsung on april   we entered into an asset purchase agreement with samsung  a company organized under the laws of the republic of korea  pursuant to which we will acquire certain assets and assume certain liabilities of samsung relating to the research and development  manufacture and sale of hard disk drives 
under the terms of the agreement  samsung will receive consideration comprised of million in cash and approximately million of our ordinary shares 
the agreement has no financing contingencies  and is subject to customary closing conditions  including review by us and international regulators 
the agreement contains certain termination rights for samsung and provides that a specified fee must be paid by us to samsung in connection with certain termination events 
in certain specified circumstances  we must pay samsung a termination fee of million generally if the transaction has not been consummated and the requisite regulatory approvals have not been obtained by the expiration date of december   which may be extended in certain circumstances to march  
if regulatory approvals have been obtained but the transaction has not been consummated by the expiration date  then in certain specified circumstances we must pay samsung a termination fee of million generally if we are in breach of the agreement and legal remedies are not awarded to samsung 
on may   we received a request for additional information from the us federal trade commission the ftc in connection with the ftc review of the pending transaction 
on may   we received notification from the european commission the ec that the ec has decided to seek more information regarding the pending transaction 
we are in the process of gathering information to 
table of contents respond to both the ftc and the ec  however  we continue to believe the transaction will close by the end of calendar year results of operations the following table summarizes information from our consolidated statements of operations by dollars and as a percentage of revenue fiscal years ended dollars in millions july  july  july  revenue cost of revenue gross margin product development marketing and administrative amortization of intangibles restructuring and other  net impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets  net of recoveries income loss from operations other income expense  net income loss before income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes net income loss fiscal years ended as a percentage of revenue july  july  july  revenue cost of revenue gross margin product development marketing and administrative amortization of intangibles restructuring and other  net impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets  net of recoveries income loss from operations other income expense  net income loss before income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes net income loss

we maintain various sales programs such as point of sale rebates  sales price adjustments and price protection  aimed at increasing customer demand 
we exercise judgment in formulating the underlying estimates related to distributor and retail inventory levels  sales program participation and customer claims submittals in determining the provision for such programs 
sales programs recorded as contra revenue were approximately and of our gross revenue for fiscal years and  respectively 
gross margin fiscal years ended dollars in millions july  july  change change cost of revenue gross margin gross margin percentage 
table of contents for fiscal year  gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased to from in the prior fiscal year  primarily due to price erosion 
in addition  gross margin was negatively impacted by delays in ramping to maturity for new products  which unfavorably affected our manufacturing yields 
operating expenses fiscal years ended dollars in millions july  july  change change product development marketing and administrative amortization of intangibles restructuring and other  net impairment of long lived assets operating expenses product development expense 
product development expenses for fiscal year were relatively flat from fiscal year  reflecting a million decrease in variable performance based compensation  offset by an million increase in spending for new programs and an million decrease in research grants 
marketing and administrative expense 
the increase in marketing and administrative expenses for fiscal year compared to fiscal year was due to a million increase related to samsung acquisition expenses  million increase in litigation related expenses  and a net million reduction in total compensation expenses  part of which included a million decrease in variable performance based compensation 
amortization of intangibles 
amortization of intangibles for fiscal year decreased approximately from fiscal year as certain intangibles relating to the metalincs  inc acquisitions have been fully amortized 
restructuring and other  net 
during fiscal year  we recorded restructuring and other charges of million primarily associated with previously announced restructuring activities 
restructuring and other  net decreased approximately million when compared to the prior fiscal year  which included a million charge for our amk restructuring plan announced in august and an million charge related to our pittsburgh  pennsylvania facility 
impairment of long lived assets 
during fiscal year  we did not record any impairment charge related to our long lived assets 
impairment of long lived assets decreased approximately million when compared to the prior fiscal year  which included an impairment charge to adjust the carrying value of certain assets held for sale to their estimated fair value  less cost to sell 
other income expense  net fiscal years ended dollars in millions july  july  change change other expense  net 
table of contents the change in other expense  net for fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily due to a million increase in interest expense resulting from higher average debt balances and million in losses related to the redemption of debt 
income taxes fiscal years ended dollars in millions july  july  change change provision for benefit from income taxes we recorded an income tax provision of million for fiscal year compared to an income tax benefit of million for fiscal year our fiscal year provision for income taxes included non us income taxes recorded for increases in income tax reserves for non us income tax positions taken in prior fiscal years  partially offset by tax benefits recorded for the release of income tax reserves associated with settlements of income tax audits and the expiration of certain statutes of limitation 
our fiscal year income tax benefit included million of deferred tax benefit from the reversal of a portion of the us valuation allowance recorded in earlier years 
our irish tax resident parent holding company owns various us and non us subsidiaries that operate in multiple non irish tax jurisdictions 
our worldwide operating income is either subject to varying rates of tax or is exempt from tax due to tax holidays or tax incentive programs we operate under in malaysia  singapore  switzerland and thailand 
these tax holidays or incentives are scheduled to expire in whole or in part at various dates through our income tax provision recorded for fiscal year differed from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying the irish statutory rate of to income before income taxes primarily due to the net effect of i tax benefits related to non us earnings generated in jurisdictions that are subject to tax holidays or tax incentive programs and are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of ireland  ii income tax expense related to intercompany transactions  iii a decrease in valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets  and iv non us losses with no tax benefit 
our benefit for income taxes recorded for the comparative fiscal year ended july  differed from the provision benefit for income taxes that would be derived by applying the irish statutory rate of to income before income taxes primarily due to the net effect of i tax benefits related to non us earnings generated in jurisdictions that are subject to tax holidays or tax incentive programs and are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of ireland  ii a decrease in valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets  iii non us losses with no tax benefit  and iv tax expense related to intercompany transactions 
based on our non us ownership structure and subject to i potential future increases in our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets  and ii a future change in our intention to indefinitely reinvest earnings from our subsidiaries outside of ireland  we anticipate that our effective tax rate in future periods will generally be less than the irish statutory rate 
at july   our deferred tax asset valuation allowance was approximately billion 
at july   we had net deferred tax assets of million 
the realization of million of these deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on our ability to generate sufficient us and certain us taxable income in future periods 
although realization is not assured  we believe that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized 
the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable  however  may increase or decrease in subsequent periods when we re evaluate the underlying basis for our estimates of future us and certain us taxable income 
approximately million and million of our us net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards  respectively  are subject to an aggregate annual limitation of million pursuant to us tax law 

table of contents as of july  and july   we had approximately million and million  respectively  in unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties 
the unrecognized tax benefits that  if recognized  would impact the effective tax rate were million and million as of july  and july   respectively  subject to certain future valuation allowance reversals 
it is our policy to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for taxes on the consolidated statements of operations 
during fiscal year  we recognized a net expense for interest and penalties of less than million as compared to a net benefit of million and million during fiscal year and fiscal year  respectively 
as of july   we had million of accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits which remain unchanged from fiscal year during the fiscal year ended july   our unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties increased by approximately million primarily due to i reductions associated with the expiration of certain statutes of limitation of million  ii reductions associated with effectively settled positions of million  iii increases associated with the election to expense foreign tax credits of million  iv increases in current year unrecognized tax benefits of million v increases in prior year of unrecognized tax benefits of million  and vi increases from other activity  including non us exchange losses  of million 
during the months beginning july   we expect to reduce our unrecognized tax benefits by approximately million as a result of the expiration of certain statutes of limitation and resolution of issues with relevant authorities 
we do not believe it is reasonably possible that other unrecognized tax benefits will materially change in the next months 
we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions globally and are required to file us federal  us state  and non u 
s income tax returns 
in may  the us internal revenue service irs completed its field examination of our us federal income tax returns for fiscal years ending in through the irs issued a revenue agent report and proposed certain adjustments 
we are currently contesting certain of these proposed adjustments through the irs appeals office 
we believe that the resolution of these disputed issues will have no material impact on our financial statements 
with respect to us state and us income tax returns  we are generally no longer subject to tax examinations for years prior to fiscal year we are also no longer subject to tax examination of us federal income tax returns for years prior to fiscal year fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenue fiscal years ended dollars in millions july  july  change change revenue revenue in fiscal year increased approximately  or billion  from fiscal year primarily due to an increase in the total number of disk drives shipped 
this increase in revenue reflects an industry wide supply constraint experienced in the first half of fiscal year and a relatively balanced supply and demand environment during the march quarter resulting in muted price erosion 
in the june quarter  industry supply exceeded demand and resulted in an increase in price erosion to levels typical of a june quarter

product development expenses for fiscal year decreased approximately from fiscal year primarily due to restructuring and other cost reduction efforts  and the effect of an additional week of compensation expenses in fiscal year  which was a week fiscal year 
these cost reduction efforts resulted in decreases of million in headcount related expenses in fiscal year  million due to the cessation of certain product development activities  and million due to the non recurrence of accelerated depreciation expense related to the closure of our pittsburgh  pennsylvania facility 
these decreases were partially offset by increases of million for variable performance based compensation expense recorded in fiscal year compared to none in fiscal year  and a million benefit related to our deferred compensation plan recorded in fiscal year marketing and administrative expense 
marketing and administrative expenses for fiscal year decreased approximately from fiscal year primarily due to restructuring and other cost reduction efforts  and the effect of an additional week of compensation expenses in fiscal year  which was a week fiscal year

restructuring and other  net decreased approximately million in fiscal year when compared to the fiscal year  which include restructuring plans announced in january and may that were intended to realign our cost structure with the fiscal year macroeconomic business environment 
impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets  net of recoveries 
during fiscal year  we committed to a plan to sell certain equipment related to certain research activities that had ceased 
in connection with this plan  we reclassified these assets as held for sale and recorded a net impairment charge of approximately million to adjust the carrying value of these assets to the estimated fair value  less cost to sell 
impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets  net of recoveries decreased approximately billion in fiscal year when compared to the fiscal year due to non recurring billion impairment charge we recorded in fiscal year as a result of the significant adverse change to our business climate

the worker  homeownership  and business assistance act of  was enacted on november  this law allowed us to elect an increased carryback period for net operating losses incurred in or from two years to three  four or five years at our option 
we recorded an million income tax benefit as a result of the increased carryback period 
we recorded an income tax benefit of million for fiscal year compared to a provision for income taxes of million for fiscal year our fiscal year provision for income taxes included million of income tax expense recorded in the second quarter associated with an increase in our valuation allowance for us deferred tax assets related to a reduction in our forecasted us taxable income

our worldwide operating income is either subject to varying rates of tax or is exempt from tax due to tax holidays or tax incentive programs we operate under in china  malaysia  singapore  switzerland and thailand 
these tax holidays or incentives are scheduled to expire in whole or in part at various dates through since we became an irish tax resident in fiscal year  the irish statutory rate of is used for purposes of the reconciliation between the provision for income taxes at the statutory rate and our effective tax rate 
for fiscal years  a notional statutory rate was used 
our income tax benefit recorded for fiscal year differed from the provision benefit for income taxes that would be derived by applying the irish statutory rate of to income before income taxes primarily due to the net effect of i tax benefits related to non us earnings generated in jurisdictions that are subject to tax holidays or tax incentive programs and are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of ireland  ii a decrease in valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets  iii non us losses with no tax benefit  and iv tax expense related to intercompany transactions 
our provision for income taxes recorded for the comparative fiscal year ended july  differed from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying a notional us rate to income before income taxes primarily due to the net effect of i non deductible goodwill impairments  ii an increase in our valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets  iii non us losses with no tax benefit  iv tax benefits related to tax holiday and tax incentive programs  and v tax expense related to intercompany transactions 
liquidity and capital resources the following sections discuss our principal liquidity requirements  as well as our sources and uses of cash and our liquidity and capital resources 
our cash and cash equivalents are maintained in highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of days or less at the time of purchase 
our short term investments consist primarily of readily marketable debt securities with remaining maturities of more than days at the time of purchase 
the principal objectives of our investment policy are the preservation of principal and maintenance of liquidity 
we attempt to mitigate default risk by investing in high quality investment grade securities  limiting the time to maturity and by monitoring the counter parties and underlying obligors closely 
we monitor our investment portfolio and position our portfolio to respond appropriately to a reduction in credit rating of any investment issuer  guarantor or depository 
we intend to maintain a highly liquid portfolio by investing only in those marketable securities that we believe have active secondary or resale markets 
we believe our cash equivalents and short term investments are liquid and accessible 
we operate in some countries that may have restrictive regulations over the movement of cash and or foreign exchange across their borders 
these restrictions have not impeded our ability to conduct business in those countries  nor do we expect them to in the next months 
we are not aware of any downgrades  losses or other significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash equivalents or short term investments and accordingly  we do not believe the fair value of our short term investments has significantly changed from the values reported as of july  cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  and restricted cash and investments as of dollars in millions july  july  change cash and cash equivalents short term investments restricted cash and investments total 
table of contents our cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and restricted cash and investments increased by million from july  primarily as a result of net proceeds from the issuance of long term debt of billion  billion in cash provided by operating activities  and million in cash received from the issuance of ordinary shares under employee stock plans 
partially offsetting this increase were million of cash paid to repurchase million of our ordinary shares  million cash paid for capital expenditures  million for the redemption of long term debt and million in dividends paid to our shareholders

we also paid approximately million to repurchase million of our ordinary shares  which was partially offset by million in net proceeds from the issuance of long term debt and million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee stock purchases 
net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal year was attributable to million in net proceeds from the issuance of long term debt  of which million was used to repay our long term debt and the remaining proceeds of million were held in escrow for the repayment and repurchase of our long term debt 
we also had proceeds of million from the draw down of our credit facility offset by million in dividends paid to our shareholders 
liquidity sources our primary sources of liquidity as of july   consisted of approximately billion in cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments  cash we expect to generate from operations and a million senior secured revolving credit facility 
we also had million in restricted cash and investments  of which million was related to our employee deferred compensation liabilities under our non qualified deferred compensation plan

seagate technology plc and certain of its material subsidiaries fully and unconditionally guarantee  on a senior secured basis  the revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility matures in january the revolving credit facility is available for cash borrowings and for the issuance of letters of credit up to a sub limit of million 
as of july   no borrowings have been drawn under the revolving credit facility  and million had been utilized for letters of credit 
the line of credit is available for borrowings  subject to compliance with financial covenants and other customary conditions to borrowing 
the credit agreement that governs our revolving credit facility contains certain covenants that we must satisfy in order to remain in compliance with the credit agreement  including three financial covenants minimum amount of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  a fixed charge coverage ratio  
table of contents and a net leverage ratio 
as of july   we are in compliance with all covenants  including the financial ratios that we are required to maintain 
we believe that our sources of cash will be sufficient to fund our operations and meet our cash requirements for at least the next months 
cash requirements and commitments our liquidity requirements are primarily to meet our working capital  research and development and capital expenditure needs  to fund scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness  and to fund our dividend 
our ability to fund these requirements will depend on our future cash flows  which are determined by future operating performance  and therefore  subject to prevailing global macroeconomic conditions and financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
on july   we announced that our board of directors approved a cash dividend of per share  which will be payable on august  to shareholders of record as of the close of business on august  in fiscal year  we issued billion in long term debt 
we intend to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes  which may include the repayment and or repurchase of a portion of our outstanding indebtedness  capital expenditures and investments in our business 
as of july   we were in compliance with all of the covenants under our debt agreements 
based on our current outlook  we expect to be in compliance with the covenants of our debt agreements over the next months

we currently expect to fund this transaction with our current sources of liquidity and cash from operations 

table of contents for fiscal year  we expect capital investment to be at or below the low end of our targeted range of of revenue 
we require substantial amounts of cash to fund scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness  future capital expenditures and any increased working capital requirements 
we will continue to evaluate and manage the retirement and replacement of existing debt and associated obligations  including the issuance of new debt securities  exchanging existing debt securities for other debt securities and retiring debt pursuant to privately negotiated transactions  open market purchases or otherwise 
in addition  we may selectively pursue strategic alliances  acquisitions and investments  which may require additional capital 
contractual obligations and commitments our contractual cash obligations and commitments as of july   have been summarized in the table below fiscal year s dollars in millions total thereafter contractual cash obligations long term debt interest payments on debt capital expenditures operating leases purchase obligations subtotal commitments letters of credit or bank guarantees total included in long term debt for fiscal year is the principal amount of million related to our notes

purchase obligations are defined as contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services  which are enforceable and legally binding on us  and that specify all significant terms 
as of july   we had a liability for unrecognized tax benefits and an accrual for the payment of related interest totaling million  million of which is expected to be settled within one year 
outside of one year  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when cash settlement with a taxing authority will occur 
off balance sheet arrangements as of july   we did not have any material off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a ii of regulation s k 
critical accounting policies the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements 
the sec has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results  and require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are highly uncertain at the time of estimation 

table of contents based on this definition  our most critical policies include establishment of sales program accruals  establishment of warranty accruals  accounting for income taxes  and the accounting for goodwill and other long lived assets 
below  we discuss these policies further  as well as the estimates and judgments involved 
we also have other accounting policies and accounting estimates relating to uncollectible customer accounts  valuation of inventory  valuation of share based payments and restructuring 
we believe that these other accounting policies and accounting estimates either do not generally require us to make estimates and judgments that are as difficult or as subjective  or it is less likely that they would have a material impact on our reported results of operations for a given period 
establishment of sales program accruals 
we establish certain distributor and oem sales programs aimed at increasing customer demand 
for the distribution channel  these programs typically involve rebates related to a distributor level of sales  order size  advertising or point of sale activity and price protection adjustments 
for oem sales  rebates are typically based on an oem customer volume of purchases or other agreed upon rebate programs 
we provide for these obligations at the time that revenue is recorded based on estimated requirements 
we estimate these contra revenue rebates and adjustments based on various factors  including price reductions during the period reported  estimated future price erosion  customer orders  distributor sell through and inventory levels  program participation  customer claim submittals and sales returns 
our estimates reflect contractual arrangements but also our judgment relating to variables such as customer claim rates and attainment of program goals  and inventory and sell through levels reported by our distribution customers 
currently  our distributors inventories are at the low end of the historical range 
while we believe we have sufficient experience and knowledge of the market and customer buying patterns to reasonably estimate such rebates and adjustments  actual market conditions or customer behavior could differ from our expectations 
as a result  actual payments under these programs  which may spread over several months after the related sale  may vary from the amount accrued 
accordingly  revenues and margins in the period in which the adjustment occurs may be affected 
significant actual variations in any of the factors upon which we base our contra revenue estimates could have a material effect on our operating results 
in fiscal year  sales programs were approximately of gross revenue  reflecting the cumulative effect of the competitive pricing environment during the first half of fiscal year for fiscal years and  total sales programs have ranged from to of gross revenues 
adjustments to revenues due to under or over accruals for sales programs related to revenues reported in prior quarterly periods have averaged of quarterly gross revenue for fiscal years through  and were approximately of quarterly gross revenue in fiscal year any future shifts in the industry supply demand balance as well as other factors may result in a more competitive pricing environment and may cause sales programs as a percentage of gross revenue to increase from the current or historical levels 
if such rebates and incentives trend upwards  revenues and margins will be reduced 
establishment of warranty accruals 
we estimate probable product warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized 
we generally warrant our products for a period of one to five years 
our warranty provision considers estimated product failure rates and trends including the timing of product returns during the warranty periods  estimated repair or replacement costs and estimated costs for customer compensatory claims related to product quality issues  if any 
we use a statistical model to help with our estimates and we exercise considerable judgment in determining the underlying estimates 
should actual experience in any future period differ significantly from our estimates  or should the rate of future product technological advancements fail to keep pace with the past  our future results of operations could be materially affected 
our judgment is subject to a greater degree of subjectivity with respect to newly introduced products because of limited experience with those products upon which to base our warranty estimates 

table of contents the actual results with regard to warranty expenditures could have an adverse or favorable effect on our results of operations if the actual rate of unit failure  the cost to repair a unit  or the actual cost required to satisfy customer compensatory claims differs from those estimates we used in determining the warranty accrual 
since we typically outsource our warranty repairs  our repair cost is subject to periodic negotiations with vendors and may vary from our estimates 
we also exercise judgment in estimating our ability to sell certain repaired disk drives 
to the extent such sales fall below our forecast  warranty cost will be adversely impacted 
we review our warranty accrual quarterly for products shipped in prior periods and which are still under warranty 
any changes in the estimates underlying the accrual may result in adjustments that impact the current period gross margins and income 
in fiscal year  net favorable changes in estimates of prior warranty accruals as a percentage of revenue were not material 
our total warranty cost was  and of revenue during fiscal years  and  respectively  while warranty cost related to new shipments exclusive of the impact of re estimates of pre existing liabilities were  and respectively  for the same periods 
changes in anticipated failure rates of specific products and significant changes in repair or replacement costs have historically been the major reasons for significant changes in prior estimates 
any future changes in failure rates of certain products  as well as changes in repair costs or the cost of replacement parts  may result in increased or decreased warranty accruals 
accounting for income taxes 
we account for income taxes pursuant to accounting standards codification asc topic asc  income taxes 
in applying  asc  we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits  recognition of income and deductions and calculation of specific tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes  as well as tax liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the internal revenue service or other tax jurisdictions 
if estimates of these tax liabilities are greater or less than actual results  an additional tax benefit or provision will result 
the deferred tax assets we record each period depend primarily on our ability to generate future taxable income in the united states and certain non us jurisdictions 
each period  we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets and  if necessary  we adjust the valuation allowance so that net deferred tax assets are recorded only to the extent we conclude it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized 
if our outlook for future taxable income changes significantly  our assessment of the need for a valuation allowance may also change 
accounting for goodwill  and other long lived assets 
we account for goodwill in accordance with asc  intangibles goodwill and other 
as required by asc  we test goodwill of our reporting units annually during our fourth quarter or whenever events occur or circumstances change  such as an adverse change in business climate or a decline in the overall industry  that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
in accordance with asc  impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we test other long lived assets  including property  equipment and leasehold improvements and other intangible assets subject to amortization  for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of those assets may not be recoverable 
we assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group 
if the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable  we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using the same approaches indicated above for asc step two and compare it to its carrying value 
the excess of the carrying value over the fair value is allocated pro rata to derive the adjusted carrying value of each asset in the asset group 
the adjusted carrying value of each asset in the asset group is not reduced below its fair value
