economic overview like many other financial institutions  we have been affected by the national economic recession 
the strength of the economic recovery in the geographic markets where we operate  and the united states in general  varied throughout  although ended with a positive tone 
during the first quarter of  gross domestic product gdp increased  the second biggest quarterly increase since the recession began in december of gdp growth continued into the second and third quarters of  although at a lower level 
the average quarterly gdp growth of for the first three quarters of represents a significant improvement from the average quarterly change in gdp of 
and also outpaces the ten year average of 
growth in was supported by businesses rebuilding inventory levels and capital spending on equipment and software 
growth was also sustained by increasing contributions from consumer spending  which grew at an average monthly rate of 
for  matching the rate of growth in unemployment declined modestly  beginning the year at and ending at 
home values were mostly stable and equities were volatile but finished the year with mid double digit gains 
double dip fears  global macro concerns  and a mid summer soft patch of economic data led to another round of quantitative easing by the frb 
this additional monetary easing combined with fiscal stimulus from larger than expected tax cuts  gave the economy a boost in the last few months of regulatory reform developments as discussed in more detail above  on july   president obama signed the dodd frank act into law 
the dodd frank act is intended to address perceived deficiencies and gaps in the regulatory framework for financial services in the united states  reduce the risks of bank failures and better equip the nation s regulators to guard against or mitigate any future financial crises  and manage systemic risk through increased supervision of systemically important financial companies including nonbank financial companies 
the dodd frank act implements numerous and far reaching changes across the financial landscape affecting financial companies  including banks and bank holding companies such as bkfc 
for a review of the various changes that the dodd frank act implements  see the regulation and supervision the dodd frank act in item business of this annual report 
many of the rulemakings required by the various regulatory agencies are still in the process of being developed and or implemented 
common stock offering  partial cpp repurchase 
table of contents during  bkfc completed a secondary public offering of  shares of common stock at per share  for net proceeds of approximately million 
this offering was followed by the company s repurchase  on december   of million of the outstanding million in series a preferred stock issued in conjunction with the tarp cpp 
the common stock offering and the subsequent repurchase of one half of the treasury department s cpp investment was an important step towards bkfc s complete exit out of the cpp 
management originally decided to participate in the cpp in to reinforce its strong capital position  advance the treasury department s efforts to facilitate additional lending in the markets in which the bank operates  maintain its competitive advantage over its less well capitalized competitors  ensure sufficient capital to support future acquisitions and support its general operations 
management believes that bkfc has achieved these goals that were established when the tarp investment was made 
subject to receiving all necessary regulatory approvals  management intends to cause bkfc to repurchase the remaining cpp investment as soon as reasonably possible through current earnings  additional capital raising  or a combination of both 
for additional information see capital purchase program below 
performance overview while the economy continued to show signs of improvement during  strong revenue growth overcame higher provisioning expense to produce a increase in net income available to bkfc common shareholders in as compared to total revenue increased in  offsetting a increase in the provision for loan losses and the increase in non interest expense 
this revenue increase included a  or  increase in net interest income and a  or  increase in non interest income 
two acquisitions that were completed in the fourth quarter of had a significant impact on the company s income as compared to in the fourth quarter of the bank completed the purchase of three banking offices of integra bank and a portfolio of selected commercial loans originated by integra bank s covington  kentucky loan production office 
this transaction added million in deposits and million in loans 
the bank also completed the purchase of tam during the fourth quarter of although bkfc continued to experience an increase in defaults and foreclosures during fiscal  such default levels have been significantly less as compared to other regions of the country 
this is due  in part  to the fact that bkfc s market in northern kentucky and cincinnati did not experience as dramatic a rise in real estate values over the last several years as compared to other markets  such as florida and california 
while bkfc s local markets have not been affected as severely as other markets  management continues to closely monitor developments in the real estate market  given that the majority of the bank s loan portfolio is real estate related 
while the level of resources devoted to the credit review function and working out problem loans continued to be high in  bkfc did not make significant changes to its loan underwriting standards 
bkfc s willingness to make loans to qualified applicants that meet its traditional  prudent lending standards has not changed 
as discussed above  current economic conditions facing the country and the region in which bkfc operates was a significant factor affecting the financial results 
in particular  high unemployment and falling real estate values continued to place significant economic strain on a majority of the bank s business partners 
the bank s loan portfolio has been most significantly affected by economic conditions 
the credit quality metrics of the bank s loan portfolio continued to show the strain of these economic conditions in while charge offs increased from due to these economic strains and falling real estate values  non performing loans decreased in  although they remained at historically high levels 
charge offs increased from  in to  in  while non performing loans decreased from  at the end of to  at the end of these credit quality metrics led the bank to provide  in the provision for loans losses in versus  in as a result  the allowance for loan losses rose from  at december  to  at december  to be directionally consistent with the economic strains on the bank s loan portfolio 
on a quarterly  sequential basis  management saw improving credit metrics throughout  as net charge offs decreased from  in the first half of to  in the second half of however  management sees continued economic strain in despite the economic recovery  and expects continuing higher than normal credit losses and provisioning expense in the foreseeable future 
the following sections provide more detail on subjects presented in this overview 

table of contents capital purchase program on february   bkfc entered into the purchase agreement with the treasury department under the cpp  pursuant to which bkfc agreed to issue  shares of series a preferred stock  for a total price of million 
the series a preferred stock pays cumulative dividends at a rate of per year for the first five years and thereafter at a rate of per year 
the series a preferred stock and the warrant were originally issued in a private placement exempt from registration pursuant to section of the securities act of bkfc is further required pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement to register the resale of the series a preferred stock  the warrant and the issuance of shares of common stock upon exercise of the warrant with the sec 
the warrant has been exercisable since february   its date of issuance 
bkfc chose to participate in the cpp in order to reinforce its strong capital position  advance the treasury department s efforts to facilitate additional lending in the markets in which the bank operates  maintain its competitive advantage over its less well capitalized competitors  ensure sufficient capital to support future acquisitions and support its general operations 
bkfc s decision to participate in the cpp was also affected by discussions with its regulators  including the fdic and the federal reserve bank of cleveland 
in light of the turmoil in the banking sector  uncertainty as to government action in the future with respect to risk based capital guidelines  as well as the general economy as a whole  bkfc elected to request the maximum amount available for investment by the treasury department under the cpp of the bank s risk weighted assets for the reasons described above 
as discussed above  on december   bkfc used a portion of the proceeds from its secondary common stock offering to repurchase million of the outstanding million of series a preferred stock 
as a result  million of series a preferred stock remains outstanding  as well as the warrant for  shares originally issued to the treasury department 
accordingly  bkfc remains subject to the restrictions applicable to cpp participants 
use of capital the cpp funds have not been segregated from bkfc s other funds  and thus those funds cannot be directly traced through bkfc s balance sheet 
based on analysis of the market conditions at the time of issuance  bkfc determined that the proceeds of the treasury department s investment in its series a preferred stock initially would be best deployed in us government agency mbs until loan demand improved 
bkfc retained million of the proceeds to extinguish short term debt and further augment its capital position  and invested the remaining million in the bank 
in turn  the bank invested the million of the proceeds  along with other funds obtained  to leverage the cpp investment  in mbs pending deployment in more permanent uses such as for acquisitions and to support loan growth 
with these investments  bkfc provided incremental liquidity to the residential mortgage markets and at the same time obtained products that generate cash flow 
bkfc is holding the mbs assets on its balance sheet as available for sale 
bkfc intends to utilize its cash flows  including those derived from its mbs investments and the proceeds of any sale or disposition of its mbs investments  to fund commercial and residential loans that meet bkfc s long standing prudent lending standards as the demand for high quality loans rises in the markets it serves and otherwise support its business 
bkfc is committed to making credit available to the markets it serves and fulfilling the needs of its customers 
to ensure that all lending growth opportunities are addressed  the bank in implemented a new loan committee structure  adding the bank s chief executive officer to the bank s loan committee to further scrutinize credit decisions 
additionally  the bank established a problem asset workout group in in addition to managing distressed assets  this group provides advice and support for the bank s lending professionals with respect to those relationships that are showing signs of stress  but have not elevated to the point of transfer to workout  to address the needs of existing clients 
in certain sectors  such as commercial lending  loan demand has diminished  consistent with the overall economy  as customers have taken a conservative direction and postponed investments 
conversely  residential mortgage activity increased in and in response to favorable interest rates and new government 
table of contents agency programs 
while the cpp funds have not been segregated  and this increased lending is not directly traceable in a dollar for dollar manner to the cpp  the cpp investment has strengthened bkfc s balance sheet and capital position 
in addition  bkfc has not experienced the level of stress or deterioration in its residential real estate portfolio that other financial institutions may be experiencing  and the bank has not created or marketed to its customers any sub prime loan products  does not service mortgages for other institutions and otherwise follows a strategy in selling the majority of the bank s residential loans into the secondary market 
in the majority of situations  the bank follows the underwriting guidelines of the various government agencies on loans the bank seeks to portfolio 
for the year ended december   the bank s residential real estate loan production was million  which was higher than the million of loans originated in of this  sold loans totaled million  while portfolio and construction loans totaled million and million  respectively 
the average balance of amortizing portfolio loans during was million compared to million in and million in residential real estate charge offs in this portfolio in were 
compared to and which were 
and 
respectively 
delinquencies have been moderate  and non accruals were million as of december  versus million outstanding amortizing portfolio loan balances  or 
these statistics are a result of the bank s underwriting and collection practices 
the bank has also added full time equivalent resources to its collections department  allowing the bank to make more frequent and earlier collection calls  resulting in better working relationships with those borrowers who may have difficulty in making timely payments 
effects of cpp participation the terms of the series a preferred stock provide that  in the event bkfc defaults on the payment of dividends due on the series a preferred stock for an aggregate of six quarters or more  the board of directors of bkfc shall be automatically increased by two positions  and the holders of the series a preferred stock shall have the right to elect two directors to fill those positions 
bkfc did not need to amend its bylaws to increase the maximum size of the board of directors in order to accommodate an election of those two directors 
bkfc did not have any other senior class of securities outstanding at the time it entered into the purchase agreement 
with respect to bkfc s day to day operations  participation in the cpp heightened the focus on originating new loans that meet the bank s prudent lending standards and strengthened bkfc s capital ratios 
for example  at december  prior to the cpp transaction  bkfc s ratios of total capital to risk weighted assets  tier capital to risk weighted assets and tier capital to average assets were  and  respectively 
at march  following the february  cpp transaction bkfc s ratios of total capital to risk weighted assets  tier capital to risk weighted assets and tier capital to average assets were  and  respectively 
however  it should be noted that  prior to bkfc s participation in the cpp  both it and the bank were well capitalized 
at december   bkfc s ratios of total capital to risk weighted assets  tier capital to risk weighted assets and tier capital to average assets were  and  respectively  each of these ratios exceeded the respective ratios of  and  which are the minimum ratios of regulatory capital required to be well capitalized 
bkfc s participation in the cpp has affected  and will continue to affect until no obligations remain outstanding under the cpp  the income available to common shareholders in two ways i bkfc agreed in the purchase agreement to not pay any dividend on the common stock prior to february  other than regular quarterly cash dividends of not more than per share of common stock  and ii the dividend payments which are due on the series a preferred stock have the effect of reducing the net income otherwise available to the common shareholders 
the terms of the purchase agreement prohibit repurchases of common stock although there was no intent  at the time of the issuance of the series a preferred stock  for bkfc to buy back or otherwise repurchase any of its common stock 
until such time as bkfc has completed the repurchase of the remaining million of cpp investment held by the treasury department  bkfc will continue to comply with the executive compensation and corporate governance requirements of each of the eesa  the arra and any subsequent legislation  regulations or guidance for so long as the series a preferred stock or any other security acquired under the purchase agreement is held by the treasury department 
as required by the eesa and arra  bkfc has limited the section m tax 
table of contents deduction for executive compensation to  per year for any senior executive officer for so long as the series a preferred stock or any other security acquired under the purchase agreement is held by the treasury department 
an executive compensation risk assessment was performed by bkfc s senior risk officers 
based on the materials reviewed  bkfc s senior risk officers concluded that the executive compensation and incentive program as then in effect did not encourage the senior executive officers to take unnecessary and excessive risks 
the findings of this risk assessment were presented to the compensation committee of the board of directors and final conclusions were provided to the full board of directors 
a certification statement has been included within the compensation committee report of the bkfc proxy statement 
this risk assessment will occur each year in which the series a preferred stock or any other security acquired under the purchase agreement is held by the treasury department 
in addition  the compensation committee  which is composed entirely of independent directors  will discuss bkfc s compensation arrangements in light of such risk assessment at least semi annually for so long as the series a preferred stock or any other security acquired under the purchase agreement is held by the treasury department 
bkfc s proxy statement permitted a nonbinding shareholder vote to provide advisory approval of the compensation of bkfc s executives 
critical accounting policies bkfc has prepared all of the consolidated financial information in this annual report in accordance with gaap 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap  bkfc makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurances that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
we have identified the accounting policy related to the allowance for loan losses as critical to the understanding of bkfc s results of operations  since the application of this policy requires significant management assumptions and estimates that could result in reporting materially different amounts if conditions or underlying circumstances were to change 
the bank maintains an allowance to absorb probable  incurred loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level the bank considers to be adequate and is based upon ongoing quarterly assessments and evaluations of the collectability and historical loss experience of loans 
loan losses are charged and recoveries are credited to the allowance for loan losses 
provisions for loan losses are based on the bank s review of its historical loan loss experience and such factors that  in management s judgment  deserve consideration under existing economic conditions in estimating probable loan losses 
the bank s strategy for credit risk management includes a combination of well defined credit policies  uniform underwriting criteria  and ongoing risk monitoring and review processes for all commercial and consumer credit exposures 
the credit risk management strategy also includes assessments of compliance with commercial and consumer policies  risk ratings and other important credit information 
the strategy also emphasizes regular credit examinations and management reviews of loans exhibiting deterioration in credit quality 
the bank strives to identify potential problem loans early and promptly undertake the appropriate actions necessary to mitigate or eliminate the increasing risk identified in these loans 
the allowance for loan losses consists of two components  the specific reserve  pursuant to asc  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  and the general reserve  pursuant to asc  accounting for contingencies 
a loan is considered impaired when  based upon current information and events it is probable that the bank will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan 
the specific reserve component is an estimate of loss based upon an impairment review of larger loans that are considered impaired 
the general reserve includes an estimate of commercial and consumer loans with similar characteristics 
depending on the set of facts with respect to a particular loan  the bank utilizes one of the following methods for determining the proper impairment of a loan the present value of expected future cash flows of a loan  the market price of the loan based upon readily available information for that type of loan  and the fair value of collateral 

table of contents the allowance established for impaired loans is generally based  for all collateral dependent loans  on the fair market value of the collateral  less the estimated cost to liquidate 
for non collateral dependent loans such as accruing troubled debt restructurings  the allowance is based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted by the loan s effective interest rate 
a small portion of the bank s loans which are impaired under the asc process carry no specific reserve allocation 
these loans were reviewed for impairment and are considered adequately collateralized with respect to their respective outstanding principal loan balances 
the majority of these loans are loans which have had their respective impairment or specific reserve amounts charged off  or are loans related to other impaired loans which continue to have a specific reserve allocation 
it is the bank s practice to maintain these impaired loans  as analyzed and provided for in the asc component of the allowance for loan losses  to avoid double counting of any estimated losses that may have been included in the asc component of the allowance for loan losses 
generally  the bank orders a new or updated appraisal on real estate properties which are subject to an impairment review 
upon completion of the impairment review  loan reserves are increased as warranted 
charge offs  if necessary  are generally recognized in a period after the reserves were established 
adjustments to new or updated appraisal values are not typical  but in those cases when an adjustment is necessary  it is documented with supporting information and typically results in an adjustment to decrease the property s value because of additional information obtained concerning the property after the appraisal or update has been received by the bank 
the bank s practice is to obtain new or updated appraisals on the loans subject to impairment review 
if a new or updated appraisal is not available at the time of a loan s impairment review  the bank typically applies a discount to the value of an old appraisal to reflect the property s current estimated value if there is believed to be deterioration in either i the physical or economic aspects of the subject property or ii any market conditions 
updated valuations on to family residential properties with small to moderate values are generally accomplished by obtaining an automated valuation model avm or a broker s price opinion bpo 
generally  an as is value is utilized in most of the bank s real estate based impairment analyses 
however  under certain limited circumstances an as stabilized valuation may be utilized  provided that the as stabilized value is tied to a well justified action plan to bring the real estate project to a stabilized occupancy under a reasonable period of time 
if a partially charged off loan has been restructured in a manner that is reasonably assured of repayment and performance according to prudently modified terms  and has sustained historical payment performance for a reasonable period of time prior to and or after the restructuring  it may be returned to accrual status and is classified as a tdr loan 
however  if the above conditions can not be reasonably met  the loan remains on non accrual status 
in addition  the bank evaluates the collectability of both principal and interest when assessing the need for loans to be placed on non accrual status 
non accrual status denotes loans in which  in the opinion of management  the collection of additional interest is unlikely 
a loan is generally placed on non accrual status if i it becomes days or more past due days past due for consumer loans  or ii for which payment in full of both principal and interest can not be reasonably expected 
historical loss rates are applied to all other loans not subject to specific reserve allocations 
the loss rates applied to loans are derived from analyzing a range of the loss experience sustained on loans according to their internal risk rating 
these loss rates may be adjusted to account for environmental factors  if warranted 
the general reserve also includes homogeneous loans  such as consumer installment  residential mortgage and home equity loans that are not individually risk graded 
for these loans that are not individually risk graded  a range of historic loss experience of the portfolio is used to determine the appropriate allowance for the portfolios 
allocations for the allowance are established for each pool of loans based on the expected net charge offs for one year 
a high and low range of reserve percentages is calculated to recognize the imprecision in estimating and measuring loss when evaluating reserves for pools of loans 
the position of the allowance for loan losses within the computed range may be adjusted for significant factors that  in management s judgment  reflect the impact of any current conditions of credit quality 
factors that management considers in this analysis include the effects of the local economy  trends in the nature and volume of loans delinquencies  charge offs and non accrual loans  changes in mix of loans  asset quality trends  risk management and loan administration  changes in the internal lending policies and credit standards  and an examination of results from bank regulatory agencies and an internal review by the bank s risk management and credit administration divisions 

table of contents reserves on individual loans and historical loss rates are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as necessary based on changing borrower and or collateral conditions  as well as actual collection and charge off experience 
charge offs are recognized when it becomes evident that a loan or a portion of a loan is deemed uncollectible regardless of its delinquent status 
the bank generally charges off that portion of a loan that is determined to be unsupported by an obligor s continued ability to repay the loan from income and or assets  both pledged and unpledged as collateral 
financial condition driving the changes to the bkfc balance sheet from december  to december  was continued deposit growth  slowing loan demand and a stronger capital position 
total deposits increased  or from the end of to the end of  while total loans decreased  or in the same period of time 
as discussed above  the secondary common stock offering less the partial repayment of the cpp investment added approximately  to our capital 
as a result of these changes  the bank s total assets increased  or from  at december  to  at december  on the asset side of the balance sheet  deposit growth and the proceeds from the common stock offering outpaced quality loan demand 
as a result  both available for sale securities and short term investments grew significantly from december of to december of in  available for sale securities increased  or from  while short term investments increased  from  at december  to  at december  the increase in available for sale securities consisted of purchases of government sponsored agency bonds and government agency mbs 
the increase in short term investments consisted of higher federal funds sold to other financial institutions 
while the bank continues to experience decreased levels of new and renewed residential real estate  commercial and consumer loans originated as a result of the current economic recession  the bank intends to continue to work to make loans that meet its longstanding prudent lending standards 
the decrease in total loans was distributed between construction  commercial  and residential real estate in  with decreases of     and   respectively 
the largest increase in deposits came from noninterest bearing demand deposit accounts dda  which increased  or  from in addition to strong growth in corporate dda balances  management believes that the lower level of interest rates offered on other transaction accounts contributed to the growth in overall dda balances 
other changes on the asset side of the balance sheet at december  relative to december  included an  increase in loans held for sale 
this increase  driven by low rates  was the result of the current demand for home mortgage loan refinancing 
other changes to liabilities included an increase of  in notes payable and a decrease in other liabilities of  
the increase in notes payable was the result of an increase of  in fhlb advances  which were entered into as a result of attractive rates 
the decrease in other liabilities was the result of a final settlement owed to integra bank for the acquisition of  that was paid in january of total shareholders equity increased  to  at december   compared to  at december  as discussed above  approximately  of the increase in shareholders equity was the result of the net increase from the common stock offering and the subsequent tarp repayment 
the following table illustrates the change in the mix of average assets during as compared to and with slowing loan demand and increasing deposits  the percentage of assets invested in short term investments and securities has increased from in to in  while the percentage of assets invested in loans decreased from in to in table average assets  and dollars in thousands

driven by higher revenue  net income available to common shareholders increased from from  for the year ended december   to  for the year ended december  the growth in earnings from to was driven by increases in net interest income of  and non interest income of  
and was offset by a higher provision for loan losses of  and by an increase in non interest expense of  
the growth in the net interest income was driven relatively equally by growth in earning assets and by an improving net interest spread  which was the result of the cost of interest bearing liabilities falling faster than yields on earning assets and  as a result  the net interest margin increased from in to in leading the growth in non interest income was a  increase in mortgage banking income and a  increase in trust fee income 
the low interest rate environment also led to the increase in mortgage banking income as homeowners refinanced their existing loans to lower rates 
as discussed in the management overview section of this report  two acquisitions completed in the fourth quarter of had an impact on the financial comparisons between and the provision for loan losses reflected the current stressed economic conditions that has continued to put significant strains on the loan portfolio in these strains showed in the net charge offs that increased from

the increase in non interest income included  in gains on the sale of securities and a  or increase in mortgage banking income

table of contents took advantage of the low interest rate environment and sold  in government sponsored agency bonds for a gain of  the low interest rate environment also led to the increase in mortgage banking income as the demand by homeowners to refinance their existing loans to lower rates remained high throughout the year 
net interest income vs 
net interest income grew to  in  an increase of   over the  earned in as discussed above  the increase was driven by the growth in earning assets and an improved net interest spread 
as illustrated in table  both the volume and rate variances had a positive impact on net interest income in as compared with table shows the net interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis was positively impacted by the volume additions to the balance sheet by  and by a positive rate variance by  as illustrated in table  the results of this favorable rate variance was a basis point increase in the net interest spread from in to in also illustrated in table  the net interest margin of for was basis points greater than the net interest margin for the cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points from for to in  while the yield on earning assets only decreased basis points from for to in contributing to the favorable volume variance was the integra bank acquisition that added approximately  in loans and  in deposits 
as illustrated in table  average earning assets increased  or from to  while average interest bearing liabilities only increased  or in the same period 
as further illustrated in table  the favorable rate variance was driven by the decrease in interest expense attributable to rate of  which was offset by a  decrease in interest income as a result of rate 
driving the decrease in interest expense were time deposits  which contributed  or of the decrease in interest expense as a result of rate 
while bkfc benefited from falling rates in as compared to  if rates continue to fall in the effect on bkfc will be negative  as shown and explained below under the heading asset liability management and market risk 
vs 
net interest income grew to  in  an increase of   over the  earned in as discussed above  the increase was driven by the growth in earning assets 
as illustrated in table  net interest income was positively impacted by the volume additions to the balance sheet by  while the decline in interest rates had been dramatic over the prior three years as a result of the deep economic recession  the effect on the net interest margin of the bank has been nominal 
this is a result of the conservative interest rate risk management program of the bank that seeks to minimize the risk to earnings in both a falling or rising interest rate environment 
as illustrated in table  the net interest margin has remained within four basis points over the prior two years at and in and  respectively 
also illustrated in table  this risk management position is reflected in the small change in the interest rate spread  increasing basis points in versus despite the significant drop in both the yield on earning assets and interest cost of interest bearing liabilities 
in  total average earning assets increased  or with the growth in divided between loans  which increased  or  and securities  which increased  or 
despite an extremely volatile interest rate environment  bkfcs net interest spread increased from in to in  which was offset by a reduction in the effects of free funds which decreased from 
in to 
in the effects of this rate environment are demonstrated in table  where the yields on interest earning assets decreased by basis points from in to in  while the cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points from in to in average yield 
table  shown below  illustrates the bank s average balance sheet information and reflects the average yield on interest earning assets  on a tax equivalent basis  and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities for the periods indicated

provision for loan losses like many other financial institutions  the bank has been significantly affected by the national economic recession  and the continued challenging economic environment 
while the bank experienced an increase in defaults and foreclosures in fiscal years and  the levels of such activity has been significantly less than other regions in the country due  in part  to the fact that the bank s market in the northern kentucky and greater cincinnati area did not experience as dramatic a rise in real estate values over the last several years as other markets 
management believes that with the continuing economic uncertainty  high unemployment rates and falling real estate values  negative trends in credit metrics and the resulting pressure on earnings will remain above historical levels 
this will include continuing higher levels of charge offs in the loan portfolio  and as a result  higher provisions for loan losses and a higher reserve for loan losses on the balance sheet 
higher provisions for loan losses will lead to lower earnings and slower capital growth 
management also believes that the current economic conditions will lead to lower demand for loans within all loan types  specifically  real estate related requests 
as discussed above  the provision for loan losses reflected the current challenging economic environment facing the country and the region 
although the credit metrics have deteriorated significantly since the beginning of the current economic downturn  there were signs of improvement in the level of non performing loans decreased from  which allowed on a quarterly sequential basis for the provision expense to decrease as progressed

contributing to both the increase in charge offs in and the increase in the allowance for loan losses was the significant decrease in real estate values experienced in the current economic environment

management continues to monitor the loan portfolio closely and believes the provision for loan losses is directionally consistent with the changes in the probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio from to the bank does not originate or purchase sub prime loans for its portfolio 
management will continue to monitor and evaluate the effects of the slumping housing market conditions and any signs of further deterioration in credit quality on the bank s loan portfolio 
management believes these economic strains will continue into and expects continuing higher than normal credit losses and provisioning expense in the foreseeable future

in order to meet the financing needs of its customers  the bank is also a party to certain financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business 
these financial instruments include 
table of contents commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit  which involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit risk and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in bkfc s consolidated balance sheets

table significant off balance sheet commitments in thousands maturity by period total less than year years years more than years unused lines of credit and loan commitments standby letters of credit fhlb letters of credit unused lines of credit and loan commitments assure a borrower of financing for a specified period of time at a specified rate 
the risk to the bank under such commitments is limited to the terms of the contracts 
for example  the bank may not be obligated to advance funds if the customer s financial condition deteriorates or if the customer fails to meet specific covenants 
an approved  but unfunded  loan commitment represents a potential credit risk once the funds are advanced to the customer 
the unused lines of credit and loan commitments also represent a future cash requirement  but this cash requirement will be limited since many commitments are expected to expire or only be used partially 
standby letters of credit represent commitments by the bank to repay a third party beneficiary when a customer fails to repay a loan or debt instrument 
the terms and risk of loss involved in issuing standby letters of credit are similar to those involved in issuing loan commitments and extending credit 
in addition to credit risk  the letters of credit could present an immediate cash requirement if the obligations require funding 
the bank maintains letters of credit from the fhlb to collateralize public funds deposits 
these letters of credit reduce the bank s available borrowing line at the fhlb 
on march   the bank entered into an agreement with northern kentucky university the university whereby the university granted to the bank the naming rights for the new northern kentucky university arena constructed on the campus of the university for a term commencing immediately upon execution of the agreement and expiring twenty years after the opening of the arena 
in consideration therefore  the bank paid the lesser of of the total construction cost of the arena or  such sum to be paid in seven equal annual installments beginning after substantial completion and opening of the arena 
the cost of the naming rights will be amortized over the life of the contract commencing on the opening of the arena  which took place in september in the second quarter of  the bank and thomas more college announced a naming rights agreement for the new athletic field constructed on thomas more s campus

effect of inflation and changing prices the financial statements and related financial data presented in this annual report have been prepared in accordance with gaap  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than do general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services 
adoption of new accounting standards in april  the fasb issued guidance impacting asc  recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments  which amends existing guidance for determining whether an impairment is other than temporary for debt securities 
the additional guidance requires an entity to assess whether it intends to sell  or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell  a security in an unrealized loss position before recovery of its amortized cost basis 
if either of these criteria is met  the entire difference between amortized cost and fair value is recognized in earnings 
for securities that do not meet the aforementioned criteria  the amount of impairment recognized in earnings is limited to the amount related to credit losses  while impairment related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income 
additionally  the guidance expands and increases the frequency of existing disclosures about other than temporary impairments for debt and equity securities 
this guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after june   with early adoption permitted for periods ending after march  the company adopted this guidance in the second quarter of the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the results of operations or financial condition

this statement must be applied to transfers occurring on or after the effective date 
additionally  on and after the effective date  the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity is no longer relevant for accounting purposes 
therefore  formerly qualifying special purpose entities should be evaluated for consolidation by reporting entities on and after the effective date in accordance with the applicable consolidation guidance

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk asset liability management and market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to interest rate risk  exchange rate risk  equity price risk or commodity price risk 
the bank does not maintain a trading account for any class of financial instrument and is not currently subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk  equity price risk or commodity price risk 
the bank s market risk is composed primarily of interest rate risk 
the bank utilizes an earnings simulation model to measure and define the amount of interest rate risk it assumes 
interest rate risk is the potential for economic losses due to future interest rate changes 
these economic 
table of contents losses can be reflected as a loss of future net interest income and or a decline in fair market values 
interest rate risk results from the fact that the interest sensitive assets and liabilities can adjust their rates at different times and by different amounts 
the goal of asset liability management is to maintain a high  yet stable  net interest margin and to manage the effect that changes in market interest rates will have on net interest income 
a common measure of interest rate risk is interest rate gap measurement 
the gap is the difference  in dollars  between the amount of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that will reprice within a certain time frame 
repricing can occur when an asset or liability matures or  if an adjustable rate instrument  when it can be adjusted 
typically  the measurement will focus on the interest rate gap position over the next months 
an institution is said to have a negative gap position when more interest bearing liabilities reprice within a certain period than interest earning assets  and a positive gap position when more interest earning assets reprice than interest bearing liabilities 
interest rate gap is considered an indicator of the effect that changing rates may have on net interest income 
generally  an institution with a negative gap will benefit from declining market interest rates and be negatively impacted by rising interest rates 
the bank currently is in a negative gap position    and as a result would  without considering other factors  generally benefit from lower rates and be negatively impacted by higher interest rates 
the ability to benefit from the bank s liability sensitive position would depend on a number of factors  including the competitive pressures on consumer deposit and loan pricing  the movement of certain deposit rate indices in relationship to asset rate indices  and the extent of the decrease in the rate environment 
at december   bkfc s month interest rate gap position  as measured by the bank s asset liability model  was negative 
over the preceding months  interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeded interest rate sensitive assets by  of total assets 
at december   interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeded interest rate sensitive assets by  of total assets 
contributing to the decreased liability sensitive position from to was higher levels of short term investments 
contributing to the increase in short term investments was the deposit growth experienced in and the decrease in total loans 
an assumption  based on historical behavior  contributing to bkfc s gap position is that the balances in now and savings accounts react within a two year timeframe to market rate changes  rather than reacting immediately 
these instruments are not tied to specific indices and are only influenced by market conditions and other factors 
the bank s experience with now and savings accounts has been that they have repriced at a pace equal to approximately of a prime change 
accordingly  a general movement in interest rates may not have an immediate effect on the rates paid on those deposit accounts 
the bank s asset liability management policy establishes guidelines governing the amount of interest income at risk  market value at risk and parameters for the gap position 
management continually monitors these risks through the use of gap analysis and the earnings simulation model 
the simulation model is used to estimate and evaluate the impact of changing interest rates on earnings and market value 
the model projects the effect of instantaneous movements in interest rates of both and basis points 
the assumptions used in the simulation are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the model cannot precisely measure future net interest income 
the results of the model are used by management to approximate the results of rate changes and do not indicate actual expected results 
actual results will differ from the model s simulated results due to timing  frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in various management strategies and market conditions 
additionally  actual results can differ materially from the model if interest rates do not move equally across the yield curve 
the changes in the estimates of an increasing rate scenario on the net interest income change  as shown below  between to were a result of the same influences that increased the liability sensitivity of bkfc s gap position  and show that risk to income from rate changes is in a neutral range 
although the gap position is slightly negative  the results of the simulation show income would rise slightly in a rising rate environment  as a result of the timing of the repricing of assets and liabilities within that month time frame 
the exaggerated effects of the estimates for a decreasing rate environment are the results of the current rate environment 
in december of  the frb lowered the targeted federal funds rate to  and as a result most short term deposit interest rates cannot drop basis points while earning assets could in theory decrease by these amounts 
the result of this extreme low rate environment is a declining rate scenario which produces a negative impact on earnings
