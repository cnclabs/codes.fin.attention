item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for discussion of factors that affect the comparability of the selected financial data 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations background and general our discussions below in this item should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  included in this annual report on form k 
we are engaged in the manufacturing  fabrication  and distribution of specialty metals 
we primarily process basic raw materials such as nickel  cobalt  titanium  manganese  chromium  molybdenum  iron scrap and other metal alloying elements through various melting  hot forming and cold working facilities to produce finished products in the form of billet  bar  rod  wire and narrow strip in many sizes and finishes 
we also produce certain metal powders 
our sales are distributed directly from our production plants and distribution network as well as through independent distributors 
unlike many other specialty steel producers  we operate our own worldwide network of service distribution centers 
these service centers  located in the united states  canada  mexico  europe and asia allow us to work more closely with customers and to offer various just in time stocking programs 
in june we entered into a definitive merger agreement with latrobe specialty metals  inc latrobe whereby we will acquire latrobe in a transaction valued at the time at approximately million 
in the transaction  million shares of carpenter stock  subject to certain adjustments  will be issued to the current owners 
we will also pay million in cash to eliminate latrobe debt at closing and reimburse certain transaction costs 
the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals 
closing is expected to occur during the first half of fiscal year in december  we acquired amega west services llc amega west for million  including assumed debt of million 
amega west offers precision machined down hole drilling tools and services that include nonmag drill collars  stabilizers  mwd and lwd housings  subs  tool rentals  and welding and repair 
in june  we acquired oilfield alloys pte 
ltd 
oilfield alloys for million  which will become part of the amega west operations 
based in singapore  oilfield alloys manufactures and distributes directional drilling equipment in the asia pacific region 
on august   we announced that we plan to construct a new  square foot state of the art manufacturing facility in response to strong customer demand for premium products primarily in the fast growing aerospace and energy industries 
we expect that the new facility will ultimately be capable of producing approximately  tons per year of additional premium product and be operational in approximately months 
the facility is expected to be built on one of several greenfield sites currently under consideration at a total cost of approximately million 
the new facility will include forge  remelting and associated finishing and testing capabilities and will play a key role in further developing our capabilities in the production of our premium products 
as part of our overall business strategy  we have sought out and considered opportunities related to strategic acquisitions and joint collaborations aimed at broadening our offering to the marketplace 
we have participated with other companies to explore potential terms and structure of such opportunities and we expect that we will continue to evaluate these opportunities 

table of contents business trends selected financial results for the past three fiscal years are summarized below fiscal year in millions  except per share data net sales net sales excluding surcharges operating income excluding pension earnings  interest and deferrals pension eid expense and restructuring costs net income diluted earnings per share net pension expense per diluted share purchases of property  equipment and software free cash flow pounds sold in thousands see the section non gaap financial measures below for further discussion of these financial measures 
includes specialty and titanium alloys  stainless steel and powder materials our sales are across a diversified list of end use markets 
the table below summarizes our estimated sales by market over the past three fiscal years 
fiscal year in millions aerospace industrial energy consumer automotive medical total net sales the table below shows our net sales by major product class for the past three fiscal years 
table of contents fiscal year in millions special alloys stainless steels titanium products other materials total net sales impact of raw material prices and product mix we value most of our inventory utilizing the last in  first out lifo inventory costing methodology 
under the lifo inventory costing method  changes in the cost of raw materials and production activities are recognized in cost of sales in the current period even though these materials may have been acquired at potentially significantly different values due to the length of time from the acquisition of the raw materials to the sale of the processed finished goods to the customers 
in a period of rising raw material costs  the lifo inventory valuation normally results in higher costs of sales 
conversely  in a period of decreasing raw material costs  the lifo inventory valuation normally results in lower costs of sales 
the volatility of the costs of raw materials has impacted our operations over the past several years 
we  and others in our industry  generally have been able to pass cost increases on major raw materials through to our customers using surcharges that are structured to recover increases in raw material costs 
generally  the formula used to calculate a surcharge is based on published prices of the respective raw materials for the previous month which correlates to the prices we pay for our raw material purchases 
however  a portion of our surcharges to customers may be calculated using a different surcharge formula or may be based on the raw material prices at the time of order  which creates a lag between surcharge revenue and corresponding raw material costs recognized in costs of sales 
the surcharge mechanism protects our net income on such sales except for the lag effect discussed above 
however  surcharges have had a dilutive effect on our gross margin and operating margin percentages as described later in this report 
a portion of our business consists of sales to customers under firm price sales arrangements 
firm price sales arrangements involve a risk of profit margin fluctuations  particularly when raw material prices are volatile 
in order to reduce the risk of fluctuating profit margins on these sales  we enter into commodity forward contracts to purchase certain critical raw materials necessary to produce the related products sold 
firm price sales arrangements generally include certain annual purchasing commitments and consumption schedules agreed to by the customers at selling prices based on raw material prices at the time the arrangements are established 
if a customer fails to meet the volume commitments or the consumption schedule deviates from the agreed upon terms of the firm price sales arrangements  the company may need to absorb the gains or losses associated with the commodity forward contracts on a temporary basis 
gains or losses associated with commodity forward contracts are reclassified to earnings loss when earnings are impacted by the hedged transaction 
because we value most of our inventory under the lifo costing methodology  the gains and or losses associated with commodity forward contracts may not impact the same period that the firm price sales arrangements revenue is recognized  and comparisons of gross profit from period to period may be impacted 
these firm price sales arrangements are expected to continue as we look to strengthen our long term customer relationships by expanding  renewing and in certain cases extending to a longer term  our customer long term arrangements 
we produce hundreds of grades of materials  with a wide range of pricing and profit levels depending on the grade 
in addition  our product mix within a period is subject to the fluctuating order patterns of our customers as well as decisions we may make on participation in certain products based on available capacity including the impacts of capacity commitments we may have under existing customer agreements 
while we expect to see positive contribution from a more favorable product mix in our margin performance over time  the impact by period may fluctuate  and period to period comparisons may vary 

table of contents net pension expense net pension expense  as we define it below  includes the net periodic benefit costs related to both our pension and other postretirement plans 
net pension expense is recorded in accounts that are included in both the cost of sales and selling  general and administrative expenses lines of our statements of income 
the following is a summary of the classification of net pension expense included in our statements of income during fiscal years  and fiscal year in millions cost of sales selling  general and administrative expenses pension settlement charges included in restructuring charges net pension expense net pension expense is determined annually based on beginning of year balances  and is recorded ratably throughout the fiscal year  unless a significant re measurement event occurs 
the following is a summary of the components of net pension expense during fiscal year  and fiscal year in millions service cost pension earnings  interest and deferrals pension settlement charges included in restructuring charges net pension expense the service cost component of net pension expense represents the estimated cost of future pension liabilities earned associated with active employees 
the pension earnings  interest and deferrals expense is comprised of the expected return on plan assets  interest costs on the projected benefit obligations of the plans  and amortization of actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs 
pension earnings  interest and deferrals expenses is impacted by the financial markets and increased significantly during fiscal year principally due to the decline in market value of the securities held by the plans as of june  operating performance overview fiscal year results reflect the benefits of strong  sustained demand across all our end use markets 
we have made progress during fiscal year in the following important areas we worked to strengthen customer relationships  expanded our market share in key segments and negotiated to expand key long term agreements 
we increased our volume output by percent and made fundamental improvements to our profit per pound performance as a result of pricing and mix management actions 
we positioned the business for continued success by addressing current and future capacity needs to support customer demand by completing several key acquisitions and collaborations 
we also announced several capacity expansion projects 
at the same time  we strengthened our capital structure to ensure we can fund future growth need 

table of contents results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year for fiscal year  we reported net income attributable to carpenter of million  or per diluted share  compared with net income attributable to carpenter of million  or per diluted share  a year earlier 
our fiscal year results reflect a trend of improving revenues and profit throughout the fiscal year driven by increased demand across all our end use markets as well as the benefits of our pricing and mix management efforts  particularly in the second half of fiscal year net sales net sales for fiscal year were  million  which was a percent increase from fiscal year excluding surcharge revenues  sales were  million  an increase of percent from a year earlier on percent higher volume 
geographically  sales outside the united states increased percent from a year ago to million 
international sales remained fairly consistent as a percentage of our total net sales  representing percent for fiscal years and sales by end use markets we sell to customers across diversified end use markets 
during fiscal year  we changed the manner in which sales are classified by end use market so that we could better evaluate our sales results from period to period 
in order to make the discussion of net sales by end use market meaningful  we have reclassified the fiscal year sales by end use market balances to conform to the fiscal year presentation 
although we are not organized to report other than sales by end use market  the following table includes comparative information for our estimated net sales by principal end use markets which we believe is helpful supplemental information in analyzing the performance of the business from period to period fiscal year in millions increase increase aerospace industrial energy consumer automotive medical total net sales the following table includes comparative information for our estimated net sales by the same principal end use markets  but excluding surcharge revenues fiscal year in millions increase increase aerospace industrial energy consumer automotive medical total net sales excluding surcharge revenues 
table of contents sales to the aerospace market increased percent from fiscal year to million 
excluding surcharge revenue  such sales increased percent on percent higher shipment volume 
aerospace results reflect continuing strong demand for engine components driven by high build rates 
industrial market sales increased percent from fiscal year to million 
adjusted for surcharge revenue  such sales increased approximately percent while volumes increased percent 
the results reflect the impact of mix management and pricing actions as well as demand growth for higher value materials for fittings 
in addition  powder metal sales used for tool steel products were up significantly 
sales to the energy market of million reflected a percent increase from the fiscal year excluding surcharge revenue  such sales increased percent on percent higher shipment volume 
the results reflect a significant increase in the oil and gas segment due in part to increases in directional drilling activity  the amega west acquisition and higher pricing 
in addition  increased demand for materials used in industrial gas turbines contributed to the growth 
sales to the consumer market increased percent to million from a year ago 
adjusted for surcharge revenue  such sales increased percent with shipment volume higher by percent 
revenue grew faster than volume as the growing global demand for higher value materials used in sporting goods applications outpaced sales of lower value materials used in housing 
mix management efforts and pricing actions are having a considerable positive impact on the consumer market sales 
automotive market sales increased percent from the fiscal year to million 
excluding surcharge revenue  such sales increased percent on percent higher shipment volume 
the revenue growth is attributable to mix management efforts that caused increased participation in higher value turbo charger and fuel system components  with a corresponding reduction in lower value products 
these efforts are expected to better position us to participate in the trend toward premium stainless and high temp alloys used in the next generation technologies that support higher fuel economy 
sales to the medical market increased percent to million from a year ago 
adjusted for surcharge revenue  such sales increased percent  on percent higher volume 
the results reflect increased demand particularly in our high end stainless products 
sales by product class the following table includes comparative information for our net sales by major product class fiscal year in millions increase increase special alloys stainless steels titanium products other materials total net sales 
table of contents the following table includes comparative information for our net sales by the same major product class  but excluding surcharge revenues fiscal year in millions increase increase special alloys stainless steels titanium products other materials total net sales excluding surcharge revenues sales of special alloys products increased percent in fiscal year as compared with a year ago to million 
excluding surcharge revenue  sales increased percent on a percent increase in shipment volume 
the sales results principally reflect the increase in demand from the higher value aerospace and energy market products 
sales of stainless steels increased percent as compared with a year ago 
excluding surcharge revenues  such sales increased by percent on a percent higher shipment volume 
the results reflect increased demand in materials used in the automotive  industrial and consumer markets as well as the impacts of pricing and mix management actions 
sales of titanium products increased percent as compared with a year ago on percent higher shipment volume 
the results reflect the impact of increased demand for titanium products used in the aerospace and medical end use markets 
gross profit gross profit in fiscal year increased to million  or percent of net sales percent of net sales excluding surcharges  from million  or percent of net sales percent of net sales excluding surcharges  a year ago 
the results primarily reflect the higher volumes in fiscal year  an improved product mix  price increases and better operating performance 
our surcharge mechanism is structured to recover increases in raw material costs  although generally with a lag effect 
while the surcharge generally protects the absolute gross profit dollars  it does have a dilutive effect on gross margin as a percent of sales 
the following represents a summary of the dilutive impact of the surcharges on gross margin for fiscal years and see the section non gaap financial measures below for further discussion of these financial metrics 
fiscal year in millions net sales less surcharge revenue net sales excluding surcharges gross profit gross margin gross margin excluding dilutive effect of surcharges 
table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal year were million  or percent of net sales percent of net sales excluding surcharges  compared to million  or percent of net sales percent of net sales excluding surcharges  in fiscal year the increase in fiscal year is principally related to higher compensation costs associated with increased headcount and the addition of amega west overhead costs 
acquisition related costs during fiscal year  we incurred million of acquisition related costs associated with the latrobe and amega west acquisitions 
these costs consist primarily of fees paid to financial  legal and other professional advisors in connection with the acquisition activities 
operating income our operating income in fiscal year increased to million as compared with million in fiscal year operating income has been significantly impacted by our pension earnings  interest and deferrals pension eid portion of our net pension expense  which may be volatile based on conditions in the financial markets 
the following presents our operating income and operating margin  in each case excluding the impact of surcharges on net sales and excluding the impacts of pension eid expense from operating income 
we present and discuss these financial measures because management believes removing the impact of volatile charges provides a more consistent and meaningful basis for comparing results of operations from period to period 
see the section non gaap financial measures below for further discussion of these financial measures 
fiscal year in millions net sales less surcharge revenue net sales excluding surcharges operating income add back pension eid expense operating income excluding pension eid expense operating margin excluding surcharges and pension eid expense in addition to the impact of the surcharge mechanism and pension eid expense  fluctuations in raw material prices combined with fluctuations in inventory levels and the lag effect of the surcharge mechanism have impacted our operating income from year to year 
we estimate that the effect of such combined fluctuations negatively impacted our operating margin by approximately basis points during fiscal year and negatively impacted our operating margin by approximately basis points during fiscal year 
table of contents interest expense fiscal year interest expense of million compared from million in fiscal year interest on substantially all of our debt was at a fixed rate 
we have used interest rate swaps to achieve a level of floating rate debt to fixed rate debt where appropriate 
fiscal year interest expense includes net gains from interest rate swaps of million as compared with net gains from the interest rate swaps of million in fiscal year the decrease in interest expense  excluding the gains on the interest swaps  is attributable to reductions in outstanding debt offset by decrease in the amount of interest capitalized associated with ongoing construction projects during fiscal year other income  net other income for fiscal year was million as compared with million a year ago 
the decrease principally reflected less receipts from the continued dumping and subsidy offset act of offset by favorable market return on company owned life insurance and higher equity in earnings from our joint ventures 
income taxes our effective tax rate income tax expense as a percent of income before taxes for fiscal year was percent as compared to percent in fiscal year the fiscal year tax rate was lower than the statutory rate of percent  primarily due to benefits associated with foreign source income  the domestic manufacturing deduction and the research and development credit 
the fiscal year tax rate was higher than the statutory rate of percent  primarily due to the following items 
we recorded an income tax expense charge in the amount of million to reduce the value of the company s deferred tax asset previously established for anticipated retiree health care liabilities 
offsetting this amount  there was a reduction in income tax expense in the amount of million due to the reversal of certain unrecognized tax benefits as a result of the completion of certain tax examinations 
our lower taxable income level also resulted in our permanent book to tax differences having a more significant impact on the effective tax rate
