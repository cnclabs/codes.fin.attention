introduction we offer property and casualty insurance products through our various subsidiaries 
we classify our businesses into two operating segments i insurance operations  which consists of commercial lines and personal lines  including our flood line of business and ii investments 
for further information on our segments see item business 
of this form k 
the purpose of the management s discussion and analysis md a is to provide an understanding of the consolidated results of operations and financial condition and known trends and uncertainties that may have a material impact in future periods 
in the md a  we will discuss and analyze the following critical accounting policies and estimates  financial highlights of results for years ended december    and  results of operations and related information by segment  federal income taxes  financial condition  liquidity  short term borrowings  and capital resources  off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations  contingent liabilities  and commitments  ratings  and pending accounting pronouncements 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have identified the policies and estimates described below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of the results of our operations 
our preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
those estimates that were most critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements involved the following i reserve for losses and loss expenses  ii deferred policy acquisition costs  iii premium audit  iv pension and post retirement benefit plan actuarial assumptions  v otti  and vi reinsurance 
reserves for losses and loss expenses significant periods of time can elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss  the reporting of the loss to the insurer  and the insurer s payment of that loss 
to recognize liabilities for unpaid losses and loss expenses  insurers establish reserves as balance sheet liabilities representing an estimate of amounts needed to pay reported and unreported net losses and loss expenses 
as of december   we had accrued billion of gross loss and loss expense reserves compared to billion at december  how reserves are established when a claim is reported to an insurance subsidiary  claims personnel establish a case reserve for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment 
the amount of the reserve is primarily based upon a case by case evaluation of the type of claim involved  the circumstances surrounding each claim  and the policy provisions relating to the type of losses 
the estimate reflects the informed judgment of such personnel based on their knowledge  experience  and general insurance reserving practices 
until the claim is resolved  these estimates are revised as deemed appropriate by the responsible claims personnel based on subsequent developments and periodic reviews of the case 
in addition to case reserves  we maintain estimates of reserves for losses and loss expenses that have been incurred but not reported to us referred to as ibnr 
using generally accepted actuarial reserving techniques  we project our estimate of ultimate losses and loss expenses at each reporting date 
the difference between i the projected ultimate loss and loss expense reserves  and ii the case loss reserves and the loss expenses reserved thereon is carried as the ibnr reserve 
the actuarial techniques used are part of a comprehensive reserving process that included two primary components 
the first component is a detailed quarterly reserve analysis performed by our internal actuarial staff 
in completing this analysis  the actuaries are required to make numerous assumptions including  for example  the selection of loss development factors and the weight to be applied to each individual actuarial indication 
these indications include paid and incurred versions for the following actuarial methodologies loss development  bornhuetter ferguson  berquist sherman  and frequency severity modeling 
additionally  the actuaries must gather substantially similar data in sufficient volume to ensure the statistical credibility of the data 
the second component of the analysis is the projection of the expected ultimate loss ratio for each line of business for the current accident year 
this projection is part of our planning process wherein we review and update expected loss ratios each quarter 
this review includes actual versus expected pricing changes  loss trend assumptions  and updated prior period loss ratios from the most recent quarterly reserve analysis 
in addition to the most recent loss trends  a range of possible ibnr reserves is determined annually and continually considered  among other factors  in establishing ibnr for each reporting period 
loss trends include  but are not limited to  large loss activity  environmental claim activity  large case reserve additions or reductions for prior accident years  and reinsurance recoverable issues 
we also consider factors such as i per claim information  ii company and industry historical loss experience  iii legislative enactments  judicial decisions  legal developments in the imposition of damages  and changes in political attitudes  and iv trends in general economic conditions  including the effects of inflation 
based on the consideration of the range of possible ibnr reserves  recent loss trends  uncertainty associated with actuarial assumptions and other factors  ibnr is established and the ultimate net liability for losses and loss expenses is determined 
such an assessment requires considerable judgment given that it is frequently not possible to determine whether a change in the data is an anomaly until some time after the event 
even if a change is determined to be permanent  it is not always possible to reliably determine the extent of the change until some time later 
there is no precise method for subsequently evaluating the impact of any specific factor on the adequacy of reserves because the eventual deficiency or redundancy is affected by many factors 
the changes in these estimates  resulting from the continuous review process and the differences between estimates and ultimate payments  are reflected in the consolidated statements of income for the period in which such estimates are changed 
any changes in the liability estimate may be material to the results of operations in future periods 
major trends by line of business creating additional loss and loss expense reserve uncertainty the insurance subsidiaries are multi state  multi line property and casualty insurance companies and  as such  are subject to reserve uncertainty stemming from a variety of sources 
these uncertainties are considered at each step in the process of establishing loss and loss expense reserves 
however  as market conditions change  certain trends are identified that management believes create an additional amount of uncertainty 
a discussion of recent trends  by line of business  that have been recognized by management follows 
general liability at december   our general liability line of business had recorded reserves  net of reinsurance of million  which represented of our total net reserves 
the broad nature of this coverage  and the longer tailed nature of the claims settlement process  makes this line more susceptible to changes in litigation and the tort environment 
this line of business also includes excess policies that provide additional limits above underlying automobile and general liability coverages  which is subject to catastrophic losses  and therefore influenced by the factors noted above to a greater degree 
while prior year development in recent years has been relatively minor  we have been growing the number of our commercial excess policies at a greater rate than the rest of our commercial lines of business  which could create additional volatility in our results 
in and  we have lowered the net retention of our reinsurance covering these policies  which should mitigate some of the potential volatility 
workers compensation at december   our workers compensation line of business recorded reserves  net of reinsurance  of million  or of our total net reserves 
in addition to the uncertainties associated with actuarial assumptions and methodologies described above  the workers compensation line of business can be impacted by a variety of issues such as unexpected changes in medical cost inflation  higher than anticipated claim severity  changes in overall economic conditions  and company specific initiatives 
from through  we experienced an unusual amount of volatility associated with our workers compensation medical costs 
in addition  uncertainty regarding future medical inflation creates the potential for additional volatility in our reserves 
in  overall economic conditions were extremely unstable 
high levels of unemployment could impact both the severity and frequency of our workers compensation claims 
there is also potential for an increase in severity if the longevity of workers compensation claims increase 
injured workers could have less incentive to return to work when their company is in financial distress or injured workers could be laid off while on workers compensation 
conversely  there is potential for a decrease in frequency if workers are reluctant to file claims or have less work and less exposure to injury 
additionally  the economy could impact the frequency and severity of claims in ways unanticipated by management 
in and  we have experienced an unusually high amount of audit activity  resulting in return premium of million and million  respectively  a trend which may continue into the future 
since premiums earned are used as a basis for setting initial reserves on the current accident year  our reserves could be impacted in ways not yet anticipated 
the result could be favorable development if the reduction in payroll is truly a reduction in exposure 
the result could be adverse development if the reduction in payroll indicates that remaining workers are now overworked and more prone to accidents 
finally  in the past few years  the company implemented a multi faceted workers compensation strategy which incorporated knowledge management and predictive modeling initiatives 
the ongoing impact of these initiatives is a potential source of uncertainty in the future 
if the ongoing impact of these strategies exceeds our expectations  the result could be favorable development in the future 
if our internal strategies are less effective than anticipated  and we experience higher than expected claim severity  the result could be adverse development in the future 
commercial automobile at december   our commercial automobile line of business had recorded reserves  net of reinsurance  of million  which represented of our total net reserves 
this line of business experienced favorable prior year loss development from through  which was driven by a downward trend in frequency of large claims 
the number of large claims has a high degree of volatility from year to year  and therefore  requires a longer period before true trends are recognized and can be acted upon 
while management has not identified any specific trends related to this line  the volatility of large claims creates additional uncertainty in our analysis for the most recent accident years 
workers compensation  general liability and commercial automobile impact of claims initiatives and inflation in addition to the line of business specific issues mentioned above  these lines of business have been impacted by a number of initiatives undertaken by our claims department that have resulted in volatility in the average case reserves 
this change in the average level of case reserves increases the uncertainty in the short run  but the longer term benefit is a more refined management of the claims process 
additionally  inflationary changes are perceived to be more likely in the current economic environment 
uncertainty regarding future inflation or deflation creates the potential for additional volatility in our reserves for both of these lines of business 
personal automobile at december   our personal automobile line of business had recorded reserves  net of reinsurance  of million  which represented of our total net reserves 
the majority of the reserves are from business written in new jersey 
over the past several years we have been decreasing the amount of business written in new jersey while increasing the amount of business written in other states 
we review the reserves for states other than new jersey on a combined basis so that there is a sufficient volume of data to ensure statistical credibility 
however  the state mix of business changes over time  which may increase the uncertainty surrounding our personal automobile reserves 
other lines of business at december   no other individual line of business had recorded reserves of more than million  net of reinsurance 
we have not identified any recent trends that would create additional significant reserve uncertainty for these other lines of business 
the following tables provide case and ibnr reserves for losses and loss expense  and reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss expenses as of december  and as of december  reinsurance recoverable on unpaid loss and loss expense reserves losses and case ibnr loss in thousands reserves reserves total expenses net reserves commercial automobile workers compensation general liability commercial property business owners policies bonds other total commercial lines personal automobile homeowners other total personal lines total as of december  reinsurance recoverable on unpaid loss and loss expense reserves losses and case ibnr loss in thousands reserves reserves total expenses net reserves commercial automobile workers compensation general liability commercial property business owners policies bonds other total commercial lines personal automobile homeowners other total personal lines total range of reasonable reserves we established a range of reasonably possible reserves for net claims of approximately  million to  million at december  and  million to  million at december  a low and high reasonable reserve selection was derived primarily by considering the range of indications calculated using generally accepted actuarial techniques 
such techniques assume that past experience  adjusted for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends  are an appropriate basis for predicting future events 
although this range reflects likely scenarios  it is possible that the final outcomes may fall above or below these amounts 
based on internal stochastic modeling  we believe that a reasonable estimate of the likelihood that the final outcome falls within the current range is approximately 
this range does not include a provision for potential increases or decreases associated with environmental reserves 
our best estimate is consistent with the actuarial central estimate 
we do not discount to present value that portion of our loss reserves expected to be paid in future periods  however  the loss reserves take into account anticipated recoveries for salvage and subrogation claims 
sensitivity analysis potential impact on reserve volatility due to changes in key assumptions our process to establish reserves includes a variety of key assumptions  including  but not limited to  the following the selection of loss development factors  the weight to be applied to each individual actuarial indication  projected future loss trends  and expected ultimate loss ratios for the current accident year 
the importance of any single assumption depends on several considerations  such as the line of business and the accident year 
if the actual experience emerges differently than the assumptions used in the process to establish reserves  changes in our reserve estimate are possible and may be material to the results of operations in future periods 
set forth below is a discussion of the potential impact of using certain key assumptions that differ from those used in our latest reserve analysis 
it is important to note that the following discussion considers each assumption individually  without any consideration of correlation between lines of business and accident years  and therefore  does not constitute an actuarial range 
while the following discussion represents possible volatility from variations in key assumptions as identified by management  there is no assurance that the future emergence of our loss experience will be consistent with either our current or alternative set of assumptions 
by the very nature of the insurance business  loss development patterns have a certain amount of normal volatility 
general liability in addition to the normal amount of volatility  general liability loss development factors have greater uncertainty due to the complexity of the coverages and the possibly significant periods of time that can elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss  the reporting of the loss to the insurer  and the insurer s payment of that loss 
in our judgment  it is possible that general liability loss development factors could be from those actually selected in our latest reserve analysis 
if the loss development assumptions were changed by  that would increase decrease our indicated general liability reserves by approximately million for accident years and prior 
workers compensation in addition to the normal amount of volatility  the combination of the sensitivity of workers compensation results to medical inflation  economic conditions including unemployment  and changes in underwriting could lead to actual experience emerging differently than the assumptions used in the process to establish reserves 
in our judgment  it is possible that actual medical loss development factors could range from below to above those selected in our latest reserve analysis and expected loss ratios could range from below to above those selected in our latest reserve analysis 
the combination of reducing the assumptions for medical loss development by and the expected loss ratio by could decrease our indicated workers compensation reserves by approximately million for accident years and prior 
alternatively  the combination of increasing the medical loss development factors by and the expected loss ratio by could increase our indicated workers compensation reserves by approximately million for accident years and prior 
commercial automobile in addition to the normal amount of volatility  our commercial automobile line of business has realized significant favorable development in through this favorable development was driven in large part by a reduction in our bodily injury loss experience 
the actual number of large claims has a high degree of volatility from year to year in terms of timing and ultimate final emergence 
even if large losses are ultimately consistent from year to year  if they are identified at different times than previous years  traditional loss development factors may overstate or understate actuarial indications 
if the timing of large losses is significantly variable  it is our judgment that actual loss development factors could be different from those selected in our reserve review  which would increase decrease our indicated commercial auto reserves by approximately million for accident years and prior 
claims initiatives impact on workers compensation  general liability  and commercial automobile as discussed in the major trend section above  the claims initiatives and inflationary uncertainty could impact reserves for the workers compensation  general liability  and commercial automobile lines of business 
in our judgment  it is possible that the selected reserves for these lines of business in our latest reserve review could increase by million or decrease by million due to the combination of case reserve volatility in accident years through and unexpected inflation or deflation 
these potential impacts would likely manifest themselves as changes in development patterns and expected loss ratios as described within the discussions of the separate lines of business 
therefore  these impacts may be embedded within the line of business figures  in whole or in part 
personal automobile in addition to a normal amount of volatility  the uncertainty of personal automobile loss development factors is greater than usual due to the change in our state mix for business written in states other than new jersey 
in our judgment  it is possible that personal auto bodily injury loss development factors could be different from those selected in our reserve review 
this would increase decrease our indicated personal auto reserves by approximately million for accident years and prior 
current accident year for the accident year  the expected ultimate loss ratio by line of business is a key assumption 
this assumption is based upon a large number of inputs that are assessed periodically  such as historical loss ratios  projected future loss trend  and planned pricing amounts 
in our judgment  it is possible that the actual ultimate loss ratio for the accident year could be from the one selected in our latest reserve analysis for the combination of our four major long tailed lines of business 
the table below summarizes the possible impact on our reserves of varying our expected loss ratio assumption by by line of business for the accident year 
reserve impact of changing current year expected ultimate loss ratio assumption in millions if assumption was reduced by if assumption was raised by workers compensation general liability commercial automobile liability personal automobile liability combined prior year reserve development in light of the many uncertainties associated with establishing the estimates and making the assumptions necessary to establish reserve levels  we review our reserve estimates on a regular basis as described above and make adjustments in the period that the need for such adjustment is determined 
these reviews could result in the identification of information and trends that would require us to increase some reserves and or decrease other reserves for prior periods and could also lead to additional increases in loss and loss adjustment expense reserves  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  equity  business  insurer financial strength  and debt ratings 
in  we experienced overall favorable loss development of approximately million 
this was driven by favorable emergence in accident years and prior of approximately million  partially offset by unfavorable emergence in accident years and of approximately million 
in  we experienced favorable loss development of approximately million in accident years through partially offset by unfavorable loss development in the accident year  as well as accident years prior to  of approximately million  netting to favorable prior year development of million 
in  we experienced favorable loss development in accident years and prior of approximately million partially offset by unfavorable loss development in accident year of approximately million  netting to total favorable prior year development of approximately million
