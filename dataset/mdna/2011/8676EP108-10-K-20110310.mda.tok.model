january  k critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  related revenues and expenses  and disclosure of gain and loss contingencies at the date of the financial statements 
the estimates and assumptions made require us to exercise our judgment and are based on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we continually evaluate the information that forms the basis of our estimates and assumptions as our business and the business environment generally changes 
the use of estimates is pervasive throughout our financial statements 
the following are the accounting estimates which we believe to be most important to our business 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue at the time of delivery of the product or service and when all of the following have occurred a sales agreement is in place  price is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
consideration given to customers such as value incentives  rebates  early payment discounts and other discounts are recorded as reductions to revenues at the time of sale 
accounts receivable our accounts receivable primarily includes amounts due from our customers 
the carrying value of each account is carefully monitored with a view to assessing the likelihood of collection 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is provided for as an estimate of losses that could result from customers defaulting on their obligation to us 
in assessing the amount of reserve required  a number of factors are considered including the age of the account  the credit worthiness of the customer  payment terms  the customer s historical payment history and general economic conditions 
because the amount of the reserve is an estimate  the actual amount collected could differ from the carrying value of the amount receivable 
note of the consolidated financial statements provides an analysis of the changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventory inventory is our largest current asset 
our inventory consists primarily of raw materials and finished goods held for sale 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost  valued on a weighted average cost basis  or estimated net realizable value except certain grain inventories that are carried at market value 
depending on market conditions  the actual amount received on sale could differ from our estimated value of inventory when provisions to record inventory at market are necessary 
in order to determine the value of inventory at the balance sheet date  we evaluate a number of factors to determine the adequacy of provisions for inventory 
the factors include the age of inventory  the amount of inventory held by type  future demand for products and the expected future selling price we expect to realize by selling the inventory 
our estimates are judgmental in nature and are made at a point in time  using available information  expected business plans and expected market conditions 
we perform a review of our inventory by reporting unit and product line on a quarterly basis 
note of the consolidated financial statements provides an analysis of the movements in inventory reserve 
prepaid and other current assets prepaid and other current assets include amounts paid in cash and recorded as a current asset prior to consumption 
the balance also includes advances to growers required to secure future delivery of product net of provisions 
an allowance against realizing these advances is recorded when it is determined that we will not recover the advances  due to default on scheduled repayment terms  or general economic or market conditions 
advances to growers are typically made at the start of the growing season 
we monitor our advances to growers by monitoring adherence to agreed upon terms as well as evaluating general economic and market conditions  and assessing the status of the crops being grown in order to determine if the collection of the advance is at risk 
impairment testing of goodwill with the implementation of financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic formerly statement of financial accounting standard no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life are no longer amortized  but instead are tested at least annually for impairment 
any impairment loss is recognized in income 
sunopta inc 
january  k in accordance with asc  we evaluate goodwill for impairment on a reporting unit basis 
reporting units are operating segments or components of operating segments for which discrete financial information is available 
to evaluate goodwill  the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value 
where the carrying value is greater than the fair value  the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit with any remainder being allocated to goodwill 
the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is then compared to the carrying value of that goodwill to determine whether an impairment loss exists 
we measure the fair value of reporting units using discounted cash flows 
because the business is assumed to continue in perpetuity  the discounted future cash flow includes a terminal value 
the first year or base year in the calculation of the discounted cash flow model is based on actual results in each component  adjusted for unusual and non recurring items 
future years cash flows to perpetuity are forecasted based on projected revenue growth  and our planned business strategies in future periods that would impact actual cash flows reported in the base year 
examples of planned strategies would include a plant or line expansion at an existing facility  a reduction of working capital at a specific location  and price increases or cost reductions within business units 
the revenue growth and planned business strategies for future periods incorporated into the discounted cash flow model reflect our long term view of the market 
the discount rate is based on a segment s targeted weighted average cost of capital  which is not necessarily the same as our weighted average cost of capital 
these assumptions are subject to change and are also impacted by our ability to achieve our forecasts and by economic conditions which may impact future results and result in projections not being attained 
each year we re evaluate the assumptions used to reflect changes in the business environment 
during the third quarter of  we determined that there were external market conditions and other circumstances that suggested the carrying value of the natural health products reporting unit  which is part of the international foods segment  may exceed its fair value 
these external market conditions and other circumstances included reduced sales levels  increased competition leading to price concessions and decreased market share  shift in product mix causing lower gross margins  and product de listing at certain retailers 
as a result of completing the test for goodwill impairment  we determined that the carrying value of goodwill in our natural health reporting unit exceeded its fair value  and recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of  the rest of the annual goodwill impairment test for the year ended january  indicated that the fair value of the grains and foods group  the ingredients group and the organic corporation a reporting unit within the international foods group exceeded their carrying values  and as a result  no impairment charges were recorded 
during the year ended december   opta minerals determined that there were external market conditions and other circumstances that suggested the carrying value of certain reporting units in opta minerals may exceed their fair value 
these external market conditions and other circumstances included continued operating losses and extended periods of facility under utilization due to continued weakness in the steel  abrasives and foundry markets 
as a result of completing a test for goodwill impairment  opta minerals determined that the carrying value of goodwill in certain of its mill and foundry and abrasive products reporting units exceeded their fair value  and recorded a non cash impairment charge of  also during the year ended december   we determined that the increase in goodwill as a result of contingent consideration in the fruit group resulted in the carrying value of the group exceeding its fair value 
as a result  we recorded a charge to the consolidated statement of operations 
note of the consolidated financial statements provides a summary of the critical assumptions used in the annual impairment test 
purchase price allocation business acquisitions are accounted for by the purchase method of accounting 
under this method  the purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on the fair value at the time of the acquisition 
any excess purchase price over the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities acquired is recorded as goodwill 
the assumptions and estimates with respect to determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired generally requires the most judgment  and include estimates of future profitability  and or customer and supplier based attrition  income tax rates and discount rates 
changes in any of the assumptions or estimates used in determining the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities could impact the amounts assigned to assets  liabilities and goodwill in the purchase price allocation 
future net earnings can be affected as a result of changes in these estimates resulting in an asset or goodwill impairment 
further  amortization periods are subjective based on expected useful lives and chosen rates 
in accordance with asc  business combinations  all costs incurred related to the acquisitions completed during fiscal were charged to the consolidated statement of operations 
note of the consolidated financial statements provide information with respect to businesses acquired and note outlines annual amortization expense relating to these intangibles 
sunopta inc 
january  k accrued expenses and other assets we make estimates of future payments and receipts which relate to current and future accounting periods 
these estimates cover items such as accrued but unpaid wages and bonuses  estimates of taxes and estimates of amounts payable or receivable under legal suits 
in establishing appropriate accruals and receivable balances  we must make judgments regarding the amount of the disbursement or receipts that will ultimately be incurred or received 
in making such assessments  we use historical experience as well as any other special circumstances surrounding a particular item 
the actual amount paid or received could differ from our estimates 
income taxes we are liable for income taxes in the united states  canada  and other jurisdictions where we operate 
our effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate and will vary from year to year primarily as a result of numerous permanent differences  investment and other tax credits  the provision for income taxes at different rates in foreign and other provincial jurisdictions  enacted statutory tax rate increases or reductions in the year  the benefit of cross jurisdictional financing structures  changes due to foreign exchange  changes in valuation allowance based on our recoverability assessments of deferred tax assets  and favourable or unfavourable resolution of various tax examinations 
in making an estimate of our income tax liability  we first assess which items of income and expense are taxable in a particular jurisdiction 
this process involves a determination of the amount of taxes currently payable as well as the assessment of the effect of temporary timing differences resulting from different treatment of items for accounting and tax purposes 
these differences in the timing of the recognition of income or the deductibility of expenses result in deferred income tax balances that are recorded as assets or liabilities as the case may be on our balance sheet 
we also estimate the amount of valuations allowance to maintain relating to loss carry forwards and other balances that can be used to reduce future taxes payable 
this judgment is based on forecasted results in the jurisdiction and certain tax planning strategies and as a result actual results may differ from forecasts 
we assess the likelihood of the ultimate realization of these tax assets by looking at the relative size of the tax assets in relation to the profitability of the businesses and the jurisdiction to which they can be applied to  the number of years based on management s estimate it will take to use the tax assets and any other special circumstances 
if different judgments had been used  our income tax liability could have been different from the amount recorded 
in addition  the taxing authorities of those jurisdictions upon audit may not agree with our assessment 
note of the consolidated financial statements provides an analysis of the changes in the valuation allowance and the components of our deferred tax assets 
in june  the fasb issued asc topic formerly interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 

asc clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
while we believe we have adequately provided for all tax positions  amounts asserted by taxing authorities could differ from accrued position 
accordingly  additional provisions on federal  provincial  state and foreign tax related matters could be recorded in the future as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved 
stock compensation we maintain a stock option plan under which incentive stock options may be granted to employees and non employee directors 
effective january   asc formerly sfas no 
r share based payments requires that we record stock based compensation expenses within the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive earnings loss 
at each grant date  we are required to estimate a number of inputs  such as the estimated life of the option and the forfeiture rate used in the black scholes model to determine a fair value for the options granted to employees or non employee directors 
once determined at the grant date  fair value of the stock award is recorded over the vesting period of the options granted

excluding the impact of foreign exchange and commodity related price movements  revenues increased approximately over the prior year 
the acquisition of dahlgren company  inc and edner of nevada  inc

for the year ended january   we experienced increased gross profit in all of our operating segments 
within sunopta foods  higher volumes of fiber  fruit ingredient products  grains  consumer products and plant efficiencies all contributed to the increased gross profit 
also contributing to the increase in gross profit was a rebound in the steel and abrasive markets for opta minerals 
the improvement in gross profit was due primarily to a lower overall cost of goods sold  as a percentage of revenues  as a result of the variances described below under segmented operations information 
warehouse and distribution w d costs for the year ended january  were  a decrease compared to  for the year ended december  these costs are solely related to the international foods group and specifically the group s canadian based natural health products operation as warehousing and distribution costs for all other operations are considered part of cost of goods sold 
selling  general and administrative costs sg a including intangible asset amortization increased  to  for the year ended january  compared to  for the year ended december  the combination of a stronger canadian dollar and a weaker euro for the year ended january  led to a  increase in sg a on foreign denominated costs

during the year ended january   we recognized gains and recorded specific expenses against net earnings that we do not believe are reflective of normal business operations 
as a result  we believe it is useful to eliminate these gains and expenses to compute an adjusted net earnings per share amount for the year ended january  which we believe is more reflective of normal business operations 
during the year ended january   we recorded gains on the sales of the canadian food distribution assets and the sale of sunopta bioprocess inc see note 
losses from discontinued operations  net of income taxes  include costs incurred as a result of the sales including stock based and other compensation rewards that were triggered upon closing of the sales  severances and mandatory interest payments 
we also executed a restructuring plan at our natural health products operation as a result of market conditions and the sale of the canadian food distribution assets  which triggered severance costs 
as a result of its dilution in ownership in an investment prior to being sold  sunopta bioprocess recorded a non taxable dilution gain in the second quarter of we also recorded asset write downs relating to property  plant and equipment and intangible assets within the fruit group  recognized a goodwill impairment charge relating to our natural health products division  and reversed a tax valuation allowance relating to a tax position that is no longer uncertain 
in addition  we incurred professional  legal and other costs related to our fourth quarter of acquisitions of dahlgren company  inc and the assets of edner of nevada inc  as well as non cash compensation related to cancelled stock options at our less than wholly owned subsidiary 
we believe that earnings attributable to sunopta inc is the performance measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap that is most directly comparable to adjusted earnings from operations  and that earnings per share is the performance measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap that is most directly comparable to adjusted net earnings per share 
the table above reconciles earnings attributable to sunopta inc to adjusted earnings from operations and reconciles earnings per share to adjusted net earnings per share  in each case for the year ended january  adjusted net earnings per share and adjusted earnings from operations are non gaap financial measures 
we believe these non gaap measures  which have been adjusted for the impact of the items listed in the table above  assist investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance 
adjusted net earnings per share and adjusted earnings from operations should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with gaap

these expenses are allocated to the groups based on specific identification of allocable costs that represent a service provided to each divisions  and a proportionate distribution of costs based on a weighting of factors such as revenue contribution and number of people employed within each division 
as a result of the sale of the canadian food distribution business and sunopta bioprocess  a portion of the corporate management fees previously charged to these groups was reallocated as an expense of the corporate services operating segment

january  k liquidity and capital resources we obtain our short term financing through a combination of cash generated from operating activities  cash and cash equivalents  and available operating lines of credit 
at january   we have availability under certain lines of credit of approximately  december  
on december   we completed amendments to our syndicated banking facilities  which modified our canadian and us lines of credit  as well as our long term debt 
with respect to the line of credit facilities  availability under the canadian line of credit was reduced from cdn  to cdn  to reflect the sale of the canadian food distribution assets noted above 
offsetting this decrease was an increase to our us line of credit from  to  to reflect the concentration of syndicate operations currently located in the united states 
in addition to the above changes  an accordion feature was added to the lines of credit for up to an additional  of total availability to support internal growth and acquisition  subject to credit approval by the existing syndicate bankers or a new bank

cash flows generated from operating activities 
cash flows generated from exercise of options which may be in the money during the year 
additional long term financing 
sale of non core divisions  or assets 
in order to finance significant acquisitions that may arise in the future  we may need additional sources of cash that we could attempt to obtain through a combination of additional bank or subordinated financing  a private or public offering  or the issuance of common stock in relation to an acquisition or a divestiture 
there can be no assurance that such financing would be available or  if so  on terms that are acceptable to us 
included in cash and cash equivalents at january  is december  that is specific to opta minerals that cannot be utilized by the company for general corporate purposes  and is maintained in separate bank accounts of opta minerals

sunopta inc 
january  k cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations generated  during fiscal  an improvement of  compared to cash generated of  during fiscal this improvement in cash provided by operating activities was due a  reduction in non cash working capital in the primary area of improvement in cash used to fund working capital was a reduction of  in cash used to fund inventories 
this was consistent with company wide objectives to reduce inventory levels  resulting in a decrease from  at december  to  at december  in particular  the international foods group saw a reduction of  or approximately in inventory balances  as the group sold through the prior year s harvests  and focused on reducing inventories on hand and controlling the purchase of raw materials

see forward looking statements 
management believes that consumer demand for high quality natural and organic foods and natural health products has grown rapidly over the past decade as global awareness of the benefits of healthy eating continues to proliferate 
the global market for organic foods is currently estimated by management to be in excess of billion with historical growth rates between and depending on product line and country 
despite growth rates stalling during the most recent economic downturn  the long term trends for growth remain in place 
while a large number of companies compete within specific segments of the market  we believe there are relatively few companies as well positioned as sunopta to take advantage of this growing market 
we believe that our vertically integrated seed to table business model built over the past eleven years has positioned sunopta as a global leader in the natural and organic foods and natural health products markets 
for we believe we will realize revenue and unit growth compared to  resulting from new product offerings  new and expanding customer relationships and incremental sales of confection sunflower products and nutritious portable foods as a result of our recent acquisitions of dahlgren company  inc and edner of nevada  inc 
we believe that consumers will continue to focus on health conscious natural  organic and specialty foods and natural health products as concerns over disease  obesity and well being are center of mind and we feel sunopta is well positioned to meet the needs of these growing markets 
sunopta inc 
january  k we believe that our net earnings for will improve versus excluding the positive impact of the sale of the canadian food distribution assets and sunopta bioprocess inc in as a result of improved volumes  pricing and product mix  increased capacity  cost reduction and rationalization initiatives  many of which have now been implemented  fixed cost leverage  and the avoidance of certain goodwill and asset impairment charges recorded in which are not expected to reoccur in our primary focus for remains the improvement of operating margins and returns on assets employed 
consistent with  as a direct result of continually changing world wide macroeconomic conditions  we have decided to take a cautious and responsible approach with regard to providing guidance  and in doing so  will not provide specific revenue and net earnings guidance for at this time 
our overall objective of realizing profitable growth through an effective balance of internal growth and acquisitions in support of our vertically integrated seed to table strategy remains unchanged 
the acquisition side of our growth strategy is back on track following our fourth quarter acquisitions of dahlgren company inc and edner of nevada  inc we continue to look for ways to exploit strategic synergies across sunopta foods  vertically integrating wherever possible 
initiatives to improve the productivity of operations include our performance excellence through people programs  product rationalization  plant and warehouse rationalization programs  continued training and development of employees  consolidated procurement  supply chain and internal services programs and consolidated information and accounting systems to provide better analysis and timely decision making 
a more fulsome discussion of key strategies is included in item of this report 
maintaining liquidity and having available sources of cash will be imperative to continue our growth 
at january  we had  in cash  of which may only be used within opta minerals inc we also had approximately  in unused bank lines for a total of  in cash and borrowings available 
our remaining cash and unused lines plus cash generated from operations are expected to be sufficient to finance capital spending estimated to be  to  debt service of  and payment of the current portion of long term liabilities of we believe additional sources of cash could be obtained through a combination of additional bank or subordinated financing  a private or public offering  the issuance of shares or through a divestiture 
however  there can be no assurance that such financing or transactions would be available or  if so  on terms that are acceptable to us 
off balance sheet arrangements there are currently no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition 
contractual obligations the table a below sets out our contractual obligations with respect to long term debt  operating and capital leases including interest costs  commitments to purchase grains  commodity and foreign exchange derivative contracts and long term liabilities  at january  contractual obligations total payments due by period thereafter long term debt obligations capital lease obligations grain purchase commitments other commitments operating leases interest on long term debt commodity and foreign exchange contracts long term liabilities interest rate swap a this table does not include certain contingent consideration related to acquisitions completed prior to december  that may become payable if predetermined profit targets are achieved 
as a result of adopting asc topic on business combinations  contingent consideration on the acquisitions completed in has been estimated as of the purchase date  and are reflected in the table above

january  k b interest is calculated based on scheduled repayments over the periods as indicated  using existing interest rates at january   as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk all financial numbers presented in this item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk are expressed in thousands of us dollars  unless otherwise noted 
interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and limit risk 
to achieve this objective  we may invest in a variety of securities  including both government and corporate obligations and money market funds 
these securities are generally classified as cash and cash equivalents or short term investments and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income 
as at january  all of sunopta s excess funds were held in cash and cash equivalents with a maturity less than days 
debt in both fixed rate and floating rate interest carry different types of interest rate risk 
fixed rate debt may have its fair market value adversely affected by a decline in interest rates 
in general  longer date debts are subject to greater interest rate risk than shorter dated securities 
floating rate term debt gives less predictability to cash flows as interest rates change 
as at january   the weighted average interest rate of our fixed rate term debt was december  and  december   of the company s outstanding term debt is at fixed interest rates 
variable rate term debt of  december   at an interest rate of december  is partially hedged by variable rate cash equivalent investments 
the company looks at varying factors to determine the percentage of debt to hold at fixed rates including the interest rate spread between variable and fixed swap rates  the company s view on interest rate trends  the percent of offset to variable rate debt through holding variable rate investments and the company s ability to manage with interest rate volatility and uncertainty 
for every increase decrease in interest rates on variable rate term debt the company s after tax earnings would decrease increase by approximately december  opta minerals entered into a cash flow hedge in at inception  the fair value of the cash flow hedge was determined to be a loss of using mark to market valuations which required an immediate expense of the ineffective portion 
the cash flow hedge entered into exchanged a notional amount of cdn  us  from a floating rate to a fixed rate of from august to august the fair value of the hedging derivative is estimated based on the standard swap valuation methodology 
the estimated fair value of the interest rate swap at december  was a loss of december  loss of 
the incremental gain in fair value of  net of income taxes of  has been recorded in other comprehensive loss for the period 
foreign currency risk all us subsidiaries use the us dollar as their functional currency and the us dollar is also our reporting currency 
the functional currency of all operations located in canada is the canadian dollar  except for opta minerals  which uses the us dollar as its functional currency 
the functional currency of all operations located in europe is the euro 
for these operations  all transaction gains or losses in relation to the us dollar are recorded as foreign exchange gain loss in the consolidated statements of operations while gains losses on translation of net assets to us dollars on consolidation are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders equity 
the functional currency of the corporate head office is the us dollar 
for the corporate office  transaction gains or losses as well as translation gains and losses on monetary assets and liabilities are recorded within foreign exchange on the consolidated statements of operations 
sunopta inc 
january  k we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of sunopta and its canadian and european subsidiaries are translated into us dollars on consolidation 
the canadian dollar depreciated relative to the us dollar in  with closing rates moving from cdn at december  to cdn at january  for each us dollar 
the euro depreciated against the us dollar during  with closing rates moving from at december  to at january  as a result of the depreciation of the canadian dollar and the sale of canadian denominated assets to unfi  and the depreciation of the euro against the us dollar during  we had a decrease of  december  a decrease of  in net canadian assets and increase of december  increase of in net euro 
a movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates in favour of against the canadian dollar or euro with all other variables held constant would result in an increase decrease in the fair value of our net assets by  december   for a canadian dollar exchange movement and  december   for a euro exchange movement 
sunopta foods operations based in the us have limited exposure to other currencies since almost all sales and purchases are made in us dollars 
the canadian based subsidiaries have significant transaction exposure as their sales are predominantly in canadian dollars while a substantial portion of their purchases are in us dollars 
the european operations are also exposed to various currencies as they purchase product from a wide variety of countries in several currencies and primarily sell into the european market 
it is the company s intention to hold excess funds in the currency in which the funds are likely to be used  which will from time to time potentially expose the company to exchange rate fluctuations when converted into us dollars 
we enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to reduce exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
open forward foreign exchange contracts were marked to market at january   resulting in a gain of december  gain of  which is included in foreign exchange on the consolidated statements of operations 
in  we began taking a more active role in an attempt to reduce exposure to foreign currency exchange rates by entering into forward foreign exchange contracts 
the contracts entered into are primarily canadian dollars and us dollars as well as us dollars and euros 
the net effect of all exchange based transactions including realized foreign exchange contracts  unrealized open contracts and all other foreign exchange transactions including the translation gains and losses related to our corporate net monetary assets are recorded in foreign exchange on our consolidated statements of operations 
for the year ended january   we recorded a gain of  december  a gain of 
commodity risk sunopta foods enters into exchange traded commodity futures and options contracts to hedge its exposure to price fluctuations on grain and certain other commodity transactions to the extent considered practicable for minimizing risk from market price fluctuations 
futures contracts used for hedging purposes are purchased and sold through regulated commodity exchanges 
inventories  however  may not be completely hedged  due in part to the company s assessment of its exposure from expected price fluctuations 
exchange purchase and sales contracts may expose the company to risk in the event that a counterparty to a transaction is unable to fulfill its contractual obligation 
the company manages its risk by entering into purchase contracts with pre approved growers 
the company has a risk of loss from hedge activity if a grower does not deliver as scheduled 
sales contracts are entered into with organizations of acceptable creditworthiness  as internally evaluated 
all futures transactions are marked to market 
gains and losses on futures transactions related to grain inventories are included in cost of goods sold 
at january  the company owned  december   bushels of corn with a weighted average price of december  and  december   bushels of soy beans with a weighted average price of december  
at january   the company has a net long position on soy beans of  december   and a net long position on corn of  december   bushels 
an increase decrease in commodity prices of either soy or corn of would result in an increase decrease in carrying value of these commodities by december  
in addition  the international foods group hedges the purchase of cocoa to minimize price fluctuations 
other than noted above  there are no futures contracts in the other sunopta foods segments  opta minerals or related to corporate office activities
