item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations economic environment since the second half of  the national economy has been in a recessionary mode and the rate of unemployment has exceeded 
while the economy in massachusetts and  in particular  the greater boston metropolitan area has remained relatively stable  unemployment nonetheless rose to levels not seen in over the past thirty years 
the deterioration in the economy made it difficult for some of the company loan customers to make their loan payments and  as a result  the company experienced loan losses that were higher than historic levels  particularly in its auto and eastern loan portfolios 
while there have been signs recently that the economy has started to gradually improve  we expect the operating environment in to remain challenging 
the volume of loan originations and loan losses will depend  to a large extent  on how the economy functions 
loan and deposit growth is also greatly influenced by the rate setting actions of the federal open market committee the fomc of the federal reserve system 
the fomc lowered the rate for 
table of contents overnight federal fund borrowings between banks dramatically from in september to a target range between zero and in december  the rate currently in effect 
in and  the unusually low interest rate environment had a significant effect on deposit flows and yields earned on investments and loans 
rising rates in the future could cause changes in the mix and volume of the company deposits and make it more difficult for certain borrowers to be eligible for new loans or to service their existing debt 
critical accounting policies the accounting policies described below are considered critical to understanding our financial condition and operating results 
such accounting policies are considered to be especially important because they involve a higher degree of complexity and require management to make difficult and subjective judgments which often require assumptions or estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
the use of different judgments  assumptions and estimates could result in material differences in our operating results or financial condition 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents management estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
additions to the allowance are made through provisions for loan losses charged to operating earnings 
loan losses are charged off in the period loans  or portions thereof  are deemed uncollectible 
the determination of the loans on which full collectibility is not reasonably assured  the estimates of the fair value of the underlying collateral and the assessment of economic and other conditions are subject to assumptions and judgments by management 
valuation allowances could differ materially as a result of changes in  or different interpretations of  these assumptions and judgments 
management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance on a quarterly basis and reviews its conclusion as to the amount to be established with the executive committee and the audit committee 
the executive committee is comprised of four independent directors of the board of directors and the audit committee is comprised of four other independent directors 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere herein for additional information on how management determines the balance of the allowance for loan losses for each segment and class of loans 
goodwill impairment goodwill is presumed to have an indefinite useful life and is tested at least annually for impairment 
impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
if fair value exceeds the carrying amount at the time of testing  goodwill is not considered impaired 
quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value and are considered to be used as the basis for measurement  when available 
other acceptable valuation methods include present value measurements based on multiples of earnings or revenues  or similar performance measures 
differences in valuation techniques could result in materially different evaluations of impairment 
goodwill impairment testing was performed for the company and eastern funding 
the annual goodwill impairment test of the company was performed as of november   using the quoted market price of the company common stock as of that date 
on that basis  we determined that the fair value of the company was in excess of its carrying value 
we also performed our annual goodwill impairment test of eastern funding as of november  due to the absence of a quoted market price  the following factors were evaluated to determine whether the goodwill related to eastern funding had been impaired eastern funding operating 
table of contents performance since our acquisition of a controlling interest in april  the soundness of eastern funding business fundamentals  eastern funding projected operating results for the next five years  the acquisition premium that a willing buyer would have to pay for the company to recover its investment in eastern funding and the present value of projected cash flows 
based on our evaluation of those factors  we concluded there was no indication of goodwill impairment 
investment securities securities classified as available for sale are carried at estimated fair value  with any unrealized gains and losses  net of taxes  reported as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in stockholders equity 
debt securities that we have the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and are carried at amortized cost 
the market values of our securities  particularly our fixed rate securities  are affected by changes in market interest rates 
in general  as interest rates rise  the market value of fixed rate securities will decrease  as interest rates fall  the market value of fixed rate securities will increase 
on a quarterly basis  we review and evaluate fair value based on market data obtained from independent sources or  in the absence of active market data  from model derived valuations based on market assumptions 
if we deem any decline to be other than temporary  the amount of impairment loss recorded in earnings for a debt security is the entire difference between the security cost and its fair value if we intend to sell the debt security prior to recovery or it is more likely than not that we will have to sell the debt security prior to recovery 
if  however  we do not intend to sell the debt security or we conclude that it is more likely than not that we will not have to sell the debt security prior to recovery  the credit loss component of an other than temporary impairment of a debt security is recognized as a charge to earnings and the remaining portion of the impairment loss is recognized as a reduction in comprehensive income 
the credit loss component of an other than temporary loss is determined based on our best estimate of cash flows expected to be collected 
impairment losses charged to earnings in  and were   and  respectively 
financial condition the company financial condition as of december   december  and december  included the following highlights loan growth excluding deferred loan origination costs of million in and million in deposit growth excluding brokered deposits of million in and million in non performing assets of million of total assets at december  compared to million at december  and million at december  allowance for loan losses of million of total loans at december  compared to million at december  and million at december  reduction in borrowed funds and subordinated debt to million at december  from million at december  and million at december  stockholders equity of million of total assets at december  compared to million at december  and million at december  
table of contents total assets grew million in  million of which resulted from growth in the loan portfolio excluding deferred loan origination costs 
of the loan growth  million occurred in the fourth quarter  an annualized rate of growth of 
total assets grew million in the growth was modest because loan growth of million  which included reductions in the auto loan portfolio million and residential mortgage loan portfolio million  was mostly offset by a million reduction in short term investments 
the balance of short term investments was reduced because the average yield earned on such investments became unattractive  declining from in to in the decline in auto loans outstanding was attributable to the lower volume of sales experienced by auto manufacturers which led to lower loan origination opportunities 
due to more aggressive competitor pricing  we decided to reduce our origination of residential mortgage loans 
commercial real estate loans grew million in and million in due in part to changes in the competitive landscape 
some of the market participants who previously were lenient in their underwriting reduced their origination activity as they began to experience higher levels of non performing loans and loan losses 
this development resulted in more rational market conditions and enabled us to compete more effectively for quality commercial real estate loans 
commercial loans grew million in and million in the increases resulted from the hiring of experienced commercial lenders and growth of the eastern funding loan portfolio

we believe the growth in deposits was due in part to expansion of our cash management capabilities  more effort in seeking deposits from existing customer relationships and the desire of certain depositors to place their funds in financial institutions with strong capital 
a significant decline in rates offered on deposits was a contributing reason for the shift in the mix of deposits as depositors chose to place funds in more liquid accounts 
much of the influx of deposits in and was used to pay off borrowings from the fhlb and million of brokered deposits which existed at december  operating results highlights from the results of operations for the years ended december   december  and december  were as follows an increase in net interest income of million in compared to and million in compared to excluding  of interest income in from the payoff of a loan on which there was unaccreted discount  the rates of increase in net interest income would have been and  respectively

interest rate spread represents the difference between the yield on interest earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin represents net interest income tax equivalent basis divided by average interest earning assets 
highlights from the preceding table follow 
the rise in net interest income and net interest margin in and was due primarily to loan and deposit growth  a higher portion of interest earning assets being funded by lower cost deposits and a more rapid decline in the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities than in the yield on interest earning assets 
the average balance of interest earning assets grew million in compared to and million in compared to all of the asset growth resulted from loan growth of million in compared to and million in compared to growth in compared to in the average balance of commercial real estate loans of million and commercial loans of million was partly offset by a reduction in the average balance of auto loans of million and consumer loans primarily residential mortgage loans of million 
in compared to  the average balance of commercial real estate loans increased million  commercial loans increased million and consumer loans primarily residential mortgage loans increased million  while the average balance of auto loans decreased million 
the average balance of short term investments was reduced from million in to million in and million in because of the significantly lower rates offered on such investments 
the decline in yield on equity securities in and compared to resulted from the elimination of dividend income on fhlb stock owned by the company

the average balance of loans to the average balance of deposits excluding brokered deposits declined from in to in and in the ratio was at december  continued improvement in net interest margin and interest rate spread  if any  is expected to be modest 
it has become more difficult to offset declining asset yields due to more competitive loan pricing and the currently low interest rate environment by reduction in rates paid on deposits and borrowed funds

table of contents the increase in net interest income in compared to resulted from growth in mortgage loans and commercial loans  reductions in brokered deposits and borrowed funds from the fhlb and lower rates paid on deposits and borrowed funds  offset in part by a reduction in auto loans and asset yields and an increase in deposits  excluding brokered deposits 
provision for credit losses the provision for credit losses results from the changes in the allowance for loan losses and the liability for unfunded credit commitments 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein for a description of how management determines the balance of the allowance for loan losses for each segment and class of loans 
the provision for credit losses was  in   in and  in while net loan charge offs in those years were  a charge off rate of based on average loans outstanding   and   respectively 
the provisions for credit losses in and were higher than net loan charge offs because of growth in loans outstanding and increases in problem loans and net charge offs  especially in the auto and eastern funding loan portfolios 
the provision for credit losses in was lower than net charge offs due primarily to a a significantly lower rate of auto loan net charge offs than contemplated which resulted in a lowering of the level of allowance for loan losses considered adequate for that segment of the loan portfolio and b charge offs of certain loans for which reserves had been established in the prior year 
the provision for loan losses in for the commercial real estate loan segment was  and net charge offs in that year were  this segment included commercial real estate mortgage  multi family mortgage and construction loans 
net charge offs included  related to the commercial real estate portfolio and  related to the construction loan portfolio 
part of the amounts charged off in were reserved for in the prior year 
there were no other charge offs of loans in this segment in and the provision for loan losses in for the commercial loan segment of  was higher than the net charge offs in that year of  due primarily to growth in loans outstanding 
this segment includes commercial  condominium association and eastern funding loans 
no commercial or condominium association loans were charged off in and  commercial loan charge offs were  in net charge offs of eastern funding loans in  and were   and  respectively 
additionally  write downs of assets acquired were   and  in those respective years 
the annualized rate of net charge offs  combined with write downs of assets acquired  equaled  and in those respective years 
eastern funding loans delinquent over days were million at the end of compared to million at the end of and million at the end of the provisions for auto loan losses in  and were   and  respectively  while net charge offs in those years were  of the average balance of loans outstanding excluding deferred loan origination costs   and   respectively 
the decline in charge offs is attributable primarily to more conservative underwriting criteria put in place in and  including curtailment of higher risk dealer accommodation loans  and a reduction in loan originations to borrowers with credit scores below from of total loans originated in to in  in and in loans delinquent over days were million of loans outstanding at the end of  million at the end of and million at the end of the allowance for loan losses related to auto loans excluding deferred loan origination costs at those dates was    and   respectively 

table of contents the provision for loan losses in for the consumer loan segment was  less than the net charge offs of  in that year  because of a million decline in loans outstanding and the charge off of loans reserved for in the prior year 
this segment includes residential mortgage  home equity and other consumer loans 
the unallocated portion of the allowance was reduced by  in through a credit to the provision for loan losses because of overall improvement in the level of charge offs  particularly in auto loans and eastern funding loans  as well stabilization in non performing loans 
the liability for unfunded credit commitments was maintained at  throughout and was reduced by  in and  in through credits to the provision for credit losses 
these movements in the balance of the liability account were made to reflect changes in the estimate of loss exposure associated with credit commitments 
no credit commitments were charged off against the liability account in  and prepayment penalties and sales of securities in and  million and million  respectively  of borrowings from the fhlb were prepaid resulting in penalties charged to income of  and  respectively 
those borrowed funds had high interest rates and were mostly replaced by new borrowings from the fhlb at lower interest rates and for extended periods of time 
investment securities primarily equity securities were sold in the second quarter of at a gain of  in the second quarter of  million of mortgage backed securities were sold at a gain of  and million of the proceeds was reinvested in corporate debt securities 
in the third and fourth quarters of  million and million  respectively  of mortgage backed securities were sold at gains of  and  respectively  and the proceeds were used to prepay borrowings from the fhlb 
sales of other securities resulted in a gain of  in and a loss of  in the transactions described above were made to improve net interest margin and to reduce a the company investment concentration in mortgage backed securities  b its exposure to the risk of extension of the estimated life of its mortgage backed securities in a rising interest rate environment and c its one year cumulative negative gap position 
impairment losses on securities impairment losses on securities net of non credit losses were  in   in and  in see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein for information regarding the securities on which impairment losses were recognized 
other operating highlights fees  charges and other income income from these sources was  in   in and  in overdraft fees declined from  in to  in and  in much of the decline in resulted from recent overdraft legislation 
a further decline in overdraft fees is expected as a result of the new overdraft legislation 
the increase in income in compared to resulted primarily from gains on the sale of residential mortgage loans 
generally  fixed rate loan originations with maturities in excess of years are sold to avoid long term interest rate exposure 

table of contents non interest expense amortization of identified intangible assets amounted to  in   in and  in the reductions were attributable to the amortization of a core deposit intangible resulting from the acquisition of mystic over nine years on an accelerated basis using the sum of the digits method 
excluding these charges  non interest expenses rose from million in to million in a increase and to million in a increase 
the higher expenses in compared to were due primarily to a   on an after tax basis of professional fees incurred in the fourth quarter related to the pending acquisition of first ipswich and other professional fees incurred throughout related to corporate issues and initiatives  b higher compensation and employee benefits due in part to added personnel in business banking and investment advisory services and higher bonus accruals  c the opening of two new branches in june  d added space and e higher marketing expenses due in part to product promotion  partially offset by lower fdic insurance expense and a reduction of loan collection related expenses 
the higher expenses in compared to were due primarily to a  increase in fdic insurance   of which was a special assessment in the second quarter of higher expenses for personnel  data processing services and professional fees were partially offset by reductions in expense for restricted stock awards and supplemental retirement benefits 
provision for income taxes the effective rate of income taxes was in  in and in the higher rates were due primarily to a lower portion of taxable income being earned by the company investment securities subsidiaries  lesser amounts of tax exempt income from municipal debt securities and  in  the non deductibility of a substantial portion of the professional fees incurred related to the pending first ipswich acquisition 
income on investment securities is subject to a lower rate of state taxation than the rate on income earned by the company and its other subsidiaries

the investment policy of the company  which is reviewed and approved by the board of directors on an annual basis  specifies the types of investments that are acceptable  required investment ratings by at least one nationally recognized rating agency  concentration limits and duration guidelines 
compliance with the investment policy is monitored on a regular basis 

table of contents us government sponsored enterprises debt securities of us government sponsored enterprises include obligations issued by the federal national mortgage association fnma  the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac  the federal home loan banks and the federal farm credit bank 
none of those obligations is backed by the full faith and credit of the us government 
in  most of the company investment purchases were debt securities issued by us government sponsored enterprises with maturities primarily in the eighteen month to thirty month range 
the company concentrated on acquiring debt securities with short maturities to reduce interest rate risk during a period of uncertainty as to the direction of interest rates 
as us government sponsored enterprises experienced rising losses and capital erosion in  especially fnma and freddie mac  we decided to stop purchasing debt securities issued by them 
in  we recommenced the purchase of debt securities issued by us government sponsored enterprises 
at december   issuers of debt securities with an estimated fair value of approximately million had the right to call or prepay the obligations 
municipal obligations and auction rate municipal obligations the company owned only one remaining municipal obligation at december   it was rated aa by a rating firm at that date and matures on august  auction rate municipal obligations are debt securities issued by municipal  county and state entities that are generally repaid from revenue sources such as hospitals  transportation systems  student education loans and property taxes 
the securities are not obligations of the issuing government entity 
the obligations are variable rate securities with long term maturities whose interest rates are set periodically through an auction process 
the auction period typically ranges from days to days 
the reduction in the amount invested in such obligations during the last three years resulted from redemptions at par by issuers 
the auction rate obligations owned by the company were rated aaa at the time of acquisition due  in part  to the guarantee of third party insurers who would have to pay the obligations if the issuers failed to pay the obligations when they become due 
in the first quarter  public disclosures indicated that certain third party insurers were experiencing financial difficulties and  therefore  might not be able to meet their contractual obligations 
as a result  auctions failed to attract a sufficient number of investors and created a liquidity problem for those investors who were relying on the obligations to be redeemed at auction 
since then  there has not been an active market for auction rate municipal obligations 
based on an evaluation of market factors  the estimated fair value of the auction rate municipal obligations owned by the company at december  was  or  less than their face value 
full collection of the obligations is expected because the financial condition of the issuers is sound  none of the issuers has defaulted on scheduled payments  the obligations are rated investment grade and we have the ability and intent to hold the obligations for a period of time to recover the unrealized losses 
corporate obligations in  the company increased its investment in corporate obligations in order to diversify its investment portfolio and improve the overall yield on investments 
the corporate debt securities owned at december  will mature primarily within three years 
included in corporate obligations are investments in preferred trust securities pretsls that were acquired several years ago 
pretsls represent investment instruments comprised of a pool of trust preferred securities that are debt obligations issued by a number of financial institutions and insurance 
table of contents companies 
the investment instruments can be segregated into tranches segments that establish priority rights to cash flows from the underlying trust preferred securities 
at december   the company owned two pools of trust preferred securities  pretsl vi and pretsl xxviii 
the book value of pretsl vi was  at december  three of the issuers  representing of the pool were in default and have deferred regularly scheduled interest payments 
due to the lack of an orderly market for this security  based on an analysis of projected cash flows   was charged to earnings in and an additional  was charged to earnings in as of december   the fair value of this security was estimated to be  based on analytical modeling taking into consideration a range of factors normally found in an orderly market 
the unrealized loss of  on this security was not considered to be an other than temporary impairment loss because projected cash flows exceeded the book value of the security 
the book value of pretsl xxviii was  at december  and the estimated fair value based on factors similar to those used to value the security mentioned in the preceding paragraph was  at that date 
the unrealized loss of  was not considered to be an other than temporary impairment loss because the security is rated investment grade  we have first priority to future cash redemptions and over of the issuers in the pool would have to default before recovery of our investment could be in doubt 
none of the issuers comprising the pool represent more than of the entire pool 
fifteen issuers representing approximately of the remaining aggregate investment pool at december  were in default and have deferred regularly scheduled interest payments at that date 
at december   the aggregate book value of other trust preferred securities owned by the company was  and the aggregate market value was  the aggregate unrealized loss on these securities of  was not considered to be an other than temporary impairment loss because of the financial soundness and prospects of the issuers and our ability and intent to hold the securities for a period of time to recover the unrealized losses 
mortgage securities the company also invests in mortgage related securities  including collateralized mortgage obligations cmos 
these securities are considered attractive investments because they a generate positive yields with minimal administrative expense  b impose minimal credit risk as a result of the guarantees usually provided  c can be utilized as collateral for borrowings  d generate cash flows useful for liquidity management and e are qualified thrift investments for purposes of the thrift lender test that the company is obliged to meet for regulatory purposes 
mortgage related securities are created by the pooling of mortgages and the issuance of a security with an interest rate that is less than the average interest rate on the underlying mortgages 
mortgage related securities purchased by the company generally are comprised of a pool of single family mortgages 
the issuers of such securities are generally us government sponsored enterprises such as fnma  freddie mac and gnma who pool and resell participation interests in the form of securities to investors and guarantee the payment of principal and interest to the investors 
investments in mortgage related securities issued and guaranteed by us government sponsored enterprises generally do not entail significant credit risk 
such investments  however  are susceptible to significant interest rate and cash flow risks when actual cash flows from the investments differ from cash flows estimated at the time of purchase 
additionally  the market value of such securities can be affected adversely by market changes in interest rates 
prepayments that are faster than anticipated may shorten the life of a security and result in the accelerated expensing of any premiums paid  thereby reducing the net yield earned on the security 
although prepayments of underlying mortgages depend on many factors  the difference between the interest rates on the underlying mortgages and prevailing mortgage interest rates generally is the most significant determinant of the rate of prepayments 
during 
table of contents periods of declining interest rates  refinancing generally increases and accelerates the prepayment of underlying mortgages and the related security 
such an occurrence can also create reinvestment risk because of the unavailability of other investments with a comparable rate of return in relation to the nature and maturity of the alternative investment 
conversely  in a rising interest rate environment  prepayments may decline  thereby extending the estimated life of the security and depriving the company of the ability to reinvest cash flows at the higher market rates of interest 
cmos are a type of debt security issued by a special purpose entity that aggregates pools of mortgages and mortgage related securities and creates different classes of cmo securities with varying maturities and amortization schedules as well as residual interest with each class possessing different risk characteristics 
the cash flows from the underlying collateral are generally divided into tranches  or classes  whereby tranches have descending priorities with respect to the distribution of principal and interest repayment of the underlying mortgages and mortgage related securities  as opposed to pass through mortgage backed securities where cash flows are distributed pro rata to all security holders 
in contrast to mortgage backed securities from which cash flow is received pro rata by all security holders and hence  prepayment risk is shared  the cash flow from the mortgages or mortgage related securities underlying cmos is paid in accordance with predetermined priority to investors holding various tranches of such securities 
a particular tranche of a cmo may therefore carry prepayment risk that differs from that of both the underlying collateral and other tranches 
generally  the company has invested in the first tranche of cmos 
mortgage securities acquired in and were purchased mostly because of their higher yield in relation to other investment possibilities and their guarantee by the issuing us government sponsored enterprises 
in  million of mortgage backed securities were sold to reduce the company investment concentration in mortgage backed securities and to use the proceeds to prepay high rate funds borrowed from the fhlb 
marketable equity securities at december   the company owned marketable equity securities with a fair value of  including net unrealized gains of  restricted equity securities at december   the company owned stock in the fhlb with a carrying value of million 
at december   the fhlb had total assets of billion and total capital of billion  of which million was retained earnings 
the fhlb stated that it remained in compliance with all regulatory capital ratios as of december  and  based on the most recent information available  was classified as adequately capitalized by its regulator 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein for further information about the fhlb

the company also provides financing for construction and development projects  home equity and other consumer loans 
the company relies on community and business contacts as well as referrals from customers  attorneys and other professionals to generate loans 
in addition  existing borrowers are an important source of business since many of them have more than one loan outstanding with the company 
the company ability to originate loans depends on the strength of the economy  trends in interest rates  customer demands and competition 
it is the company current policy that the aggregate amount of loans outstanding to any one borrower or related entities may not exceed million unless approved by the executive committee of the board of directors 
at december   one borrower had aggregate loans outstanding of million that were approved by the executive committee of the board of directors 
including that borrower  there were borrowers each with aggregate loans outstanding of million or greater at december  the cumulative total of those loans was million  or of loans outstanding in the commercial real estate and commercial loan segments excluding eastern funding loans 

table of contents the company has written underwriting policies to control the inherent risks in loan origination 
the policies address approval limits  loan to value ratios  appraisal requirements  debt service coverage ratios  loan concentration limits and other matters relevant to loan underwriting 
commercial real estate loans this segment  which is comprised of commercial real estate  multi family mortgage and construction loans  is the largest segment in the company loan portfolio and represented of total loans outstanding at december  typically  commercial real estate loans are larger in size and involve a greater degree of risk than owner occupied residential mortgage loans 
loan repayment is usually dependent on the successful operation and management of the properties and the value of the properties securing the loans 
economic conditions can greatly affect cash flows and property values 
a number of factors are considered in originating commercial real estate and multi family mortgage loans 
the qualifications and financial condition of the borrower including credit history  as well as the potential income generation and the value and condition of the underlying property  are evaluated 
when evaluating the qualifications of the borrower  the company considers the financial resources of the borrower  the borrower experience in owning or managing similar property and the borrower payment history with the company and other financial institutions 
factors considered in evaluating the underlying property include the net operating income of the mortgaged premises before debt service and depreciation  the debt service coverage ratio the ratio of cash flow before debt service to debt service and the ratio of the loan amount to the appraised value 
generally  personal guarantees are obtained from commercial real estate loan borrowers 
frequently  commercial real estate and multi family mortgage loans are originated for terms of five to ten years with an amortization period of twenty to twenty five years 
many of the loans are priced at inception on a fixed rate basis generally for periods ranging from two to seven years 
to reduce interest rate risk  occasionally the company partially funds such loans by borrowings from the fhlb on a fixed rate basis for periods that approximate the fixed rate terms of the loans 
generally  a yield maintenance fee is collected when a fixed rate loan is paid off prior to its maturity 
over of the commercial real estate loans outstanding at december  were secured by properties located in massachusetts 
the commercial real estate portfolio at that date was comprised primarily of loans secured by apartment buildings million  retail stores million  office buildings million  mixed use properties million and industrial properties million 
construction and development financing is generally considered to involve a higher degree of risk than long term financing on improved  occupied real estate 
risk of loss on a construction loan is largely dependent upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of construction costs  the estimated time to sell or rent the completed property at an adequate price or rate of occupancy  and market conditions 
if the estimates and projections prove to be inaccurate  the company may be confronted with a project which  upon completion  has a value that is insufficient to assure full loan repayment 
criteria applied in underwriting construction loans for which the primary source of repayment is the sale of the property are different from the criteria applied in underwriting construction loans for which the primary source of repayment is the stabilized cash flow from the completed project 
for those loans where the primary source of repayment is from resale of the property  in addition to the normal credit analysis performed for other loans  the company also analyzes project costs  the attractiveness of the property in relation to the market in which it is located and demand within the market area 
for those construction loans where the source of repayment is the stabilized cash flow from the completed project  the company analyzes not only project costs but also how long it might take to achieve satisfactory occupancy and the reasonableness of projected rental rates in relation to market rental rates 

table of contents historically  construction and development lending has been a modest part of the company loan originations 
at december   construction loans equaled million  or of total loans outstanding at that date 
commercial loans this segment is comprised of commercial loans  eastern funding loans and condominium association loans and represented of total loans outstanding at december  growth in commercial loans over the past few years has resulted from the hiring of officers with extensive experience in commercial lending 
the company provides commercial banking services to companies in its market area 
product offerings include lines of credit  term loans  letters of credit  deposit services and cash management 
these types of credit facilities have as their primary source of repayment cash flows from the operations of a business 
interest rates offered are available on a floating basis tied to the prime rate or a similar index or on a fixed rate basis referenced on the fhlb index 
credit extensions are made to established businesses on the basis of an analysis of their financial statements  the nature of collateral to secure the credit extension and  in most instances  the personal guarantee of the owner of the business 
we also participate in us government programs such as the small business administration in both the a program and as a sba preferred lender 
the eastern funding portfolio is comprised primarily of loans to finance coin operated laundry  dry cleaning and convenience store equipment and businesses 
the borrowers are located primarily in the greater new york new jersey metropolitan area  although the customer base extends to locations throughout the united states of america 
typically  the loans are priced at a fixed rate of interest and require monthly payments over their three to seven year life 
in some instances  the life of a loan can extend to ten years 
eastern funding focuses on making loans to customers with business experience 
an important part of eastern funding loan originations comes from existing customers as they expand their operations and acquire additional stores 
the size of loan that eastern funding is willing to make is determined by an analysis of cash flow and other characteristics pertaining to the store and equipment to be financed 
eastern funding has developed a base of data of the revenue and profitability of stores it has financed 
it has also accumulated data on the prices at which stores have sold 
eastern funding loan policy contains limits on the multiples of revenues and earnings that can be applied to derive an estimate of the value of a store to be financed 
the yields earned on eastern funding loans are higher than those earned on commercial loans made by brookline because they involve a higher degree of credit risk 
its customers are typically small business owners who operate with limited financial resources and who are more at risk when the economy weakens or unforeseen adverse events arise 
because of these characteristics  personal guarantees of borrowers are usually obtained along with liens on available assets 
loans to condominium associations are for the purpose of funding capital improvements  are made for five to ten year terms and are secured by a general assignment of condominium association revenues 
among the factors considered in the underwriting of such loans are the level of owner occupancy  the financial condition and history of the condominium association  the attractiveness of the property in relation to the market in which it is located and the reasonableness of estimates of the cost of capital improvements to be made 
depending on loan size  funds are advanced as capital improvements are made and  in more complex situations  after completion of engineering inspections 

table of contents auto loans this loan segment represented of total loans outstanding at december  the reduction in auto loans in resulted from lower loan originations as the auto industry experienced lower sales and lenders affiliated with auto manufacturers offered loan terms at low rates which we chose not to match 
the loans are for the purchase of automobiles both new and used and light duty trucks primarily to individuals  but also to corporations and other organizations 
the loans are originated through dealerships and assigned to the company 
the vice president responsible for auto lending must approve the application of any dealer with whom the company does business 
the company does business with over dealerships located primarily in massachusetts  but also in connecticut  rhode island and new hampshire 
dealer relationships are reviewed periodically for application quality  the ratio of loans approved to applications submitted and loan performance 
loan applications are generated by approved dealers and data are entered into an application processing system 
a credit bureau scorecard model is used in the underwriting process 
the model is based on data accumulated by nationally recognized credit bureaus and is a risk assessment tool that analyzes an individual credit history and assigns a numeric credit score 
the model meets the requirements of the equal credit opportunity act 
the application processing system statistically grades each application according to score ranges 
depending on the data received  an application is either approved or denied automatically or submitted to a credit underwriter for review 
credit underwriters may override system designated approvals 
loans approved by the underwriters must meet criteria guidelines established in the company loan policy 
credit profile measurements such as debt to income ratios  payment to income ratios and loan to value ratios are utilized in the underwriting process and to monitor the performance of loans falling within specified ratio ranges 
regarding loan to value ratios  the company considers auto loans to be essentially credits that are less than fully collateralized 
when borrowers cease to make required payments  repossession and sale of the vehicle financed usually results in insufficient funds to fully pay the remaining loan balance 
while the company auto loan policy permits the aggregate amount of loans with credit scores of less than to comprise as much as of loans outstanding  at december   loans with credit scores below were in fact of loans outstanding 
the average dollar original weighted credit score of loans in the portfolio at that date was see the subsection provision for credit losses appearing elsewhere herein for further information regarding loan underwriting and the average credit scores of the borrowers to whom auto loans were made 
all loans require the purchase of single interest insurance by the borrower 
the insurance is designed to protect the company from loss when a loan is in default and the collateral value is impaired due to vehicle damage or the company is unable to take possession of the vehicle 
auto loans are assigned a particular tier based on the credit score determined by the credit bureau 
the tier is used for pricing purposes only so as to assure consistency in loan pricing 
tier rates can be modified if certain conditions exist as outlined in the company loan policy 
the rate paid by a borrower usually differs with the buy rate earned by the company 
a significant part of the difference between the two rates is retained by the dealer in accordance with terms agreed to between the dealer and the company 
the difference is commonly referred to as the spread 
most of the spread is paid after the end of the month in which the loan is made and is comprised of the agreed upon rate differential multiplied by the expected average balance of the loan over its scheduled maturity 
if a loan is repaid in entirety within days of the loan origination date  the dealer must pay the remainder of unamortized spread to the company 
if a loan is repaid after days  the dealer is not obliged to repay any part of the spread amount previously received 
spread payments to dealers are 
table of contents amortized as a reduction of interest received from borrowers over the life of the related loans 
when loans are prepaid  any remaining unamortized balance is charged to expense at that time 
in certain instances  a fixed fee is paid to the dealer for each loan originated 
depending on the terms of the dealer enrollment agreement with the company  the dealer earns a fee in its entirety days after the loan is originated or upon the borrower making at least three payments on the loan 
various reports are generated to monitor receipt of required loan documents  adherence to loan policy parameters  dealer performance  loan delinquencies and loan charge offs 
summary reports are submitted to the chief credit officer  the chief financial officer and the board of directors on a monthly basis 
consumer loans this segment is comprised of residential mortgage loans  home equity loans and other consumer loans and represented of total loans outstanding at december  residential mortgage loans equaled of total loans outstanding at that date 
due to aggressive competitor pricing  we decided to reduce our origination of residential mortgage loans over the past two years 
we offer both fixed rate and adjustable rate mortgage loans secured by one to four family residences 
generally  fixed rate residential mortgage loans with maturities beyond ten years are not maintained in the company loan portfolio 
each residential mortgage loan granted is subject to a satisfactorily completed application  employment verification  credit history and a demonstrated ability to repay the debt 
appraisals are performed by outside independent fee appraisers 
in general  we follow guidelines established by the federal home loan mortgage corporation and the federal national mortgage corporation 
underwriting guidelines for home equity loans and lines of credit are similar to those for residential mortgage loans 
home equity loans and lines of credit are limited to no more than of the appraised value of the property securing the loan less the amount of any existing first mortgage liens 
other consumer loans at december  equaled of all loans outstanding at that date 
equity and debt securities were pledged as collateral for a substantial part of the total of those loans

the manner in which the allowance is established is based on judgments  assumptions and estimates that are difficult  complex and subjective 
use of different judgments  
table of contents assumptions and estimates could result in material differences in our operating results or financial condition 
accordingly  the policies that govern our assessment of the allowance for loan losses are considered critical accounting policies and are discussed under that heading appearing elsewhere herein

prior to december   the allowance for loan losses included amounts for unfunded credit commitments 
such amounts were determined by multiplying the reserve factors assigned to each loan segment times the balance of unfunded commitments by loan segment 
effective december   the allowance related to unfunded credit commitments of  was transferred from the allowance for loan losses to a separate liability account 
this change  which was made to comply with the requirements of generally accepted accounting principles  had no effect on the consolidated earnings of the company 
this accounting treatment was not followed prior to that date due to immateriality

restructured loans represent performing loans for which concessions such as reductions of interest rates to below market terms and or extension of repayment terms were granted due to a borrower financial condition 
at december  and  loans past due days or more and still on accrual amounted to  and  respectively 
the loans were comprised of commercial real estate loans  multi family mortgage loans and commercial loans that matured and the borrowers continued to make their regular principal and interest payments as if their loans had been renewed when  if fact  the renewals had not yet taken place 
it is expected that the loans will be renewed or paid in full without any loss 
non performing assets include other real estate owned resulting from foreclosures of properties securing mortgage loans or acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure  repossessed vehicles resulting from non payment of amounts due under auto loans and repossessed equipment resulting from non payment of amounts due under eastern funding loans 
other real estate owned and repossessed vehicles and equipment are recorded at estimated fair value less costs to sell 
non accrual loans at december  included six residential mortgage loans  one construction loan  one multi family mortgage loan and one home equity loan 
loss exposure related to the loans on non accrual is not considered to be significant and has been recognized through the establishment of reserves included in the allowance for loan losses 
however  if the local and regional real estate market does not improve  additions to the allowance for loan losses could become necessary 

table of contents eastern funding and auto loans on non accrual are comprised of several loans 
see the subsections provision for credit losses appearing elsewhere herein for information about delinquencies and net charge offs in the eastern funding and auto loan portfolios 
the decline in repossessed vehicles over the past three years was due primarily to improvements in the quality of the auto loan portfolio resulting from application of stricter underwriting criteria commencing in the second half of the increase in repossessed vehicles in was attributable to an increase in borrowers who were unable to make required loan payments and weaker demand for repossessed vehicles at dealer auctions 
the increases in repossessed equipment in and were attributable to a rise in the number of eastern funding borrowers who were unable to make required loan payments 
the decline in repossessed equipment in and resulted from more aggressive collection efforts 
at december   restructured loans included  of eastern funding loans and  of residential mortgage loans  at december   restructured loans included  of eastern funding loans and  of residential mortgage loans  at december  and  restructured loans were comprised entirely of eastern funding loans 
restructured loans are loans where the maturity date was extended and or interest rates were reduced to drop required monthly payments to more manageable amounts for the borrowers 
the other receivable amounting to  at december  was collected in full subsequent to that date 
deposits historically  deposits have been the company primary source of funds 
the company offers a variety of deposit accounts with a range of interest rates and terms 
the company deposit accounts consist of non interest bearing checking accounts and interest bearing now accounts  savings accounts and money market savings accounts referred to in the aggregate as transaction deposit accounts and certificate of deposit accounts 
the company offers individual retirement accounts iras and other qualified plan accounts 
the flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions  changes in money market rates  prevailing interest rates and the relative attractiveness of competing deposit and investment alternatives 
deposits are obtained predominantly from customers in the communities in which our banking offices are located 
deposits are also gathered via the internet 
the company relies primarily on competitive pricing of its deposit products  customer service and long standing relationships with customers to attract and retain deposits 
market interest rates and rates offered by competing financial institutions significantly affect the company ability to attract and retain deposits 
the following table presents the deposit activity excluding brokered deposits of the company for the years indicated 
year ended december  dollars in thousands net deposits interest credited on deposit accounts total increase in deposit accounts in  transaction deposit accounts increased million  or  and certificates of deposit excluding brokered deposits decreased million  or 
in  transaction deposit accounts increased million  or  and certificates of deposit excluding brokered deposits increased 
table of contents million  or 
in  transaction deposit accounts increased million  or  and certificates of deposit decreased million  or 
we believe the growth in deposits and the shift in the mix of deposits in and were due in part to expansion of our cash management capabilities  more effort in seeking deposits from existing customer relationships and the desire of certain depositors to place their funds in a stronger capitalized financial institution and in more liquid accounts 
a rise in interest rates could cause a shift from transaction deposit accounts to certificates of deposit accounts with longer maturities 
generally  the rates paid on certificates of deposit are higher than those paid on transaction deposit accounts 
the company obtained million of brokered certificates of deposit in and used the funds primarily to pay off some of the higher rate borrowed funds of eastern funding that were outstanding at the time of our acquisition of a controlling interest in eastern funding 
brokered deposits were used as a source of funds because the interest rates payable on those deposits were lower than the interest rates we would have had to pay if we had obtained funds from other borrowing sources

the advances are secured by a blanket security agreement which requires the bank to maintain as collateral certain qualifying assets  principally mortgage loans and securities in an aggregate amount at least equal to outstanding advances 
the maximum amount that the fhlb will advance to member institutions  including the company  fluctuates from time to time in accordance with the policies of the fhlb 
at december   the company had million in outstanding advances from the fhlb and had the capacity to borrow an additional million from the fhlb 
occasionally  commencing in  the company purchased federal funds on an overnight basis 
at december   it had million of such borrowings

table of contents contractual obligations a summary of contractual obligations at december  by the expected payment period follows 
payment due by period less than one year one to three years three to five years over five years total in thousands borrowed funds from the fhlb loan commitments occupancy lease commitments service provider contracts retirement benefit obligations these amounts represent commitments made by the company to extend credit to borrowers as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses 
since some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
the leases contain escalation clauses for real estate taxes and other expenditures 
payments to service providers under most of the existing contracts are based on the volume of accounts served or transactions processed 
some contracts also call for higher required payments when there are increases in the consumer price index 
the expected payments shown in this table are based on an estimate of the number of accounts to be served or transactions to be processed  but do not include any projection of the effect of changes in the consumer price index 
liquidity and capital resources the company primary sources of funds are deposits  principal and interest payments on loans and debt securities and borrowings from the fhlb 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and investments are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and mortgage loan prepayments are greatly influenced by interest rate trends  economic conditions and competition 
based on its monitoring of historic deposit trends and its current pricing strategy for deposits  management believes the company will retain a large portion of its existing deposit base 
while deposits grew significantly in and  growth in will depend on several factors  including the strength of the economy  the interest rate environment and competitor pricing 
the company utilizes advances from the fhlb to fund growth and to manage part of the interest rate sensitivity of its assets and liabilities 
generally  borrowings from the fhlb result in more interest expense than would be incurred if growth was funded solely by deposits 
advances outstanding from the fhlb decreased from million at the end of to million at the end of and million at the end of as the company used part of its deposit growth and proceeds from the sale of mortgage backed securities to pay off borrowings 
at december   the company had the capacity to borrow an additional million from the fhlb 
the company most liquid assets are cash and due from banks  short term investments and debt securities that generally mature within days 
at december   such assets amounted to million  or of total assets 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and or interest rates 
since net interest income is the company primary source of revenue  interest rate risk is the most significant non credit related market risk to which the company is exposed 
the company asset liability committee  comprised of several members of senior management  is responsible for managing interest rate risk in accordance with policies approved by the board of directors regarding acceptable levels of interest rate risk  liquidity and capital 
the committee reviews with the board of directors on a quarterly basis its activities and strategies  the effect of those strategies on the company operating results  the company interest rate risk position and the effect subsequent changes in interest rates could have on the company future net interest income 
the committee is involved in the planning process as well as in the monitoring of pricing for the company loan and deposit products 
the committee manages interest rate risk through use of both earnings simulation and gap analysis 
earnings simulation is based on actual cash flows and assumptions of management about future changes in interest rates and levels of activity loan originations  loan prepayments and deposit flows 
the assumptions are inherently uncertain and  therefore  actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and strategies 
the net interest income projection resulting from use of actual cash flows and management assumptions base case is compared to net interest income projections based on an immediate shift of basis points upward or downward in the first year of the model interest rate shock 
the following table indicates the estimated impact on net interest income over a one year period under scenarios of a basis points change upward or downward as a percentage of base case earnings projections 
changes in interest rates basis points estimated percentage change in future net interest income over one year base case over one year the company interest rate risk policy states that an immediate basis points change upward or downward should not negatively impact estimated net interest income over a one year period by more than 
the results shown above are based on the assumption that there are no significant changes in the company operating environment and that short term interest rates will remain at current levels for all of further  in the case of the basis points downward adjustment  it was assumed that it would not be possible to reduce the rates paid on certain deposit accounts by basis points 
instead  it was assumed that now accounts would be reduced by basis points and savings accounts by basis points 
there can be no assurance that the assumptions used will be validated in gap analysis measures the difference between the assets and liabilities repricing or maturing within specific time periods 
an asset sensitive position indicates that there are more rate sensitive assets than rate sensitive liabilities repricing or maturing within specific time horizons  which would generally imply a favorable impact on net interest income in periods of rising interest rates and a negative impact in periods of falling rates 
a liability sensitive position would generally imply a negative impact on net interest income in periods of rising rates and a positive impact in periods of falling rates 
gap analysis has limitations because it cannot measure the effect of interest rate movements and competitive pressures on the repricing and maturity characteristics of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 

table of contents generally  it is the company policy to reasonably match the rate sensitivity of its assets and liabilities 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within the same time period 
the table below shows the company interest rate sensitivity gap position as of december  one year or less more than one year to two years more than two years to three years more than three years to four years more than four years to five years more than five years to ten years more than ten years total dollars in thousands interest earning assets short term investments weighted average rate debt securities weighted average rate commercial real estate loans weighted average rate commercial loans weighted average rate auto loans weighted average rate consumer loans weighted average rate total interest earning assets weighted average rate interest bearing liabilities now accounts weighted average rate savings accounts weighted average rate money market savings accounts weighted average rate certificates of deposit weighted average rate borrowed funds weighted average rate total interest bearing liabilities weighted average rate interest sensitivity gap cumulative interest sensitivity gap cumulative interest sensitivity gap as a percentage of total assets cumulative interest sensitivity gap as a percentage of total interest earning assets interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are included in the period in which the balances are expected to be redeployed and or repriced as a result of anticipated prepayments  scheduled rate adjustments and contractual maturities 
debt securities include all debt securities 
unrealized gains and losses on securities  all other marketable equity securities and restricted equity securities are excluded 
for purposes of the gap analysis  the allowance for loan losses  deferred loan origination costs and fair value adjustments are excluded 
interest sensitivity gap represents the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 

table of contents interest rates paid on now accounts  savings accounts and money market savings accounts are subject to change at any time and such deposits are immediately withdrawable 
a review of rates paid on these deposit categories over the last several years indicated that the amount and timing of rate changes did not coincide with the amount and timing of rate changes on other deposits when the federal reserve adjusted its benchmark federal funds rate 
because of this lack of correlation and the unlikelihood that such deposits would be withdrawn immediately  the company allocates money market savings accounts between the one year or less and the more than one year to two years columns and now accounts and savings accounts equally over those two columns and the more than two years to three years column in its gap position table 
at december   interest earning assets maturing or repricing within one year amounted to billion and interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within one year amounted to billion  resulting in a cumulative one year negative gap position of million  or of total assets 
at december   the company had a cumulative one year negative gap position of million  or of total assets 
the change in the cumulative one year gap position from the end of resulted primarily from the extension of maturities of borrowings from the fhlb 
the company cumulative positive interest sensitivity gap of assets and liabilities with expected maturities of more than three years changed from approximately million  or  of total assets at december  to million  or  of total assets at december  other market risks 
included in the company investment portfolio at december  were marketable equity securities with a market value of  that amount includes net unrealized gains of  movements in the market price of securities may affect the amount of gains or losses ultimately realized by the company from the sale of its equity securities
