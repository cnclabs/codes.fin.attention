the company business strategy is to operate as a well capitalized  profitable and independent community bank dedicated to providing value added products and services to our customers 
generally  the company has sought to implement this strategy by emphasizing retail deposits as its primary source of funds and maintaining a substantial part of its assets in locally originated residential first mortgage loans  loans to business enterprises operating in its markets  and in investment securities 
specifically  the company business strategy incorporates the following elements i operating as an independent community oriented financial institution  ii maintaining capital in excess of regulatory requirements  iii emphasizing investment in one to four family residential mortgage loans  loans to small businesses and investment securities  and iv maintaining a strong retail deposit base 
the company net income is primarily dependent on its net interest income  which is the difference between interest income earned on its investments in mortgage and other loans  investment securities and other assets  and its cost of funds consisting of interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
the company net income also is affected by its provision for loan losses  as well as by the amount of noninterest income  including income from fees  service charges and servicing rights  net gains and losses on sales and redemptions of securities  loans and foreclosed real estate  and noninterest expense such as employee compensation and benefits  occupancy and equipment costs  data processing costs and income taxes 
earnings of the company also are affected significantly by general economic and competitive conditions  particularly changes in market interest rates  government policies and actions of regulatory authorities  of which these events are beyond the control of the company 
in particular  the general level of market rates tends to be highly cyclical 
application of critical accounting policies the company consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and follow practices within the banking industry 
application of these principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions and judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materiall y different than originally reported 
estimates  assumptions and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based on quoted market prices or are provided by other third party sources  when available 
when third party information is not available  valuation adjustments are estimated in good faith by management 
the most significant accounting policies followed by the company are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this discussion  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the consolidated financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions and estimates underlying those amounts  management has identified the allowance for loan losses  deferred income taxes  pension obligations  the evaluation of goodwill for impairment  the evaluation of investment securities for other than temporary impairment and the estimation of fair values for accounti ng and disclosure purposes to be the accounting areas that require the most subjective and complex judgments  and as such  could be the most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
page 
table of contents the allowance for loan losses represents management estimate of probable loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the consolidated statements of condition 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the methodology used to determine the allowance for loan losses  and a discussion of the fact ors driving changes in the amount of the allowance for loan losses is included in this report 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined using the liability method 
under this method  the net deferred tax asset or liability is recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as net operating and capital loss carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates applied to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date 
to the extent that current available evidence about the future raises doubt about the likelihood of a deferred tax asset being realized  a valuation allowance is established 
the judgment about the level of future taxable income  including that which is considered capital  is inherently subjective and is reviewed on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change 
a valuation allowance of  was maintained at december   as management believes it may not generate sufficient capital gains to offset its capital loss carry forward 
the company s effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate due to non taxable income from investment securities and bank owned life insurance offset  in  by the valuation allowance established on a portion of the capital loss carry forwards 
pension and post retirement benefit plan liabilities and expenses are based upon actuarial assumptions of future events  including fair value of plan assets  interest rates  rate of future compensation increases and the length of time the company will have to provide those benefits 
the assumptions used by management are discussed in note to the consolidated annual financial statements 
management performs an annual valuation of the company s goodwill for possible impairment 
based on the results of this testing  management has determined that the carrying value of goodwill is not impaired as of december  the valuation approach is described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
the company carries all of its investments at fair value with any unrealized gains or losses reported net of tax as an adjustment to shareholders equity  except for the credit related portion of debt security impairment losses and other than temporary impairment of equity securities  which are charged to earnings 
the company ability to fully realize the value of its investments in various securities  including corporate debt securities  is dependent on the underlying creditworthiness of the issuing organization 
in evaluating the debt security portfolio for other than temporary impairment losses  management considers if we intend to sell the security  if it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis  or if the present v alue of expected cash flows is not sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis 
in determining whether otti has occurred for equity securities  the company considers the applicable factors described above and the length of time the equity security s fair value has been below the carrying amount 
management continually analyzes the portfolio to determine if further impairment has occurred that may be deemed as other than temporary 
further charges are possible depending on future economic conditions 
page 
table of contents the estimation of fair value is significant to several of our assets  including investment securities available for sale  the interest rate derivative  intangible assets and foreclosed real estate  as well as the value of loan collateral when valuing loans 
these are all recorded at either fair value or the lower of cost or fair value 
fair values are determined based on third party sources  when available 
furthermore  accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments as a part of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
fair values may be influenced by a number of factors  including market interest rates  prepayment speeds  discount rates and the shape of yield curves 
fair values for securities available for sale are obtained from an independent third party pricing service 
where available  fair values are based on quoted prices on a nationally recognized securities exchange 
if quoted prices are not available  fair values are measured using quoted market prices for similar benchmark securities 
management made no adjustments to the fair value quotes that were provided by the pricing source 
the fair values of foreclosed real estate and the underlying collateral value of impaired loans are typically determined based on appraisals by third parties  less estimated costs to sell 
if necessary  appraisals are updated to reflect changes in market conditions

these loans generally have higher inherent risk characteristics than a traditional residential real estate portfolio 
it has been the company s intention to continue to provide for future loan losses at a consistently higher level in light of the general weakening in economic conditions and overall asset quality

the co mpany ratio of allowance for loan losses to period end loans increased to at december  as compared to at december  non performing loans to period end loans increased to at december  from at december  the increase in non performing loans is primarily the result of an increase in delinquency of a small number of relatively large commercial real estate loan relationships

the increase in debit card interchange fees is due to increased customer activity  which is driv en by the debit card rewards program that was established late in the third quarter of as a result of the dodd frank act mandated limits on interchange fees of larger institutions  and market pressure on the company that may follow  debit card interchange fee income may decrease in the future 
the  increase in other charges  commissions and fees was attributable to an increase in investment services revenue and automated teller machine fees due to increased activity 
the increases were partially offset by a  decrease in service charges on deposit accounts associated with a decrease in customer use of the company s extended overdraft program

these large commercial relationships are monitored closely by management and met with on a regular basis to work out repayment plans and alternative strategies for collection 
it is management s intention to work closely and patiently with the small business owners as they adapt to the new market dynamics 
management continues to monitor and react to national and local economic trends as well as general portfolio conditions  which may impact the quality of the portfolio 
in response to recent trends and risk management the bank has increased the provision for loan losses  maintaining the company s strict loan underwriting standards and carefully monitoring the performance of the loan portfolio 
the current level of non performing assets would not have fallen outside of the bank historic level trends were it not for the inclusion of three large commercial relationships 
the increase in non performing loans since december  is comprised of primarily these three large relationships totaling million 
the largest of these relationships totals million in non performing loans at december  of the balance outstanding  approximately million is secured by commercial real estate and equipment 
a current evaluation of the commercial real estate and equipment was obtained from a third party in june management believes that the appraised fair value of the underlying collateral  discounted for selling costs  along with the associ ated guarantees of business principals and the existing allowance provided against these loans of  are adequate to cover the carrying amounts of the loans 
during the third quarter of  two other relatively large commercial relationships  with a combined loan balance of approximately million  became non performing 
both lending relationships are secured by commercial real estate and equipment  as well as personal and sba guarantees 
management believes that the collateral securing these loans  along with the guarantees of either business principals or government entities  and the existing allowance specifically allocated for the loans of  are adequate to cover the carrying amounts of the loans 
appraisals are obtained at the time a real estate secured loan is originated 
collateral is reevaluated should the loan become days delinquent to best determine the bank s level of exposure 
for commercial real estate held as collateral  the property is inspected every two years 
when evaluating our ability to collect from secondary sources  appraised values are adjusted to reflect the age of appraisal  the condition of the property  the current local real estate market  and cost to sell 
properties are re appraised when our evaluation of the current property condition and the local real estate market suggests values may not be accurate 
page 
table of contents the company generally places a loan on non accrual status and ceases accruing interest when loan payment performance is deemed unsatisfactory and the loan is past due days or more 
there are no loans that are past due or more and are still accruing interest 
the company considers a loan impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan 
the measurement of impaired loans is generally based upon the present value of future cash flows discounted at the historical effective interest rate  except that all collateral dependent loans are measured for impairment based on the fair value of the collateral 
the company used the fair value of collateral to measure impairment on commercial and commercial real estate loans 
at december  and  the company had million and million in loans  which were deemed to be impaired  having valuation allowances of million and  respectively 
management has identified additional potential problem loans totaling million as of december   compared to million in potential problem loans as of december  these loans have been internally classified as special mention or substandard  yet are not currently considered past due  impaired or in non accrual status 
management has identified potential credit problems which may result in the borrowers not being able to comply with the current loan repayment terms and which may result in it being included in future past due reporting 
management believes that the current allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover probable credit losses in the current loan portfolio 
in the normal course of business  pathfinder bank has sold residential mortgage loans and participation interests in commercial loans 
as is typical in the industry  the bank makes certain representations and warranties to the buyer 
pathfinder maintains a quality control program for closed loans and has never been asked to repurchase a sold loan 
therefore  management considers the risks and uncertainties associated with potential repurchase requirements to be minimal 
there are no known or alleged defects in the securitization process or in the mortgage documentation 
any future risk of exposure would be immaterial 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is established through charges to expense in the form of a provision for loan losses and reduced by loan charge offs net of recoveries 
the allowance for loan losses represents the amount available for probable credit losses in the company s loan portfolio as estimated by management 
the company maintains an allowance for loan losses based upon a monthly evaluation of known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio  which includes a review of the balances and composition of the loan portfolio as well as analyzing the level of delinquencies in each segment of the loan portfolio 
the company uses a general allocation method for the residential real estate and consumer loan pools  based upon a methodology that uses loss factors applied to loan balances and reflects actual loss experience  delinquency trends and current economic conditions 
the company individually reviews commercial real estate and commercial loans greater than  that are not accruing interest and that are risk rated under the company s risk rating system as special mention  substandard  doubtful or loss to determine if the loans require an allowance for impairment 
large residential real estate loans may also be included in this individual loan review 
if impairment is noted  the company establishes a specific allocation 
the specific allocation is determined based on the most recent valuation of the loan s collateral and the customer s ability to pay 
for all other commercial real estate and commercial loans  the company uses the general allocation method that establishes an allowance for each risk rating category 
the general allocation method for commercial real estate and commercial loans considers the same factor s that are considered when evaluating residential real estate and consumer loan pools 
the allowance for loan losses reflects management s best estimate of probable loan losses at december  the allowance for loan losses at december  and was million and million  or and of total period end loans  respectively 
net loan charge offs were  during  as compared to  in the majority of the increase in current year charge off activity is the result of the write off of a  loan that was part of the largest non performing commercial relationship previously discussed
