risk factors our business has many risks 
factors that could materially adversely affect our business  financial position  operating results or liquidity and the trading price of our units are described below 
this information should be considered carefully  together with other information in this report and other reports and materials we file with the sec 
we may not have sufficient cash flow from operations to pay the quarterly distribution at the current distribution level  or at all  and future distributions to our unitholders may fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
we may not have sufficient cash flow from operations each quarter to pay the quarterly distribution at the current distribution level or at all 
under the terms of our limited liability company agreement  the amount of cash otherwise available for distribution will be reduced by our operating expenses and any cash reserve amounts that our board of directors establishes to provide for future operations  future capital expenditures  future debt service requirements and future cash distributions to our unitholders 
the amount of cash we can distribute on our units principally depends upon the amount of cash we generate from our operations  which will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on  among other things produced volumes of oil  natural gas and ngl  prices at which oil  natural gas and ngl production is sold  level of our operating costs  payment of interest  which depends on the amount of our indebtedness and the interest payable thereon  and level of our capital expenditures 
in addition  the actual amount of cash we will have available for distribution will depend on other factors  some of which are beyond our control  including availability of borrowings under our credit facility to pay distributions  the costs of acquisitions  if any  fluctuations in our working capital needs  timing and collectibility of receivables  restrictions on distributions contained in our credit facility and the indentures governing our senior notes and our original senior notes  as defined in note  prevailing economic conditions  access to credit or capital markets  renegotiation of our credit facility at or prior to maturity at existing or better terms and pricing  and the amount of cash reserves established by our board of directors for the proper conduct of our business 
as a result of these factors  the amount of cash we distribute to our unitholders may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and may be significantly less than the current distribution level  or the distribution may be suspended 

table of contents item a 
risk factors continued we actively seek to acquire oil and natural gas properties 
acquisitions involve potential risks that could adversely impact our future growth and our ability to increase or pay distributions at the current level  or at all 
any acquisition involves potential risks  including  among other things the risk that reserves expected to support the acquired assets may not be of the anticipated magnitude or may not be developed as anticipated  the risk of title defects discovered after closing  inaccurate assumptions about revenues and costs  including synergies  significant increases in our indebtedness and working capital requirements  an inability to transition and integrate successfully or timely the businesses we acquire  the cost of transition and integration of data systems and processes  the potential environmental problems and costs  the assumption of unknown liabilities  limitations on rights to indemnity from the seller  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  increased demands on existing personnel and on our corporate structure  disputes arising out of acquisitions  customer or key employee losses of the acquired businesses  and the failure to realize expected growth or profitability 
the scope and cost of these risks may ultimately be materially greater than estimated at the time of the acquisition 
further  our future acquisition costs may be higher than those we have achieved historically 
any of these factors could adversely impact our future growth and our ability to increase or pay distributions 
if we do not make future acquisitions on economically acceptable terms  then our growth and ability to increase distributions will be limited 
our ability to grow and to increase distributions to our unitholders is partially dependent on our ability to make acquisitions that result in an increase in available cash flow per unit 
we may be unable to make such acquisitions because we are unable to identify attractive acquisition candidates or negotiate acceptable purchase contracts with them  unable to obtain financing for these acquisitions on economically acceptable terms  or outbid by competitors 
in any such case  our future growth and ability to increase distributions will be limited 
furthermore  even if we do make acquisitions that we believe will increase available cash flow per unit  these acquisitions may nevertheless result in a decrease in available cash flow per unit 
we have significant indebtedness under our senior notes and original senior notes  as defined in note the indentures governing our senior notes and original senior notes and our credit facility have substantial restrictions and financial covenants and we may have difficulty obtaining additional credit  which could adversely affect our operations  our ability to make acquisitions and our ability to pay distributions to our unitholders 
as of december   we had an aggregate of approximately billion outstanding under our senior notes and our original senior notes with additional borrowing capacity of approximately billion under our credit facility 
as a result of our indebtedness  we will use a portion of our cash flow to pay interest and principal when due  which will reduce the cash available to finance our operations and other business activities and could limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate 

table of contents item a 
risk factors continued the credit facility restricts our ability to obtain additional financing  make investments  lease equipment  sell assets  enter into commodity and interest rate derivative contracts and engage in business combinations 
we are also required to comply with certain financial covenants and ratios under our credit facility and the indentures governing our senior notes and our original senior notes 
our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants in the future is uncertain and will be affected by the levels of cash flow from our operations and events or circumstances beyond our control 
our failure to comply with any of the restrictions and covenants could result in an event of default  which  if it continues beyond any applicable cure periods  could cause all of our existing indebtedness to be immediately due and payable 
we depend  in part  on our credit facility for future capital needs 
we have drawn on our credit facility to fund or partially fund quarterly cash distribution payments  since we use operating cash flow for drilling and development of oil and natural gas properties and acquisitions and borrow as cash is needed 
absent such borrowing  we would have at times experienced a shortfall in cash available to pay our declared quarterly cash distribution amount 
if there is a default by us under our credit facility that continues beyond any applicable cure period  we would be unable to make borrowings to fund distributions 
in addition  we may finance acquisitions through borrowings under our credit facility or the incurrence of additional debt 
to the extent that we are unable to incur additional debt under our credit facility or otherwise because we are not in compliance with the financial covenants in the credit facility  we may not be able to complete acquisitions  which could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase distributions 
furthermore  to the extent we are unable to refinance our credit facility on terms that are as favorable as those in our existing credit facility  or at all  our ability to fund our operations and our ability to pay distributions could be affected 
the borrowing base under our credit facility is determined semi annually at the discretion of the lenders and is based in part on oil  natural gas and ngl prices 
significant declines in oil  natural gas or ngl prices may result in a decrease in our borrowing base 
the lenders can unilaterally adjust the borrowing base and therefore the borrowings permitted to be outstanding under the credit facility 
any increase in the borrowing base requires the consent of all the lenders 
outstanding borrowings in excess of the borrowing base must be repaid immediately  or we must pledge other properties as additional collateral 
we do not currently have substantial unpledged properties  and we may not have the financial resources in the future to make any mandatory principal prepayments required under the credit facility 
significant declines in our production or significant declines in realized oil  natural gas or ngl prices for prolonged periods and resulting decreases in our borrowing base may force us to reduce or suspend distributions to our unitholders 
our ability to access the capital and credit markets to raise capital on favorable terms will be affected by our debt level and by disruptions in the capital and credit markets  which could adversely affect our operations  our ability to make acquisitions and our ability to pay distributions to our unitholders 
disruptions in the capital and credit markets could limit our ability to access these markets or significantly increase our cost to borrow 
some lenders may increase interest rates  enact tighter lending standards  refuse to refinance existing debt at maturity on favorable terms or at all and may reduce or cease to provide funding to borrowers 
if we are unable to access the capital and credit markets on favorable terms  our ability to make acquisitions and pay distributions could be affected 
our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk  which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly 
borrowings under our credit facility bear interest at variable rates and expose us to interest rate risk 
if interest rates increase and we are unable to effectively hedge our interest rate risk  our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same  and our net income and cash available for servicing our indebtedness would decrease 

table of contents item a 
risk factors continued increases in interest rates could adversely affect the demand for our units 
an increase in interest rates may cause a corresponding decline in demand for equity investments  in particular for yield based equity investments such as our units 
any such reduction in demand for our units resulting from other more attractive investment opportunities may cause the trading price of our units to decline 
our commodity derivative activities could result in financial losses or could reduce our income  which may adversely affect our ability to pay distributions to our unitholders 
to achieve more predictable cash flow and to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in the prices of oil and natural gas  we enter into commodity derivative contracts for a significant portion of our production 
commodity derivative arrangements expose us to the risk of financial loss in some circumstances  including situations when production is less than expected 
if we experience a sustained material interruption in our production or if we are unable to perform our drilling activity as planned  we might be forced to satisfy all or a portion of our derivative obligations without the benefit of the cash flow from our sale of the underlying physical commodity  resulting in a substantial reduction of our liquidity  which may adversely affect our ability to pay distributions to our unitholders 
disruptions in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect our derivative positions 
we cannot be assured that our counterparties will be able to perform under our derivative contracts 
if a counterparty fails to perform and the derivative arrangement is terminated  our cash flow and ability to pay distributions could be impacted 
commodity prices are volatile  and a significant decline in commodity prices for a prolonged period would reduce our revenues  cash flow from operations and profitability and we may have to lower our distribution or may not be able to pay distributions at all 
our revenue  profitability and cash flow depend upon the prices of and demand for oil  natural gas and ngl 
the oil  natural gas and ngl market is very volatile and a drop in prices can significantly affect our financial results and impede our growth 
changes in oil  natural gas and ngl prices have a significant impact on the value of our reserves and on our cash flow 
prices for these commodities may fluctuate widely in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for them  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control  such as the domestic and foreign supply of and demand for oil  natural gas and ngl  the price and level of foreign imports  the level of consumer product demand  weather conditions  overall domestic and global economic conditions  political and economic conditions in oil and natural gas producing countries  including those in the middle east and south america  the ability of members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries to agree to and maintain price and production controls  the impact of the us dollar exchange rates on oil  natural gas and ngl prices  technological advances affecting energy consumption  domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxation  the impact of energy conservation efforts  the proximity and capacity of pipelines and other transportation facilities  and the price and availability of alternative fuels 
in the past  the prices of oil  natural gas and ngl have been extremely volatile  and we expect this volatility to continue 
if commodity prices decline significantly for a prolonged period  our cash flow from operations will decline  and we may have to lower our distribution or may not be able to pay distributions at all 

table of contents item a 
risk factors continued future price declines or downward reserve revisions may result in a write down of our asset carrying values  which could adversely affect our results of operations and limit our ability to borrow funds 
declines in oil  natural gas and ngl prices may result in our having to make substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves 
if this occurs  or if our estimates of development costs increase  production data factors change or drilling results deteriorate  accounting rules may require us to write down  as a noncash charge to earnings  the carrying value of our properties for impairments 
we capitalize costs to acquire  find and develop our oil and natural gas properties under the successful efforts accounting method 
we are required to perform impairment tests on our assets periodically and whenever events or changes in circumstances warrant a review of our assets 
to the extent such tests indicate a reduction of the estimated useful life or estimated future cash flows of our assets  the carrying value may not be recoverable and therefore would require a write down 
we may incur impairment charges in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period incurred and on our ability to borrow funds under our credit facility  which in turn may adversely affect our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders 
unless we replace our reserves  our reserves and production will decline  which would adversely affect our cash flow from operations and our ability to make distributions to our unitholders 
producing oil  natural gas and ngl reservoirs are characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors 
the overall rate of decline for our production will change if production from our existing wells declines in a different manner than we have estimated and can change when we drill additional wells  make acquisitions and under other circumstances 
thus  our future oil  natural gas and ngl reserves and production and  therefore  our cash flow and income  are highly dependent on our success in efficiently developing our current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves 
we may not be able to develop  find or acquire additional reserves to replace our current and future production at acceptable costs  which would adversely affect our cash flow from operations and our ability to make distributions to our unitholders 
our estimated reserves are based on many assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate 
any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves 
no one can measure underground accumulations of oil  natural gas and ngl in an exact manner 
reserve engineering requires subjective estimates of underground accumulations of oil  natural gas and ngl and assumptions concerning future oil  natural gas and ngl prices  production levels and operating and development costs 
as a result  estimated quantities of proved reserves and projections of future production rates and the timing of development expenditures may prove to be inaccurate 
independent petroleum engineering firms prepare estimates of our proved reserves 
some of our reserve estimates are made without the benefit of a lengthy production history  which are less reliable than estimates based on a lengthy production history 
also  we make certain assumptions regarding future oil  natural gas and ngl prices  production levels and operating and development costs that may prove incorrect 
any significant variance from these assumptions by actual amounts could greatly affect our estimates of reserves  the economically recoverable quantities of oil  natural gas and ngl attributable to any particular group of properties  the classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of the future net cash flows 
numerous changes over time to the assumptions on which our reserve estimates are based  as described above  often result in the actual quantities of oil  natural gas and ngl we ultimately recover being different from our reserve estimates 
the present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves is not necessarily the same as the current market value of our estimated oil  natural gas and ngl reserves 
we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on an unweighted average of the first day of the month price for each month during the month calendar year and year end costs 
however  actual future net cash flows from our oil and natural gas properties also will be affected by factors such as actual prices we receive for oil  natural gas and ngl  
table of contents item a 
risk factors continued the amount and timing of actual production  the timing and success of development activities  supply of and demand for oil  natural gas and ngl  and changes in governmental regulations or taxation 
in addition  the discount factor required to be used under the provisions of applicable accounting standards when calculating discounted future net cash flows  may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and natural gas industry in general 
our development operations require substantial capital expenditures  which will reduce our cash available for distribution 
we may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms  which could lead to a decline in our reserves 
the oil and natural gas industry is capital intensive 
we make and expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures in our business for the development  production and acquisition of oil  natural gas and ngl reserves 
these expenditures will reduce our cash available for distribution 
we intend to finance our future capital expenditures with cash flow from operations and our financing arrangements 
our cash flow from operations and access to capital are subject to a number of variables  including our proved reserves  the level of oil  natural gas and ngl we are able to produce from existing wells  the prices at which we are able to sell our oil  natural gas and ngl  and our ability to acquire  locate and produce new reserves 
if our revenues or the borrowing base under our credit facility decrease as a result of lower oil  natural gas and ngl prices  operating difficulties  declines in reserves or for any other reason  we may have limited ability to obtain the capital necessary to sustain our operations at current levels 
our credit facility restricts our ability to obtain new financing 
if additional capital is needed  we may not be able to obtain debt or equity financing on terms favorable to us  or at all 
if cash generated by operations or available under our credit facility is not sufficient to meet our capital requirements  the failure to obtain additional financing could result in a curtailment of our development operations  which in turn could lead to a possible decline in our reserves 
we may decide not to drill some of the prospects we have identified  and locations that we decide to drill may not yield oil  natural gas and ngl in commercially viable quantities 
our prospective drilling locations are in various stages of evaluation  ranging from a prospect that is ready to drill to a prospect that will require additional geological and engineering analysis 
based on a variety of factors  including future oil  natural gas and ngl prices  the generation of additional seismic or geological information  the availability of drilling rigs and other factors  we may decide not to drill one or more of these prospects 
as a result  we may not be able to increase or maintain our reserves or production  which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and our ability to pay distributions 
in addition  the sec s reserve reporting rules include a general requirement that  subject to limited exceptions  proved undeveloped reserves may only be booked if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years of the date of booking 
at december   we had  proved undeveloped drilling locations 
to the extent that we do not drill these locations within five years of initial booking  they may not continue to qualify for classification as proved reserves  and we may be required to reclassify such reserves as unproved reserves 
the reclassification of such reserves could also have a negative effect on the borrowing base under our credit facility 
the cost of drilling  completing and operating a well is often uncertain  and cost factors can adversely affect the economics of a well 
our efforts will be uneconomic if we drill dry holes or wells that are productive but do not produce enough oil  natural gas and ngl to be commercially viable after drilling  operating and other costs 
if we drill future wells that we identify as dry holes  our drilling success rate would decline  which could have an adverse effect on our business  financial position or results of operations 

table of contents item a 
risk factors continued our business depends on gathering and transportation facilities 
any limitation in the availability of those facilities would interfere with our ability to market the oil  natural gas and ngl we produce  and could reduce our cash available for distribution and adversely impact expected increases in oil  natural gas and ngl production from our drilling program 
the marketability of our oil  natural gas and ngl production depends in part on the availability  proximity and capacity of gathering and pipeline systems 
the amount of oil  natural gas and ngl that can be produced and sold is subject to limitation in certain circumstances  such as pipeline interruptions due to scheduled and unscheduled maintenance  excessive pressure  physical damage to the gathering or transportation system  or lack of contracted capacity on such systems 
the curtailments arising from these and similar circumstances may last from a few days to several months 
in many cases  we are provided only with limited  if any  notice as to when these circumstances will arise and their duration 
in addition  some of our wells are drilled in locations that are not serviced by gathering and transportation pipelines  or the gathering and transportation pipelines in the area may not have sufficient capacity to transport additional production 
as a result  we may not be able to sell the oil  natural gas and ngl production from these wells until the necessary gathering and transportation systems are constructed 
any significant curtailment in gathering system or pipeline capacity  or significant delay in the construction of necessary gathering and transportation facilities  would interfere with our ability to market the oil  natural gas and ngl we produce  and could reduce our cash available for distribution and adversely impact expected increases in oil  natural gas and ngl production from our drilling program 
we depend on certain key customers for sales of our oil  natural gas and ngl 
to the extent these and other customers reduce the volumes they purchase from us or delay payment  our revenues and cash available for distribution could decline 
further  a general increase in nonpayment could have an adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 
for the year ended december   dcp midstream partners  lp  enbridge energy partners  lp and conocophillips accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our total volumes  or in the aggregate 
for the year ended december   dcp midstream partners  lp  enbridge energy partners  lp and conocophillips accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our total volumes  or in the aggregate 
to the extent these and other customers reduce the volumes of oil  natural gas or ngl that they purchase from us  our revenues and cash available for distribution could decline 
many of our leases are in areas that have been partially depleted or drained by offset wells 
our key project areas are located in some of the most active drilling areas of the producing basins in the us as a result  many of our leases are in areas that have already been partially depleted or drained by earlier offset drilling 
this may inhibit our ability to find economically recoverable quantities of reserves in these areas 
our identified drilling location inventories are scheduled out over several years  making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling  resulting in temporarily lower cash from operations  which may impact our ability to pay distributions 
our management has specifically identified and scheduled drilling locations as an estimation of our future multi year drilling activities on our existing acreage 
as of december   we had identified  drilling locations  of which  were proved undeveloped locations and  were other locations 
these identified drilling locations represent a significant part of our growth strategy 
our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of factors  including the availability of capital  seasonal conditions  regulatory approvals  oil  natural gas and ngl prices  costs and drilling results 
in addition  degolyer and macnaughton has not estimated proved reserves for the  other drilling locations we have identified and scheduled for drilling  and therefore there may be greater uncertainty with respect to the success of drilling wells at these drilling locations 
our final determination on whether to drill any of these drilling locations will be dependent upon the factors described above as well as  to some degree  the results of our drilling activities with respect to our proved drilling locations 
because of these uncertainties  we do not know if the numerous drilling locations we have identified will be drilled within our expected timeframe or will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce oil  natural gas and ngl from these or 
table of contents item a 
risk factors continued any other potential drilling locations 
as such  our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified  which could adversely affect our business 
drilling for and producing oil  natural gas and ngl are high risk activities with many uncertainties that could adversely affect our financial position or results of operations and  as a result  our ability to pay distributions to our unitholders 
our drilling activities are subject to many risks  including the risk that we will not discover commercially productive reservoirs 
drilling for oil  natural gas and ngl can be uneconomic  not only from dry holes  but also from productive wells that do not produce sufficient revenues to be commercially viable 
in addition  our drilling and producing operations may be curtailed  delayed or canceled as a result of other factors  including the high cost  shortages or delivery delays of equipment and services  unexpected operational events  adverse weather conditions  facility or equipment malfunctions  title problems  pipeline ruptures or spills  compliance with environmental and other governmental requirements  unusual or unexpected geological formations  loss of drilling fluid circulation  formations with abnormal pressures  fires  blowouts  craterings and explosions  and uncontrollable flows of oil  natural gas and ngl or well fluids 
any of these events can cause increased costs or restrict our ability to drill the wells and conduct the operations which we currently have planned 
any delay in the drilling program or significant increase in costs could impact our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to pay quarterly distributions to our unitholders at the current distribution level or at all 
increased costs could include losses from personal injury or loss of life  damage to or destruction of property  natural resources and equipment  pollution  environmental contamination  loss of wells and regulatory penalties 
we ordinarily maintain insurance against certain losses and liabilities arising from our operations 
however  it is impossible to insure against all operational risks in the course of our business 
additionally  we may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the perceived risks presented 
losses could therefore occur for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage 
the occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse impact on our business activities  financial position and results of operations 
because we handle oil  natural gas and ngl and other hydrocarbons  we may incur significant costs and liabilities in the future resulting from a failure to comply with new or existing environmental regulations or an accidental release of hazardous substances into the environment 
the operations of our wells  gathering systems  turbines  pipelines and other facilities are subject to stringent and complex federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
these include  for example the federal clean air act and comparable state laws and regulations that impose obligations related to air emissions  the federal clean water act and comparable state laws and regulations that impose obligations related to discharges of pollutants into regulated bodies of water  the federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra  and comparable state laws that impose requirements for the handling and disposal of waste from our facilities  and the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of cercla  also known as superfund  and comparable state laws that regulate the cleanup of hazardous substances that 
table of contents item a 
risk factors continued may have been released at properties currently or previously owned or operated by us or at locations to which we have sent waste for disposal 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative  civil and criminal enforcement measures  including the assessment of monetary penalties  the imposition of remedial requirements  and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations 
certain environmental statutes  including the rcra  cercla and analogous state laws and regulations  impose strict  joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where hazardous substances have been disposed of or otherwise released 
moreover  it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other waste products into the environment 
there is an inherent risk that we may incur environmental costs and liabilities due to the nature of our business and the substances we handle 
for example  an accidental release from one of our wells or gathering pipelines could subject us to substantial liabilities arising from environmental cleanup and restoration costs  claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury and property damage and fines or penalties for related violations of environmental laws or regulations 
moreover  the possibility exists that stricter laws  regulations or enforcement policies could significantly increase our compliance costs and the cost of any remediation that may become necessary  and these costs may not be recoverable from insurance 
for a more detailed discussion of environmental and regulatory matters impacting our business  see item business environmental matters and regulation 
we are subject to complex federal  state  local and other laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost  manner or feasibility of doing business 
our operations are regulated extensively at the federal  state and local levels 
environmental and other governmental laws and regulations have increased the costs to plan  design  drill  install  operate and abandon oil and natural gas wells 
under these laws and regulations  we could also be liable for personal injuries  property damage and other damages 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative  civil and criminal penalties 
moreover  public interest in environmental protection has increased in recent years  and environmental organizations have opposed  with some success  certain drilling projects 
part of the regulatory environment in which we operate includes  in some cases  legal requirements for obtaining environmental assessments  environmental impact studies and or plans of development before commencing drilling and production activities 
in addition  our activities are subject to the regulations regarding conservation practices and protection of correlative rights 
these regulations affect our operations and limit the quantity of oil  natural gas and ngl we may produce and sell 
a major risk inherent in our drilling plans is the need to obtain drilling permits from state and local authorities 
delays in obtaining regulatory approvals or drilling permits  the failure to obtain a drilling permit for a well or the receipt of a permit with unreasonable conditions or costs could have a material adverse effect on our ability to develop our properties 
additionally  the regulatory environment could change in ways that might substantially increase the financial and managerial costs of compliance with these laws and regulations and  consequently  adversely affect our ability to pay distributions to our unitholders 
for a description of the laws and regulations that affect us  see item business environmental matters and regulation 
federal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and operating restrictions or delays 
hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons from tight formations 
the process involves the injection of water  sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production 
hydraulic fracturing operations have historically been overseen by state regulators as part of their oil and gas regulatory programs 
however  bills have recently been introduced in congress that would subject hydraulic fracturing to federal regulation under the safe drinking water 
table of contents item a 
risk factors continued act 
if adopted  these bills could result in additional permitting requirements for hydraulic fracturing operations as well as various restrictions on those operations 
these permitting requirements and restrictions could result in delays in operations at well sites as well as increased costs to make wells productive 
moreover  the bills introduced in congress would require the public disclosure of certain information regarding the chemical makeup of hydraulic fracturing fluids  many of which are proprietary to the service companies that perform the hydraulic fracturing operations 
in addition  the epa has commenced a study of the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing activities  with results of the study anticipated to be available by late  and a committee of the us house of representatives is also conducting an investigation of hydraulic fracturing practices 
moreover  some states have adopted  and other states are considering adopting  regulations that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances 
for example  new york has imposed a de facto moratorium on the issuance of permits for high volume  horizontal hydraulic fracturing until state administered environmental studies are finalized  a draft of which must be published by june   followed by a day comment period 
meanwhile  pennsylvania has adopted a variety of regulations limiting how and where fracturing can be performed 
although we do not currently operate in new york or pennsylvania  any such added regulation in states where we operate could lead to operational delays  increased operating costs and additional regulatory burdens  and reduced production of natural gas and oil  which could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
we may issue additional units without unitholder approval  which would dilute existing ownership interests 
we may issue an unlimited number of limited liability company interests of any type  including units  without the approval of our unitholders 
the issuance of additional units or other equity securities may have the following effects an individual unitholder s proportionate ownership interest in us may decrease  the relative voting strength of each previously outstanding unit may be reduced  the amount of cash available for distribution per unit may decrease  and the market price of the units may decline 
our management may have conflicts of interest with the unitholders 
our limited liability company agreement limits the remedies available to our unitholders in the event unitholders have a claim relating to conflicts of interest 
conflicts of interest may arise between our management on one hand  and the company and our unitholders on the other hand  related to the divergent interests of our management 
situations in which the interests of our management may differ from interests of our nonaffiliated unitholders include  among others  the following situations our limited liability company agreement gives our board of directors broad discretion in establishing cash reserves for the proper conduct of our business  which will affect the amount of cash available for distribution 
for example  our management will use its reasonable discretion to establish and maintain cash reserves sufficient to fund our drilling program  our management team  subject to oversight from our board of directors  determines the timing and extent of our drilling program and related capital expenditures  asset purchases and sales  borrowings  issuances of additional units and reserve adjustments  all of which will affect the amount of cash that we distribute to our unitholders  and affiliates of our directors are not prohibited from investing or engaging in other businesses or activities that compete with the company 

table of contents item a 
risk factors continued we do not have the same flexibility as other types of organizations to accumulate cash and equity to protect against illiquidity in the future 
unlike a corporation  our limited liability company agreement requires us to make quarterly distributions to our unitholders of all available cash reduced by any amounts of reserves for commitments and contingencies  including capital and operating costs and debt service requirements 
the value of our units may decrease in direct correlation with decreases in the amount we distribute per unit 
accordingly  if we experience a liquidity problem in the future  we may have difficulty issuing more equity to recapitalize 
our tax treatment depends on our status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes  as well as our not being subject to a material amount of entity level taxation by individual states 
if the internal revenue service irs were to treat us as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or we were to become subject to entity level taxation for state tax purposes  taxes paid  if any  would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution 
the anticipated after tax economic benefit of an investment in our units depends largely on our being treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes 
we have not requested  and do not plan to request  a ruling from the irs on this or any other tax matter that affects us 
if we were treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes  we would pay federal income tax on our taxable income at the corporate tax rates  currently at a maximum rate of 
distributions would generally be taxed again as corporate distributions  and no income  gain  loss  deduction or credit would flow through to unitholders 
because a tax may be imposed on us as a corporation  our cash available for distribution to our unitholders could be reduced 
therefore  treatment of us as a corporation would result in a material reduction in the anticipated cash flow and after tax return to our unitholders  likely causing a substantial reduction in the value of our units 
current law or our business may change so as to cause us to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or otherwise subject us to entity level taxation 
any modification to current law or interpretations thereof may or may not be applied retroactively and could make it more difficult or impossible to meet the requirements for partnership status  affect or cause us to change our business activities  affect the tax considerations of an investment in us  change the character or treatment of portions of our income and adversely affect an investment in our units 
in addition  because of widespread state budget deficits and other reasons  several states are evaluating ways to subject partnerships and limited liability companies to entity level taxation through the imposition of state income  franchise or other forms of taxation 
for example  we are required to pay texas franchise tax at a maximum effective rate of of our total revenue apportioned to texas in the prior year 
imposition of a tax on us by any other state would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our unitholders 
the value of an investment in our units could be affected by recent and potential federal tax increases 
absent new legislation extending the current rates  in taxable years beginning after december   the highest marginal us federal income tax rate applicable to ordinary income and long term capital gains of individuals will increase to and  respectively 
moreover  these rates are subject to change by new legislation at any time 
the recently enacted health care and education reconciliation act of includes a provision that  in taxable years beginning after december   subjects certain individuals  estates and trusts to an unearned income medicare contribution tax of on certain income 
in the case of an individual having a modified adjusted gross income in excess of  or  for married taxpayers filing joint returns  the provision imposes a tax equal to of the lesser of such excess and the individual s net investment income  which will include net income and gains from the ownership or disposition of our units

risk factors continued a successful irs contest of the federal income tax positions we take may adversely affect the market for our units  and the cost of an irs contest will reduce our cash available for distribution to our unitholders 
the irs may adopt tax positions that differ from the positions we take 
it may be necessary to resort to administrative or court proceedings to sustain some or all of the positions we take 
a court may not agree with some or all of the positions we take 
any contest with the irs may materially and adversely impact the market for our units and the price at which they trade 
in addition  the costs of any contest with the irs will be borne indirectly by our unitholders because the costs will reduce our cash available for distribution 
unitholders are required to pay taxes on their share of our taxable income  including their share of ordinary income and capital gain upon dispositions of properties by us  even if they do not receive any cash distributions from us 
a unitholder s share of our taxable income  gain  loss and deduction  or specific items thereof  may be substantially different than the unitholder s interest in our economic profits 
our unitholders are required to pay federal income taxes and  in some cases  state and local income taxes on their share of our taxable income  whether or not they receive cash distributions from us 
our unitholders may not receive cash distributions from us equal to their share of our taxable income or even equal to the actual tax liability that results from their share of our taxable income 
for example  we may sell a portion of our properties and use the proceeds to pay down debt or acquire other properties rather than distributing the proceeds to our unitholders  and some or all of our unitholders may be allocated substantial taxable income with respect to that sale 
a unitholder s share of our taxable income upon a disposition of property by us may be ordinary income or capital gain or some combination thereof 
even where we dispose of properties that are capital assets  what otherwise would be capital gains may be recharacterized as ordinary income in order to recapture ordinary deductions that were previously allocated to that unitholder related to the same property 
a unitholder s share of our taxable income and gain or specific items thereof may be substantially greater than  or our tax losses and deductions or specific items thereof may be substantially less than  the unitholder s interest in our economic profits 
this may occur  for example  in the case of a unitholder who purchases units at a time when the value of our units or of one or more of our properties is relatively low or a unitholder who acquires units directly from us in exchange for property whose fair market value exceeds its tax basis at the time of the exchange 
a unitholder s taxable gain or loss on the disposition of our units could be more or less than expected 
if unitholders sell their units  they will recognize a gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and their tax basis in those units 
prior distributions to our unitholders in excess of the total net taxable income they were allocated for a unit  which decreases their tax basis  will become taxable income to our unitholders if the unit is sold at a price greater than their tax basis in that unit  even if the price received is less than their original cost 
a substantial portion of the amount realized  whether or not representing gain  may be ordinary income 
in addition  if unitholders sell their units  they may incur a tax liability in excess of the amount of cash they receive from the sale 
if the irs successfully contests some positions we take  unitholders could recognize more gain on the sale of units than would be the case under those positions  without the benefit of decreased income in prior years 
tax exempt entities and non us persons face unique tax issues from owning our units that may result in adverse tax consequences to them 
investment in units by tax exempt entities  such as individual retirement accounts known as iras and other retirement plans  and non us persons raises issues unique to them 
for example  virtually all of our income allocated to organizations that are exempt from federal income tax  including iras and other retirement plans  will be unrelated business taxable income and will be taxable to them 
distributions to non us persons will be reduced by withholding taxes at the highest applicable effective tax rate  and non us persons will be required to file us federal tax returns and pay tax on their share of our taxable income

risk factors continued we treat each purchaser of units as having the same tax benefits without regard to the units purchased 
the irs may challenge this treatment  which could adversely affect the value of the units 
because we cannot match transferors and transferees of units  we must maintain uniformity of the economic and tax characteristics of our units to a purchaser of units 
we take depletion  depreciation and amortization positions that are intended to maintain such uniformity 
these depletion  depreciation and amortization positions may not conform with all aspects of existing treasury regulations 
a successful irs challenge to those positions could adversely affect the amount of tax benefits available to our unitholders 
it also could affect the timing of these tax benefits or the amount of gain from unitholders sale of units and could have a negative impact on the value of our units or result in audit adjustments to unitholder tax returns 
the sale or exchange of or more of our capital and profits interests within a month period will result in the deemed termination of our tax partnership for federal income tax purposes 
we will be considered to have terminated for federal income tax purposes if there is a sale or exchange of or more of the total interests in our capital and profits within a month period 
our termination would  among other things  result in the closing of our taxable year for all unitholders and could result in a deferral of depreciation deductions allowable in computing our taxable income 
if this occurs  our unitholders will be allocated an increased amount of federal taxable income for the year in which we are considered to be terminated as a percentage of the cash distributed to the unitholders with respect to that period 
we prorate our items of income  gain  loss and deduction between transferors and transferees of our units each month or in some cases for periods shorter than a month based upon the ownership of our units on the first day of each month or shorter period  instead of on the basis of the date a particular unit is transferred 
the irs may challenge this treatment  which could change the allocation of items of income  gain  loss and deduction among our unitholders 
we prorate our items of income  gain  loss and deduction between transferors and transferees of our units each month or in some cases for periods shorter than a month based upon the ownership of our units on the first day of each month or shorter period  instead of on the basis of the date a particular unit is transferred 
the use of this proration method may not be permitted under existing treasury regulations 
if the irs were to challenge this method or new treasury regulations were issued  we may be required to change the allocation of items of income  gain  loss and deduction among our unitholders 
a unitholder whose units are loaned to a short seller to cover a short sale of units may be considered as having disposed of those units 
if so  the unitholder would no longer be treated for tax purposes as a partner with respect to those units during the period of the loan and may recognize gain or loss from the disposition 
because a unitholder whose units are loaned to a short seller to cover a short sale of units may be considered as having disposed of the loaned units  the unitholder may no longer be treated for tax purposes as a partner with respect to those units during the period of the loan to the short seller and the unitholder may recognize gain or loss from such disposition 
moreover  during the period of the loan to the short seller  any of our income  gain  loss  or deduction with respect to those units may not be reportable by the unitholder and any cash distributions received by the unitholder as to those units could be fully taxable as ordinary income 
unitholders desiring to assure their status as partners and avoid the risk of gain recognition from a loan to a short seller are urged to modify any applicable brokerage account agreements to prohibit their brokers from borrowing their units 
unitholders may be subject to state and local taxes and return filing requirements in states and jurisdictions where they do not live as a result of investing in our units 
in addition to federal income taxes  our unitholders will likely be subject to other taxes  including state and local taxes  unincorporated business taxes and estate  inheritance or intangible taxes that are imposed by the various jurisdictions in which we do business or own property now or in the future  even if they do not reside in any of those jurisdictions 
our unitholders will likely be required to file foreign  state and local income tax returns and pay state and local income taxes in some or all of these jurisdictions 
further  our unitholders may be subject to penalties for

as we make acquisitions or expand our business  we may do business or own assets in other states in the future 
it is the responsibility of each unitholder to file all us federal  state and local tax returns that may be required of such unitholder 
changes to current federal tax laws may affect unitholders ability to take certain tax deductions 
substantive changes to the existing federal income tax laws have been proposed that  if adopted  would affect  among other things  the ability to take certain operations related deductions  including deductions for intangible drilling and percentage depletion and deductions for us production activities 
other proposed changes may affect our ability to remain taxable as a partnership for federal income tax purposes 
we are unable to predict whether any changes  or other proposals to such laws  ultimately will be enacted 
any such changes could negatively impact the value of an investment in our units 
derivatives legislation enacted in could have an adverse impact on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price  interest rate and other risks associated with our business 
new comprehensive financial reform legislation was signed into law by the president on july  the legislation calls for the commodities futures trading commission the cftc to regulate certain markets for over the counter otc derivative products 
currently  rulemakings are pending at the cftc  the product of which would be rules that implement the mandates in the new legislation to cause significant portions of derivatives to clear through clearinghouses 
the significance of the effect on our business will depend in part on whether we are determined to be a major swap participant or swap dealer or a qualifying end user  as those terms are defined in the final rules 
depending on those determinations  we may be required to comply with margin requirements and with certain clearing and trade execution requirements in connection with our derivatives activities 
the cftc has proposed regulations that  if adopted  may provide to us the certainty that we will not be required to comply with margin requirements or clearing requirements  but the timing of any adoption of any such regulations  and their scope  are uncertain 
even if we are not deemed a major swap participant or swap dealer  the rules could impose burdens on market participants to such an extent that liquidity in the bilateral otc derivative market decreases substantially 
the legislation may also require counterparties to our derivative instruments to spin off some of their derivatives activities to separate entities  which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparties 
the new legislation and any new regulations  including determinations with respect to the applicability of margin requirements and other trading structures  could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts  materially alter the terms of derivative contracts  reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter  reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts  and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties 
if we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the legislation and regulations  our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable  which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures and to generate sufficient cash flow to pay quarterly distributions at the current levels or at all 
our revenues could be adversely affected if a consequence of the legislation and regulations is to lower commodity prices 
any of these consequences could have a material  adverse effect on us  our financial condition  and our results of operations
