item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations operations research and development expenses for a description of our research and development expenses for the past two fiscal years 
over time  we plan to leverage our patent portfolio to develop a product suite that can be sold to enterprise customers and developers 

index our primary source of income since our inception has been from the settlement and license agreement we entered into with microsoft corporation  our first licensee  on may   or the settlement and license agreement 
pursuant to the settlement and license agreement  microsoft paid us  in june as a result we dismissed the two patent infringement lawsuits we had initiated against microsoft in february and march and granted microsoft a worldwide  irrevocable  nonexclusive  non sub licensable fully paid up license for our patents 
the settlement and license agreement with microsoft will not impact our plans to operate a secure domain name service 
on august   we initiated a lawsuit by filing a complaint against aastra  apple  cisco  nec in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas  tyler division  pursuant to which we allege that these parties infringe on certain of our patents 
we seek damages and injunctive relief 
on january   we initiated a lawsuit by filing a complaint against siemens and mitel in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas  tyler division  pursuant to which we allege that these companies infringe two of our patents 
we seek damages and injunctive relief 
we intend to license our patents and our gabriel connection technology to original equipment manufacturers  or oems  within the ip telephony  mobility  fixed mobile convergence and unified communications markets 
the beta testing of our gabriel connection technology has now become part of our secure domain name initiative  or sdni  that was announced on april  we have been in active discussions with leading g lte companies domain infrastructure providers  chipset manufacturers  service providers  and others to participate in a design pilot program for delivering to end users and consumers of the internet and mobile devices the needed and necessary security requirements for the next generation g lte wireless networks 
we expect that the design pilot program will implement our patented s ecure domain name and our gabriel connection technology 
we also intend to license our technology and software  including our secure domain name registry service  to communication service providers as well as to system integrators 
we believe that the market opportunity for our software and technology solutions is large and expanding 
industry overview the internet is increasingly evolving into a rich medium used by individuals and businesses to conduct commerce  share information and engage in real time communications including email  text messaging  im  and voice and video calls 
this communications experience is richer and more complex than ever before 
session initiation protocol  or sip  was developed to enable the convergence of voice and data networks and today is the predominant industry standard for establishing multimedia communications over the internet such as voice  video  instant messaging  presence information and file transfer 
sip  as well as other real time collaboration protocols such as xmpp  use dns lookup as its primary means of connecting internet devices but is an open architecture that remains inherently unsecure 
we believe that accessing a diversity of services from a single device  anytime and anywhere  and the ability to access these same services from a range of devices are emerging as key market requirements 
the portions of the ip telephony  mobility  fixed mobile convergence and unified communications markets that could benefit from our software and technology solutions are forecasted by infonetics to grow from approximately billion of worldwide revenues in to approximately billion by  representing a compound annual growth rate  or cagr  of approximately 
we believe that this growing trend represents a significant opportunity for virnetx to license its technology and software  and establish its secure domain name registry 

index ip telephony ip telephony includes technologies that use internet protocol s packet switched connections to exchange voice  fax  and other forms of information traditionally carried over the dedicated circuit switched connections of the public switched telephone network  or pstn 
the adoption of ip telephony has helped businesses significantly lower network operating costs by using a common network for voice and data 
as the workforce becomes increasingly dispersed  mobile features enabled by internet protocol based communications such as presence  unified messaging  peer to peer applications  find me follow me  white boarding and document sharing have become more commonplace 
however  the development of the related security infrastructure has lagged behind  leaving next generation networks vulnerable to a multi tude of threats including man in middle  eavesdropping  domain hijacking  distributed denial of service  or ddos  spam over internet telephony  or spit  and spam over instant messaging  or spim 
these threats continue to highlight the need for securing next generation networks 
as the use of ip telephony systems extends beyond the boundaries of an organization s private network  security is likely to become an even bigger concern 
worldwide revenue from ip telephony products like ip pbx including ip phones  service provider voip and ims equipment  voip gateways and hosted voip services for businesses is forecasted by infonetics to grow from approximately billion in to approximately billion in  representing a cagr of approximately 
we believe our unique and patented solution provides the robust security platform required for providing on demand secure communication links between enterprises intending to communicate securely without manual ly configuring the connections 
we believe a standard security solution such as ours will further accelerate the adoption of ip telephony products in the market and allow enterprises to take full advantage of these rich content applications and real time communications over the internet  thereby significantly increasing their return on investment 
fixed mobile convergence fixed mobile convergence is an environment where wired and wireless phones work together with internet protocol to deliver services voice  video  data and combinations thereof uniformly across multiple access networks  including  among others  wimax  wifi  cellular and fixed 
we believe that worldwide revenue for fixed mobile convergence infrastructure equipment will grow from approximately million in to over million in  representing a cagr of approximately 
additionally  according to a thought leadership paper entitled road to full convergence published by fixed mobile convergence alliance  or fmca  an alliance of leading operators representing a customer base of over million customers  consumers increasingly feel the need to be connected and have real time access to media streams  blogs and breaking news 
during the past ten years  users have become increasingly technologically sophisticated and are now demanding greater functionality from the internet 
today  the internet is used for commerce  accessing content  social networking  online dating and a number of other forms of media rich  real time communication and collaboration 
mobile devices like dual mode cellular wifi phones lie at the center of this transition and have become the device with the closest proximity and relationship to the user 
we believe that accessing a diversity of services from a single device  anytime and anywhere  and the ability to access the same services from a range of devices  is emerging as a key market requirement 
worldwide total dual mode cellular wifi phone revenue was approximately billion in and is expected to grow to approximately billion in  representing a cagr of approximately 
the strong projec ted growth for converged cellular wifi phones and related services in enterprise and consumer market segments represents a significant opportunity for virnetx s technology  and software to become the industry standard for securing real time communication 
ip mobility smartphones are multi functional devices that handle a wide variety of business critical applications and support increasingly complex functions including enhanced data processing  internet access  e mail access  calendars and scheduling  contact management and the ability to view electronic documents 
users have continual access to these applications while on the move making them an increasingly essential business tool for the mobile worker 
these devices enable mobile workers to have similar functionality inside or outside the office thereby increasing employee efficiency 
however  it is critical that this mobile environment have the same level of security as an enterprise s internal network 
worldwide revenue from ip mobility products like smartphones and mobile data cards is expected to grow from approximately billion in to approximately billion by  representing a cagr of approximately 
we believe in order to realize the full functionality of ip mobility  several challenges including security must be overcome 
when users are mobile  connections and data need to cross multiple network boundaries  each of which poses a security threat 
wireless networks present unique threats because rogue users can enter the enterprise network through wireless access points that may not be sufficiently protected as part of an organization s it security protocols 
providing authenticated access to the wireless networks and enterprise applications through the wireless domain are important requirements and represent a significant market opportunity for virnetx s patented technology and secure domain names to provide users fully authenticated secure access on a zero click or single click basis 

index unified communications the need to enhance productivity is putting increasing demand on instant access to  and the management of  rapidly expanding real time information 
mobile collaboration  and the ability to conduct business whether inside or outside of the office  are high priorities 
business and consumer users are nomadic and expect instant access everywhere 
the ability to establish multiple secure simultaneous network connections and provide ip sessions with security and encryption will be critical to widespread deployment of next generation networks 
a shortcoming of this new communications environment is that the various modes of communication operate independently from one another and do not integrate easily  if at all 
as the number of devices grows  individual points of contact multiply and c ommunication becomes more sophisticated and increasingly vulnerable 
the idea behind unified communications is to organize the array of communication methodologies  integrating the various fragmented ways individuals communicate today into a single communications experience  ultimately increasing utility and productivity 
the basic components comprising unified communications include a directory for storing addresses  various modes of communication with each user contact desk phone  mobile phone  im  etc  message storage for all messages regardless of communication method and secure presence of a user s status for each mode of communication available  away  busy  etc worldwide unified communications market generated approximately million in revenue in and is forecasted to grow rapidly over the next few years generating approximately million in revenue in  representing a cagr of approximately 
we believe the growth in unified communication products may not reach its full potential due to the lack of transparent and seamless security as users hesitate to place their presence information online for all to see and as organizations block access due to the lack of credentials verified by a neutral third party 
our solutions help address these concerns and should enable significant growth in the unified communications market 
our solutions our software and technology solutions  including our secure domain name registry  our patents and our gabriel connection technology are designed to secure all types of real time communications over the internet

scalable licensing business model 
we are actively engaged in pursuing licensing agreements with oems  service providers and system integrators within the ip telephony  mobility  fixed mobile convergence and unified communications end markets 
highly experienced research and development team 
our research and development team is comprised of nationally recognized network security and encryption technology scientists and experts that have worked together as a team for over ten years 
during their careers  this team has developed several cutting edge technologies for us national defense  intelligence and civilian agencies  many of which remain critical to our national security today 
prior to joining virnetx  our team worked for saic during which time they invented the technology that is the foundation of our technology  and software 
based on the collective knowledge and experience of our development team  we believe that we have one of the most experienced and sophisticated groups of security experts researching vulnerability and threats to real time com munication over the internet and developing solutions to mitigate these problems 
our strategy our strategy is to become the market leader in securing real time communications over the internet and to establish our gabriel communications technology as the industry standard security platform 
key elements of our strategy are to 
index implement a technology licensing program to commercialize our intellectual property  including our gabriel connection technology 
establish virnetx as the exclusive universal registry of secure domain names and to enable our customers to act as registrars for their users and broker secure communication between users on different registries 
leverage our existing technology to develop a suite of products that can be sold directly to end user enterprises 
on december   we declared to the gpp rd generation partnership project that we believe our us and foreign patents are or may be essential to long term evolution lte and g wireless specifications 
we believe that we hold the patents relevant to compliance with the gpp series specifications that define security requirements for lte g networks 
license and service offerings we plan to offer a diversified portfolio of license and service offerings focused on securing real time communications over the internet  including virnetx technology licensing customers who want to develop their own implementation of the virnetx code module for supporting secure domain names  or who want to use their own techniques that are covered by our patent portfolio for establishing secure communication links  will purchase a technology license 
we anticipate that these licenses would typically include an initial license fee  as well as an ongoing royalty 
we expect that these licenses will include a one time delivery of gabriel software development kit including object libraries  sample code  testing and quality assurance tools and the supporting documentation necessary for a customer to implement of the techniques we have developed 
gabriel connection technology software development kit or sdk oem customers who want to adopt the gabriel connection technology as their solution for establishing secure connections using secure domain names within their products will purchase an sdk license 
the software development kit consists of object libraries  sample code  testing and quality assurance tools and the supporting documentation necessary for a customer to implement our technology 
these tools are comprised of software for a secure domain name connection test server  a relay test server and a registration test server 
we expect that customers would pay an up front license fee to purchase an sdk license and a royalty fee for every product shipped with the embedded virnetx code module 
secure domain name registrar service customers  including service providers  telecommunication companies  isps  system integrators and oems could purchase a license to our secure domain name registrar service 
we would provide the software suite and technology support to enable such customers to provision devices with secure domain names and facilitate secure connections between registered devices 
this suite includes the following server software modules o registrar server software we anticipate that our registrar server software would enable customers to operate as a secure domain name registrar that provisions devices with secure domain names 
the registrar server software is designed to provide an interface for our customers to register new virtual private domains and sub domain names 
this server module must be enrolled with the virnetx secure domain name master registry to obtain its credentials before functioning as an authorized registrar 
o connection server software we anticipate that our connection server software would allow customers to provide connection services to enrolled devices 
the connection services include registration of presence information for authenticated users and devices  presence information query request services  enforcement of policies and support for communication with peers behind firewalls 

index o relay server software we anticipate that our relay server software would allow customers to dynamically maintain connections and relay data to private ip addresses for network devices that reside behind firewalls 
secure domain name registrar service customers will enter into a technology licensing and revenue sharing agreement with virnetx whereby we will typically receive an up front licensing fee for the secure domain name registrar technology  as well as ongoing annual royalties for each secure domain name issued by the customer 
secure domain name master registry and connection service as part of enabling the secure domain name registrar service  we expect that we will maintain and manage the secure domain name master registry 
this service is expected to enroll all secure domain name registrar customers and generate the credentials required to function as an authorized registrar 
it also is expected to provide connection services and universal name resolution  presence information and secure connections between authorized devices with secure domain names 
technical support services we intend to provide high quality technical support services to licensees and customers for the rapid customization and deployment of gabriel connection technology in an individual customer s products and services 
our research and development team was the team responsible for inventing the claimed subject matter of the patents that form the foundation of our technology 
this team has worked together for over ten years 
we intend to leverage this experience and continue investing in research and development and  over time  expect to strengthen and expand our patent portfolio  technology  and software 
while we are currently focused on securing real time communications over the internet and establishing the first and only secure domain name registry  we believe our existing and future intellectual property portfolio will extend to additional areas including  among others  network security and operating systems for fixed and mobile devices 
customers our primary source of revenue since inception has been from the settlement and license agreement we entered into with microsoft corporation  our first licensee  on may   or the settlement and license agreement 
pursuant to the settlement and license agreement  microsoft paid us  in june as a consequence  we dismissed the two patent infringement lawsuits we initiated against microsoft in february and march and granted microsoft a worldwide  irrevocable  nonexclusive  non sub licensable fully paid up license under our patents 
the settlement and license agreement with microsoft will not impact our plans to operate a secure domain name service 
we are currently focused on commercializing our technology and are actively offering our gabriel connection technology to original equipment manufacturers  or oems  within the ip telephony  mobility  fixed mobile convergence and unified communications markets 
we also intend to provide technology licenses and software offerings  including our secure domain name registry service  to communication service providers as well as to system integrators 
marketing and sales we plan to employ a leveraged  partner oriented  marketing strategy for our technology licenses and software offerings 
we expect the marketing strategy will primarily be focused on oems 
we plan to directly market our domain name registry services to our service provider and system integrator customers 
we hope to leverage our relationship with saic to extend our offering to departments and agencies within the federal government 
saic is a fortune scientific  engineering  and technology applications company that uses its deep domain knowledge to solve problems of vital importance to the nation and the world  in national security  energy and the environment  critical infrastructure  and health 

index we intend to build a sales force that will be responsible for managing accounts and pursuing technology licensing and sales opportunities with new customers 
competition we believe our technology and solutions will compete primarily against various proprietary security solutions 
we group these solutions into three main categories proprietary or home grown application specific security solutions have been developed by vendors and integrated directly into their products for our target markets including ip telephony  mobility  fixed mobile convergence  and unified communications 
these proprietary solutions have been developed due to the lack of standardized approaches to securing real time communications 
this approach has led to corporate networks that are isolated and  as a result  restrict enterprises to using these next generation networks within the boundaries of their private network 
these solutions generally do not provide security for communications over the internet or require network administrators to manually exchange keys and other security parameters with each destination network outside their corporate network boundary 
the cost savings and other benefits of ip based real time communi cations are significantly limited by this approach to securing real time communications 
a session border controller  or sbc  is a device used in networks to exert control over the signaling and media streams involved in establishing  conducting and terminating voip calls 
a traditional firewall or network address translation  or nat  device typically block information like endpoint ip addresses and port numbers required by signaling protocols  such as sip and xmpp  to reach and communicate with their intended destination 
sbcs are used in physical networks to address these limitations and enable real time session traffic to cross the boundaries created by firewalls and other nat devices and enable voip calls to be established successfully 
however  sbcs must decrypt and analyze every single data packet for the information to be transmitted successfully  thereby preventing end to end encryption 
this network design results in sbcs becoming a single point of c ongestion on the network  as well as a single point of failure 
sbcs are also limited to the physical network they secure 
sip firewalls  or sip aware firewalls  and application layer gateways  manage and protect the traffic  flow and quality of voip and other sip related communications 
they perform real time network address translation  dynamic firewall functions  support multiple signaling protocols  and media functionality  allowing secure interconnection and the flow of ip media streams across multiple networks 
while sip firewalls assist in analyzing sip traffic transmitted over the corporate network to filter out various threats  they do not necessarily encrypt the traffic 
as a result  this traffic is not entirely secure from end to end nor is it protected against threats like man in middle and eavesdropping 
intellectual property and patent rights our intellectual property is primarily comprised of trade secrets  patented know how  issued and pending patents  copyrights and technological innovation 
we have a portfolio comprised of twelve patents in the united states and sixteen foreign patents  as well as several pending us and foreign patent applications 
our portfolio includes a number of patents that describe unique systems and methods for securing real time communications over the internet  as well as related services such as the establishment and maintenance of a secure domain name registry 
our software and technology solutions also have additional applications relating to operating systems and network security 

index we have included a list of our us patents below

assignment of patents most of our issued patents were acquired by our principal operating subsidiary  virnetx  inc  from science applications international corporation  or saic  pursuant to an assignment agreement dated december   and a patent license and assignment agreement dated august   as amended on november   including documents prepared pursuant to the november amendment  and as further amended on march  we are required to make payments to saic based on the revenue generated from our ownership or use of the patents we acquired from saic 
royalty amounts vary depending upon the type of revenue generating activities  and certain royalty categories are subject to maximums and other limitations 
with respect to revenue generating activities within our field of use  minimum annual royalty pay ments of  were due beginning in but as of june  we have met our maximum royalty payment 
under certain circumstances  saic is entitled to receive a portion of the proceeds from revenues  monies or any form of consideration paid to virnetx for certain acquisitions of virnetx or from the settlement of certain patent infringement claims we assert on others 
government regulation the laws governing online secure communications remain largely unsettled  even in areas where there has been legislative action 
it may take years to determine whether and how existing laws governing intellectual property  privacy and libel apply to online communications and media 
such legislation may interfere with the growth in use of online secure communications and decrease the acceptance of online secure communications as a viable solution  which could adversely affect our business 
due to the internet s popularity and increasing use  new laws regulating secure communications may be adopted 
these laws and regulations may cover  among other things  issues relating to privacy  pricing  taxation  telecommunications over the internet  content  copyrights  distribution and quality of products and services 
we intend to comply with all new laws and regulations as they are adopted 

index the us government has controlled the authoritative domain name system  or dns  root server since the inception of the internet 
on july   the president of the united states directed the us secretary of commerce to privatize the management of the domain name system in a manner that increases competition and facilitates international participation in its management 
on september   the us department of commerce extended its delegation of authority by entering into a new agreement with the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers  or icann  a california non profit corporation headquartered in marina del rey  california 
icann is responsible for managing the accreditation of registry providers and registrars that manage the assignment of top level domain names associated with the authoritative dns root directory 
although it is possible to create and manage other dns root directories privately without accreditation from icann  the possibility of conflicting name and number assignments makes it less likely that users would widely adopt a top level domain name associated with an alternative dns root directory provided by a non icann accredited registry service 
we are currently evaluating whether we will apply to become an icann accredited registry provider with respect to one or more customized gtlds  or create our own alternative dns root directory to manage the assignment of non standard secure domain names 
we have not yet begun discussions with icann and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in obtaining icann accreditation for our registry service on terms acceptable to us or at all 
whether or not we obtain accreditation from icann  we will be subject to the ongoing risks arising out of the delegation of the us government s responsibilities for the domain name system to the us department of commerce and icann and the evolving government regulatory environment with respect to domain name registry services

risk factors 
you should carefully consider the following material risks in addition to the other information set forth in the annual report on this form k before making any investment in the offered securities 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business 
if any of these risk factors occurs  you could lose substantial value or your entire investment in the offered securities 
risks related to existing and future litigation our litigation against aastra  apple  cisco  nec  siemens and mitel is ongoing  and we expect such litigation and the appeals process to be time consuming and costly  which may adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to operate our business 
on august   we initiated a lawsuit by filing a complaint against aastra  apple  cisco  nec in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas  tyler division  pursuant to which we allege that these parties infringe on certain of our patents 
we seek damages and injunctive relief 
on january   we initiated a lawsuit by filing a complaint against siemens and mitel in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas  tyler division  pursuant to which we allege that these companies infringe two of our patents 
we seek damages and injunctive relief 
we cannot assure you that any of these lawsuits will result in a final outcome that is favorable to our company or our stockholders 
we expect to allocate a significant amount of our existing cash on hand towards the fees and expenses associated these litigation matters 
we anticipate that these legal proceedings could continue for several years and may require significant expenditures for legal fees and other expenses 
in the event we are not successful through appeal and do not subsequently obtain monetary and injunctive relief  these litigation matters may significantly reduce our financial resources and have a material impact on our ability to continue our operations 
the time and effort required of our management to effectively pursue these litigation matters may adversely affect our ability to operate our business  since time spent on matters related to the lawsuits will take away from the time spent on managing and operating our business 
while we believe aastra  apple  cisco  nec  siemens and mitel infringe our patents  we can provide no assurance that we will be successful in our lawsuit through appeal 
we believe that aastra  apple  cisco  nec  siemens and mitel infringe on certain of our patents  but obtaining and collecting a judgment against these parties may be difficult or impossible 
patent litigation is inherently risky and the outcome is uncertain 
aastra  apple  cisco  nec  siemens and mitel are all large  well financed companies with substantially greater resources than us 
we believe that these parties will devote a substantial amount of resources in an attempt to prove that either their products do not infringe our patents or that our patents are not valid and are unenforceable 
at this time  we cannot predict the final outcome of these litigation matters 
we may commence additional legal proceedings against third parties who we believe are infringing on our intellectual property rights  and if we are forced to litigate to defend our intellectual property rights  or to defend claims by third parties against us relating to intellectual property rights  legal fees and court injunctions could adversely affect our financial condition or end our business 
disputes regarding the ownership of technologies and intellectual property rights are common and we may have intellectual property infringement claims against other parties in addition to our claims against aastra  apple inc  cisco  nec  siemens and mitel 
if we commence actions against additional parties  we may incur significant expense and commit significant management time  which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  there can be no assurance that we would be successful in any additional legal proceedings and the existence and outcome of any such litigation could harm our business 
in addition  commencing lawsuits may lead to potential counterclaims which may preclude our ability to develop and commercialize products 

index risks related to our business and our industry we may or may not be able to capitalize on potential market opportunities related to our licensing strategy or our patent portfolio 
in order to capitalize on our patent portfolio  our business strategy calls for us to enter into licensing relationships with the leading companies in our target market in order to reach a larger end user base than we could reach through direct sales and marketing efforts 
although we entered into a settlement and license agreement with microsoft corporation  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to capitalize on our patent portfolio or any potential market opportunity in the foreseeable future 
our inability to generate licensing revenues associated with the potential market opportunity could result from a number of factors  including  but not limited to we may not be successful in entering into licensing relationships with our targeted customers on commercially acceptable terms  and challenges to the validity of certain of our patents underlying our licensing opportunities 
we can provide no assurance that we will be successful in pursuing our business plan of commercializing our technology 
we expect to depend on our intellectual property licensing fees and royalties for the majority of our revenues 
our ability to generate licensing fees and royalties is dependent on mainstream market adoption of real time communications based on session initiation protocol or using dns lookup protocols as well as customer adoption of our gabriel communication technology and our secure domain name registry 
we cannot assure you that we will succeed in building a profitable business based on our business plan 
there has been increased competition for security solutions in the real time communications industry  as more companies seek to provide products and services similar to our proposed products and services  and because larger and better financed competitors may affect our ability to operate our business and achieve profitability  our business may fail 
we expect competition for our products and services to be intense 
we expect to compete directly against other companies offering similar security products and services that will compete directly with our proposed products and services 
we also expect that we will compete against established vendors within the ip telephony  mobility  fixed mobile convergence and unified communications markets 
these companies may incorporate other competitive technologies into their product offerings  whether developed internally or by third parties 
for the foreseeable future  substantially all of our competitors are likely to be larger  better financed companies that may develop products superior to our proposed products  which could create significant competitive advantages for those companies 
ou r future success depends on our ability to compete effectively with our competitors 
as a result  we may have difficulty competing with larger  established competitors 
generally  these competitors have substantially greater financial  technical and marketing resources  a larger customer base  better name recognition  and 
index more expansive product offerings 
these competitors are likely to command a larger market share than us  which may enable them to establish a stronger competitive position  in part  through greater marketing opportunities 
further  our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in user preferences and to devote greater resources to developing and operating networks of affinity websites 
these competitors may develop products or services that are comparable or superior 
if we fail to address competitive developments quickly and effectively  we may not be able to remain a viable entity 
if we are not able to adequately protect our patented rights  our operations would be negatively impacted 
our ability to compete largely depends on the superiority  uniqueness and value of our technology and intellectual property 
to protect our intellectual property rights  we rely on a combination of patent  trademark  copyright and trade secret laws  confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties  and protective contractual provisions 
further  we can give no assurances that infringement or invalidity claims or claims for indemnification resulting from infringement claims will not be asserted or prosecuted against us or that any such assertions or prosecutions will not materially adversely affect our business 
regardless of whether these or any future claims are valid or can be successfully asserted  defending against such claims could cause us to incur significant costs  could jeopardize or substantially delay a successful outcome in any future litigation  and could divert resources away from our other activities 
in addition  assertion of infringement claims could result in injunctions that prevent us from distributing our products 
in addition to challenges against our existing patents  any of the following could also reduce the value of our intellectual property now  or in the future our applications for patents  trademarks and copyrights relating to our business may not be granted and  if granted  may be challenged or invalidated  issued trademarks  copyrights  or patents may not provide us with any competitive advantages  our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights may not be effective in preventing misappropriation of our technology  or our efforts may not prevent the development and design by others of products or technologies similar to or competitive with  or superior to those we develop 
in addition  we may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights in certain foreign countries where we may do business in the future or from which competitors may operate 
while we have numerous pending foreign patents  obtaining such patents will not necessarily protect our technology or prevent our international competitors from developing similar products or technologies 
our inability to adequately protect our patented rights would have a negative impact on our operations and revenues 
in addition  legal standards relating to the validity  enforceability  and scope of protection of intellectual property rights in internet related businesses are uncertain and still evolving 
because of the growth of the internet and internet related businesses  patent applications are continuously and simultaneously being filed in connection with internet related technology 
there are a significant number of us and foreign patents and patent applications in our areas of interest  and we believe that there has been  and is likely to continue to be  significant litigation in the industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
the burdens of being a public company may adversely affect our ability to pursue litigation 
as a public company  our management must devote substantial time  attention and financial resources to comply with us securities laws 
this may have a material adverse effect on management s ability to effectively and efficiently pursue litigation as well as our other business initiatives 
in addition  our disclosure obligations under us securities laws require us to disclose information publicly that will be available to future litigation opponents 
we may  from time to time  be required to disclose information that will have a material adverse affect on our litigation strategies 
this information may enable our litigation opponents to develop effective litigation strategies that are contrary to our interests 

index when we attempt to implement our secure domain name registry services business  we may be subject to government and industry regulation and oversight which may impede our ability to achieve our business strategy 
the us government has historically controlled the authoritative domain name system  or dns  root server since the inception of the internet 
on july   the president of the united states directed the us secretary of commerce to privatize the management of the domain name system in a manner that increases competition and facilitates international participation in its management 
on september   the us department of commerce extended its delegation of authority by entering into a new agreement with the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers  or icann  a california non profit corporation headquartered in marina del rey  california 
icann is responsible for managing the accreditation of registry providers and registrars that manage the assignment of top level domain names associated with the authoritative dns root directory 
although other dns root directories are possible to create and manage privately without accreditation from icann  the possibility of conflicting name and number assignments makes it less likely that users would widely adopt a top level domain name associated with an alternative dns root directory provided by a non icann accredited registry service 
we are currently evaluating whether we will apply to become an icann accredited registry provider with respect to one or more customized gtlds  or create our own alternative dns root directory to manage the assignment of non standard secure domain names 
we have not yet begun discussions with icann and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in obtaining icann accreditation for our registry service on terms acceptable to us or at all 
whether or not we obtain accreditation from icann  we will be subject to the ongoing risks arising out of the delegation of the us government s responsibilities for the domain name system to the us department of commerce and icann and the evolving government regulatory environment with respect to domain name registry services 

index the laws governing online secure communications are largely unsettled  and if we become subject to various government regulations  costs associated with those regulations may materially adversely affect our business 
the current regulatory environment for our services remains unclear 
we can give no assurance that our planned product offerings will be in compliance with local  state and or us federal laws or other laws 
further  we can give no assurance that we will not unintentionally violate such laws or that such laws will not be modified  or that new laws will be enacted in the future which would cause us to be in violation of such laws 
voip services are not currently subject to all of the same regulations that apply to traditional telephony 
the us federal communications commission has imposed some traditional telephony requirements on voip such as disability access requirements and other obligations 
it is possible that federal and state legislatures may seek to impose increased fees and administrative burdens on voip  data and video providers 
such regulations could result in substantial costs depending on the technical changes required to accommodate the requirements  and any increased costs could erode the pricing advantage over competing forms of communication and adversely affect consumer adoption of voip products generally 
the use of the internet and private ip networks to provide voice  video and other forms of real time  two way communications services is a relatively recent development 
although the provisioning of such services is currently permitted by us law and is largely unregulated within the united states  several foreign governments have adopted laws and or regulations that could restrict or prohibit the provisioning of voice communications services over the internet or private ip networks 
more aggressive domestic or international regulation of the internet in general  and internet telephony providers and services specifically  may materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results and future prospects  particularly if increased numbers of governments impose regulations restricting the u se and sale of ip telephony services 
in addition to regulations addressing internet telephony and broadband services  other regulatory issues relating to the internet in general could affect our ability to provide our planned security solutions 
congress has adopted legislation that regulates certain aspects of the internet  including online content  user privacy  taxation  liability for third party activities and jurisdiction 
in addition  a number of initiatives pending in congress and state legislatures would prohibit or restrict advertising or sale of certain products and services on the internet  which may have the effect of raising the cost of doing business on the internet generally 
if we experience security breaches  we could be exposed to liability and our reputation and business could suffer 
we will retain certain confidential customer information in our secure data centers and secure domain name registry 
it will be critical to our business strategy that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and are perceived by the marketplace to be secure 
our secure domain name registry operations will also depend on our ability to maintain our computer and telecommunications equipment in effective working order and to reasonably protect our systems against interruption  and potentially depend on protection by other registrars in the shared registration system 
the secure domain name servers that we will operate will be critical hardware to our registry services operations 
therefore  we expect to have to expend significant time and money to maintain or increase the security of our fa cilities and infrastructure 
security technologies are constantly being tested by computer professionals  academics and hackers 
advances in the techniques for attacking security solutions could make some or all of our products obsolete or unmarketable 
likewise  if any of our products are found to have significant security vulnerabilities  then we may need to dedicate engineering and other resources to eliminate the vulnerabilities and to repair or replace products already sold or licensed to our customers 
despite our security measures  our infrastructure may be vulnerable to physical break ins  computer viruses  attacks by hackers or similar disruptive problems 
it is possible that we may have to expend additional financial and other resources to address such problems 
any physical or electronic break in o r other security breach or compromise of the information stored at our secure data centers and domain name registration systems may jeopardize the security of information stored on our premises or in the computer systems and networks of our customers 
in such an event  we could face significant liability and customers could be reluctant to use our services 
such an occurrence could also result in adverse publicity and therefore adversely affect the market s perception of the security of electronic commerce and communications over ip networks as well as of the security or reliability of our services 

index our business greatly depends on the growth of im  voip  mobile services  streaming video  file transfer and remote desktop and other next generation internet based applications 
next generation internet based applications such as instant messaging  or im  voice over internet protocol  or voip  mobile services  streaming video  file transfer and remote desktop may not continue to gain widespread market acceptance 
the internet may ultimately prove not to be a viable commercial marketplace for such applications for a number of reasons  including unwillingness of consumers to shift to voip and use other such next generation internet based applications  refusal to purchase security products to secure information transmitted through such applications  perception by the licensees of unsecure communication and data transfer  lack of concern for privacy by licensees and users  limitations on access and ease of use  congestion leading to delayed or extended response times  inadequate development of internet infrastructure to keep pace with increased levels of use  and increased government regulations 
if the market for im  voip  mobile services  streaming video  file transfer and remote desktop does not grow as anticipated  our business would be adversely affected 
the success of our products that secure im  voip  mobile services  streaming video  file transfer and remote desktop  among other real time communications applications  depends on the growth in the number of users  which in turn depends on the internet gaining more widespread acceptance as the basis for these real time communications applications 
these real time communications applications are still in early stages of market acceptance and we cannot assure you that they will continue to develop a broader audience 
for example  potential new users may view voip as unattractive relative to traditional telephone services for a number of reasons  including the need to purchase computer headsets or the perception that the price advantage for voip is insufficient to justify the perceived inconvenience 
while the use of im and other next generation internet based applications has grown rapidly in personal and professional use  there can be no assurance that users will pay to secure their use of such applications 
many services such as microsoft  yahoo and america online offer im free of charge 
however  security solutions for these services are not free  and oems may not want to adopt such security solutions if users of im do not see the value and do not want to pay for such security solutions 
if personal and professional users of im and other next generation internet based solutions do not want to pay for the security solutions  we will have difficulty marketing and selling our products and technologies 

index we expect that we will experience long and unpredictable sales cycles  which may impact our operating results 
we expect that our sales cycles will be long and unpredictable due to a number of uncertainties such as the need to educate potential customers about our patent rights and our product and service capabilities  customers willingness to invest potentially substantial resources and modify their network infrastructures to take advantage of our products  customers budgetary constraints  the timing of customers budget cycles  and delays caused by customers internal review processes 
we expect that we will be substantially dependent on a concentrated number of customers 
if we are unable to establish  maintain or replace our relationships with customers and develop a diversified customer base  our revenues may fluctuate and our growth may be limited 
we expect that in the future  a significant portion of our revenues will be generated from a limited number of customers 
substantially all of our income during fiscal year was from the payments to us resulting from the settlement and license agreement we entered into with microsoft 
there can be no guarantee that we will be able to obtain additional customers  or if we do so  to sustain our revenue levels from these prospective customers 
if we are not able to establish  maintain or replace the limited group of prospective customers that we anticipate may generate a substantial majority of our revenues in the future  or if they do not generate revenues at the levels or at the times that we anticipate  our ability to maintain or grow our revenues will be adversely affected 
if we do not successfully develop our planned products and services in a cost effective manner to customer demand in the rapidly evolving market for internet and ip based communications services  our business may fail 
the market for communications services is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  changes in customer needs and frequent new service and product introductions 
we are currently focused on developing products to provide security solutions for real time communications 
our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to use new technologies effectively  to continue to develop our technical expertise  to enhance our existing services and to develop new services that meet changing customer needs on a timely and cost effective basis 
we may not be able to adapt quickly enough to changing technology  customer requirements and industry standards 
if we fail to use new technologies effectively  to develop our technical expertise and new services  or to enhance existing services on a timely basis  either internally or through arrangements with third parties  our product and service offerings may fail to meet customer needs  which would adversely affect our revenues and prospects for growth 
in addition  if we are unable  for technological  legal  financial or other reasons  to adapt in a timely manner to changing market conditions or customer requirements  we could lose customers  strategic alliances and market share 
sudden changes in user and customer requirements and preferences  the frequent introduction of new products and services embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards and practices could render our existing products  services and systems obsolete 
the emerging nature of products and services in the technology and communications industry and their rapid evolution will require that we continually improve the performance  features and reliability of our products and services 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to design  develop  launch and or license our planned products  services and technologies that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our prospective customers  and 
index respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a cost effective and timely basis 
the development of our planned products and services and other patented technology involves significant technological and business risks and requires substantial expenditures and lead time 
we may be unable to use new technologies effectively 
updating our technology internally and licensing new technology from third parties may also require us to incur significant additional expenditures 
if our products do not gain market acceptance  we may not be able to fund future operations 
a number of factors may affect the market acceptance of our planned products or any other products we develop or acquire  including  among others the price of our products relative to other products that seek to secure real time communication  the perception by users of the effectiveness of our products  our ability to fund our sales and marketing efforts  and the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts 
if our products do not gain market acceptance  we may not be able to fund future operations  including the development of new products and or our sales and marketing efforts for our current products  which inability would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
we may incur significant expenses and damages because of liability claims 
an actual or perceived breach of our security solutions could result in a product liability claim against us 
a substantial product liability claim against us could harm our operating results and financial condition 
in addition  any actual or perceived breach of our security solution  whether or not caused by the failure of one of our products  could hurt our reputation and cause potential customers to turn to our competitors products 
our products are highly technical and may contain undetected errors  which could cause harm to our reputation and adversely affect our business 
our products are highly technical and complex and  when deployed  may contain errors or defects 
despite testing  some errors in our products may only be discovered after a product has been installed and used by customers 
any errors or defects discovered in our products after commercial release could result in failure to achieve market acceptance  loss of revenue or delay in revenue recognition  loss of customers and increased service and warranty cost  any of which could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  we could face claims for product liability  tort or breach of warranty  including claims relating to changes to our products made by our channel partners 
the performance of our products could have unforeseen or unknown adverse effects on t he networks over which they are delivered as well as on third party applications and services that utilize our services  which could result in legal claims against us  harming our business 
furthermore  we expect to provide implementation  consulting and other technical services in connection with the implementation and ongoing maintenance of our products  which typically involves working with sophisticated software  computing and communications systems 
we expect that our contracts with customers will contain provisions relating to warranty disclaimers and liability limitations  which may not be upheld 
defending a lawsuit  regardless of its merit  is costly and may divert management s attention and adversely affect the market s perception of us and our products 
in addition  if our business liability insurance coverage proves inadequate or future coverage is unavailable on acceptable terms or at all  our business  operating results and financial condi tion could be adversely impacted 

index malfunctions of third party communications infrastructure  hardware and software expose us to a variety of risks we cannot control 
in addition  our business will also depend upon the capacity  reliability and security of the infrastructure owned by third parties that we will use to deploy our offerings 
we have no control over the operation  quality or maintenance of a significant portion of that infrastructure or whether or not those third parties will upgrade or improve their equipment 
we depend on these companies to maintain the operational integrity of our connections 
if one or more of these companies is unable or unwilling to supply or expand its levels of service to us in the future  our operations could be severely interrupted 
also  to the extent the number of users of networks utilizing our future products suddenly increases  the technology platform and secure hosting services which will be required to accommoda te a higher volume of traffic may result in slower response times or service interruptions 
system interruptions or increases in response time could result in a loss of potential or existing users and  if sustained or repeated  could reduce the appeal of the networks to users 
in addition  users depend on real time communications  outages caused by increased traffic could result in delays and system failures 
these types of occurrences could cause users to perceive that our solution does not function properly and could therefore adversely affect our ability to attract and retain licensees  strategic partners and customers 
system failure or interruption or our failure to meet increasing demands on our systems could harm our business 
the success of our license and service offerings will depend on the uninterrupted operation of various systems  secure data centers and other computer and communication networks that we establish 
to the extent the number of users of networks utilizing our future products suddenly increases  the technology platform and hosting services which will be required to accommodate a higher volume of traffic may result in slower response times  service interruptions or delays or system failures 
our systems and operations will also be vulnerable to damage or interruption from power loss  transmission cable cuts and other telecommunications failures  damage or interruption caused by fire  earthquake  and other natural disasters  computer viruses or software defects  and physical or electronic break ins  sabotage  intentional acts of vandalism  terrorist attacks and other events beyond our control 
system interruptions or failures and increases or delays in response time could result in a loss of potential or existing users and  if sustained or repeated  could reduce the appeal of the networks to users 
these types of occurrences could cause users to perceive that our solution does not function properly and could therefore adversely affect our ability to attract and retain licensees  strategic partners and customers 
any significant problem with our systems or operations could result in lost revenue  customer dissatisfaction or lawsuits against us 
a failure in the operation of our secure domain name registration system could result in the inability of one or more registrars to register and maintain secure domain names for a period of time 
a failure in the operation or update of the master directory that we plan to maintain could result in deletion or discontinuation of assigned secure domain names for a period of time 
the inability of the registrar systems we establish  including our back office billing and collections infrastructure  and telecommunications systems to meet the demands of an increasing number of secure domain name requests could result in substantial degradation in our customer support service and o ur ability to process registration requests in a timely manner 

index our ability to sell our solutions will be dependent on the quality of our technical support  and our failure to deliver high quality technical support services could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 
if we do not effectively assist our customers in deploying our products  succeed in helping our customers quickly resolve post deployment issues and provide effective ongoing support  or if potential customers perceive that we may not be able achieve to the foregoing  our ability to sell our products would be adversely affected  and our reputation with potential customers could be harmed 
in addition  as we expand our operations internationally  our technical support team will face additional challenges  including those associated with delivering support  training and documentation in languages other than english 
as a result  our failure to deliver and maintain high quality technical support services to our customers could result in customers choosing to use our competitors products instead of ours in the fu ture 
telephone carriers have petitioned governmental agencies to enforce regulatory tariffs  which  if granted  would increase the cost of online communication  and such increase in cost may impede the growth of online communication and adversely affect our business 
use of the internet has over burdened existing telecommunications infrastructures  and many high traffic areas have begun to experience interruptions in service 
as a result  certain local telephone carriers have petitioned governmental agencies to enforce regulatory tariffs on ip telephony traffic that crosses over the traditional telephone networks 
if any of these petitions or the relief that they seek is granted  the costs of communicating via online could increase substantially  potentially adversely affecting the growth in the use of online secure communications 
any of these developments could have an adverse effect on our business 
the departure of kendall larsen  our chief executive officer and president  and or other key personnel could compromise our ability to execute our strategic plan and may result in additional severance costs to us 
our success largely depends on the skills  experience and efforts of our key personnel  including kendall larsen  our chief executive officer and president 
we have no employment agreements with any of our key executives that prevent them from leaving us at any time 
in addition  we do not maintain key person life insurance for any of our officers or key employees 
the loss of mr 
larsen  or our failure to retain other key personnel  would jeopardize our ability to execute our strategic plan and materially harm our business 
we will need to recruit and retain additional qualified personnel to successfully grow our business 
our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain qualified operations  marketing and sales personnel as well as engineers 
inability to attract and retain such personnel could adversely affect our business 
competition for engineering  sales  marketing and executive personnel is intense  particularly in the technology and internet sectors and in the regions where our facilities are located 
we can provide no assurance that we will attract or retain such personnel 
growth of internal operations and business may strain our financial resources 
we may need to significantly expand the scope of our operating and financial systems in order to build our business 
our growth rate may place a significant strain on our financial resources for a number of reasons  including  but not limited to  the following the need for continued development of the financial and information management systems  the need to manage relationships with future licensees  resellers  distributors and strategic partners  
index the need to hire and retain skilled management  technical and other personnel necessary to support and manage our business  and the need to train and manage our employee base 
the addition of new infrastructure services  networks  vertical categories and affinity websites and the attention they demand  may also strain our management resources 
we cannot give you any assurance that we will adequately address these risks and  if we do not  our ability to successfully expand our business could be adversely affected 
failing to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could cause our costs to increase and could cause our stock price to decline 
on january  the audit committee of our board of directors determined that the previously filed financial statements for the fiscal quarter ended september   the fiscal year ended december   the fiscal quarter ended march   the fiscal quarter ended june  and the fiscal quarter ended september  should no longer be relied upon and needed to be restated to adjust the accounting for certain derivative instruments the series i warrants issued by the company in a private placement transaction in september 
we also determined that we did not maintain effective control over our accounting for the series i warrants and that a material weakness existed with respect to our reporting of complex  non routine transactions the series i warrants  as of the end of the periods covered by the for m k and form qs that included the financial statements referenced above and as of the end of the period covered by this form k 
although we subsequently restated all such financial statements  we do not believe that we are currently maintaining effective control over our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting as regards this issue  and we may in the future identify deficiencies regarding the design and effectiveness of our system of internal control over financial reporting that we engage in pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act  or section  as part of our periodic reporting obligations 
such deficiencies could include those arising from our lack of technical accounting expertise in the interpretation of complex  non routine transactions  which we may not be able to remediate in time to meet the continuing reporting deadlines imposed by section and the costs of which may harm our results of operations 
in addition  if we continue to fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls  as such standards are modified  supplemented or amended from time to time  we may not be able to ensure that our management can conclude in the future that we have effective internal controls 
we also may not be able to retain an independent registered public accounting firm with sufficient resources to attest to and report on our internal controls in a timely manner 
moreover  our registered public accounting firm may not agree with our management s future assessments and may deem our controls ineffective if we are unable to remediate on a timely basis 
if in the future we continue to be unable to assert that we maintain effective internal controls  our investors could lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which could cause our stock price to decline 
if we expand into international markets  our inexperience outside the united states would increase the risk that our international expansion efforts will not be successful  which would in turn limit our prospects for growth 
we may explore expanding our business to outside the united states 
expansion into international markets requires significant management attention and financial resources 
in addition  we may face the following risks associated with any expansion outside the united states challenges caused by distance  language and cultural differences  legal  legislative and regulatory restrictions  currency exchange rate fluctuations  economic instability  longer payment cycles in some countries  the company may not be able to successfully manage the rapid growth of the company s business 
the company experienced significant growth during fiscal primarily as a result of the income it recognized pursuant to the settlement and license agreement with microsoft 
this growth places additional demands on the company s managerial  administrative and operational resources 
failure to manage growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on the company s prospects and the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
we are subject to financial reporting and other requirements for which our accounting  internal audit and other management systems and resources may not be adequately prepared 
beginning with our annual report on this form k for the fiscal year ending december   we were required by sec rules to include a report of management on the company s internal control over financial reporting in our annual reports 
in addition  our independent registered public accounting firm auditing our financial statements was required to provide an attestation report on our internal control for fiscal the company was not an accelerated filer prior to fiscal and therefore was not required to have an attestation report from our independent registered public accounting firm on our internal controls 
we expect that these reporting and other obligations will increase for the company in fiscal and going forward as a result of our change in status from a smaller reporting company to an accelerated filer for the fiscal year 
we expect that these expanded reporting and other obligations  specifically the requirements as an accelerated filer  will place significant demands on our management  administrative  operational  internal audit and accounting resources and cause us to incur significant expenses 
if we are unable to accomplish these objectives in a timely and effective fashion  our ability to comply with the f inancial reporting requirements and other rules that apply to reporting companies could be impaired 

index credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud  potentially adverse tax consequences  and other higher costs associated with doing business internationally 
these risks could harm our international expansion efforts  which would in turn harm our business prospects 
our business and ability to grow are subject to risks associated with the ongoing financial crisis and weak global economy 
the continuing turmoil in the financial markets and weak global economy impacts our ability to enter into licensing and other customer agreements 
further  these conditions and uncertainty about future economic conditions make it challenging for us to forecast our operating results  make business decisions and identify the risks that may affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we are not able to timely and appropriately adapt to changes resulting from the difficult macroeconomic environment  our business  financial condition  and results of operations may be significantly negatively affected 
risks related to our stock we do not intend to pay regular future dividends on our common stock and thus stockholders must look to appreciation of our common stock to realize a gain on their investments 
although we paid a special cash dividend to holders of our common stock with a record date of july   we do not have any plans to continue paying dividends in the foreseeable future 
instead  we currently intend to retain any future earnings for funding growth 
our future dividend policy is within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon various factors  including our business  financial condition  results of operations  capital requirements  and investment opportunities 
accordingly  stockholders must look solely to appreciation of our common stock to realize a gain on their investment 
this appreciation may not occur 
the exercise of our outstanding warrants or stock options may result in a dilution of our current stockholders voting power and an increase in the number of shares eligible for future resale in the public market which may negatively impact the market price of our stock 
the exercise of some or all of our outstanding warrants could significantly dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders 
as of december   we had outstanding warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock 
to the extent outstanding warrants are exercised  additional shares of common stock will be issued  and such issuance may dilute existing stockholders and increase the number of shares eligible for resale in the public market 
additionally  the issuance of up to  shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of vested stock options and other stock awards outstanding as of december  pursuant to our stock incentive plan may further dilute our existing stockholders voting interest 
in addition to the dilutive effects described above  the exercise of those securities would lead to a potential increase in the number of shares eligible for resale in the public market 
sales of substantial numbers of such shares in the public market could adversely affect the market price of our shares 
the fair value of accounting for our series i warrants as derivative liabilities may materially impact our results of our operations in future periods 
in connection with the restatement of our financial results to correct the accounting for the series i warrants  we recorded the series i warrants as a derivative liability in accordance with asc  derivatives and hedging contracts in entity s own equity 
these derivative liabilities are reported at fair value each reporting period with changes in the fair value recognized as gain or loss during each reporting period 
an increase in our stock price or measure of our stock price volatility  for example  will generally result in an increase in the fair value of our warrant liability and a non cash charge during the period of such increase  and could materially and negatively impact our results of operations in future periods 

index trading in our common stock is limited and the price of our common stock may be subject to substantial volatility  particularly in light of the instability in the financial and capital markets 
our common stock is listed on nyse amex  but its daily trading volume has been limited  sporadic and volatile 
over the past years the market price of our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations 
between december  and december   the reported last sale price for our common stock has ranged between and per share 
the price of our common stock may continue to be volatile as a result of a number of factors  including  but not limited to  the following developments in any then outstanding litigation  quarterly variations in our operating results  large purchases or sales of common stock  actual or anticipated announcements of new products or services by us or competitors  general conditions in the markets in which we compete  and economic and financial conditions 
because ownership of our common shares is concentrated  investors may have limited influence on stockholder decisions 
as of december   our executive officers and directors beneficially owned approximately of our then outstanding common stock 
in addition  a group of stockholders that  as of december   held  shares  or approximately of our then outstanding common stock  have entered into a voting agreement with us that requires them to vote all of their shares of our voting stock in favor of the director nominees approved by our board of directors at each director election going forward  and in a manner that is proportional to the votes cast by all other voting shares as to any other matters submitted to the stockholders for a vote 
however  we cannot be certain how many shares of our common stock this group of stockholders currently owns 
because of their beneficial ownership interest  ou r officers and directors could significantly influence stockholder actions of which you disapprove or that are contrary to your interests 
this ability to exercise significant influence could prevent or significantly delay another company from acquiring or merging with us 
securities analysts may not cover our common stock and this may have a negative impact on our common stock s market price 
the trading market for our common stock may depend on the research and reports that securities analysts publish about us or our business 
we do not have any control over these analysts 
there is no guarantee that securities analysts will cover our common stock 
if securities analysts do not cover our common stock  the lack of research coverage may adversely affect our common stock s market price 
if we are covered by securities analysts  and our stock is downgraded  our stock price would likely decline 
if one or more of these analysts ceases to cover us or fails to publish regularly reports on us  we could lose or fail to gain visibility in the financial markets  which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline 

index our protective provisions could make it difficult for a third party to successfully acquire us even if you would like to sell your shares to them 
we have a number of protective provisions that could delay  discourage or prevent a third party from acquiring control of us without the approval of our board of directors 
our protective provisions include a staggered board of directors this means that only one or two directors since we have a five person board of directors will be up for election at any given annual meeting 
this has the effect of delaying the ability of stockholders to effect a change in control of us since it would take two annual meetings to effectively replace at least three directors which represents a majority of the board of directors 
blank check preferred stock our board of directors has the authority to establish the rights  preferences and privileges of our  authorized  but unissued  shares of preferred stock 
therefore  this stock may be issued at the discretion of our board of directors with preferences over your shares of our common stock in a manner that is materially dilutive to existing stockholders 
in addition  blank check preferred stock can be used to create a poison pill which is designed to deter a hostile bidder from buying a controlling interest in our stock without the approval of our board of directors 
we have not adopted such a poison pill  but our board of directors has the ability to do so in the future  very rapidly and without stockholder approval 
advance notice requirements for director nominations and for new business to be brought up at stockholder meetings stockholders wishing to submit director nominations or raise matters to a vote of the stockholders must provide notice to us within very specific date windows and in very specific form in order to have the matter voted on at a stockholder meeting 
this has the effect of giving our board of directors and management more time to react to stockholder proposals generally and could also have the effect of disregarding a stockholder proposal or deferring it to a subsequent meeting to the extent such proposal is not raised properly 
no stockholder actions by written consent no stockholder or group of stockholders may take actions rapidly and without prior notice to our board of directors and management or to the minority stockholders 
along with the advance notice requirements described above  this provision also gives our board of directors and management more time to react to proposed stockholder actions

elimination of the ability of stockholders to call a special meeting of the stockholders only the board of directors or management can call special meetings of the stockholders

securities authorized for issuance under equity compensation plans on april   when we operated under the name pasw  inc  we adopted an equity incentive program 
under this program  we may grant incentive stock options  non statutory stock options  stock appreciation rights  stock bonuses and rights to acquire restricted stock to employees  directors and consultants except for incentive stock options which may only be granted to employees

we filed a registration statement on form s file no 
to cover the common stock issued and the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants 
the series i warrants are rights to purchase an aggregate of approximately  shares of the company s common stock over a year term at an exercise price equal to of the price per share paid in the private placement ie  per share  subject to antidilution protection that could reduce the exercise price to of the closing price on september  ie  per share if the company completes other financings while the series i warrants are outstanding at a price per share less than the exercise price per share of the series i warrants 
the series i warrants were not exercisable until six months following the closing of the private placement and expire on fifth anniversary of the closing of the private placement 
aside from the antidilution adjustment associated with the exercise p rice premium  the series i warrants are not subject to any further adjustments with respect to the exercise price or number of shares covered 
in connection with the september private placement  we issued one of the series i warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock with an exercise price of per share to the placement agent in the private placement 
the warrant issued to the placement agent in september will expire years after issuance 

index the series ii warrants provided the investors pricing protection for the private placement with a floor price of per share 
in the event the market price of our common stock declined between the closing of the private placement and the earlier of i the date the registration statement was declared effective and ii the date rule became available for resale of the shares ie  generally months after the closing of the private placement such date that is the earlier of clause i and ii above is referred to in this registration statement as the warrant exercise date  the series ii warrants would be automatically exercised on a cashless exercise basis and a number of additional shares would be issued to the investors who participated in the private placement in order to effectively reduce the per share purchase price paid in the private placement to the greater of i of the day volume weighted average trading price per share of the company s common stock immediately following the warrant exercise date and ii per share 
as such  the greatest number of shares that could be issued pursuant to the series ii warrants was approximately  shares 
at the warrant exercise date  the series ii warrants would either be automatically exercised on a cashless exercise basis if the company s stock price was lower at the warrant exercise date as described above  or they would expire unexercised 
the adjustment associated with the series ii warrants did not affect either the exercise price or number of shares covered by either the series i warrants or the series iii warrants

index to date  our primary source of significant income has been from the settlement and license agreement we entered into with microsoft corporation  our first licensee  on may   or the settlement and license agreement 
pursuant to the settlement and license agreement  microsoft paid us  in june and we dismissed the two patent infringement lawsuits we initiated against microsoft in february and march and granted microsoft a worldwide  irrevocable  nonexclusive  non sub licensable fully paid up license under our patents 
we are currently involved in litigation against aastra  apple  cisco  nec  siemens and mitel with respect to our allegations that these companies infringes on certain of our patents and are seeking both damages and injunctive relief 
we expect to use a signifi cant portion of the proceeds we received from the settlement and license agreement to fund the costs and expenses of these litigation matters and if we are not successful  we may substantially deplete our capital resources and our ability to fund future operations 
although we believe these potential claims are worth pursuing  commencing a lawsuit can be expensive and time consuming  and there is no assurance that we will prevail on such potential claims 
in addition  bringing a lawsuit may lead to potential counterclaims which may preclude our ability to commercialize our initial products  which are currently in development 
we also believe that we may derive revenues in the future from licensing our software and technology solutions and we are currently endeavoring to develop certain marketable products 
we expect to continue to incur significant expenses  including but not limited to those we expect to incur in our patent infringement litigation matters against aastra  apple  cisco  nec  siemens and mitel  and we do not currently have any sources of revenue from our continuing operations 
if we are unsuccessful in these matters or in developing certain marketable products  we may be unable to successfully complete our business plans  our business may fail and you could lose some or all of your investment in our securities 
we are subject to numerous risks including the uncertainty that our technology licensing program development efforts will produce revenue bearing licenses for us  the uncertainty that our development initiatives will produce successful commercial products as well as the marketing and customer acceptance of such products  competition from larger  better funded organizations  dependence on key personnel  uncertain patent protection  and dependence on corporate partners and collaborators

index on january   the audit committee determined that the previously filed financial statements for the following periods should no longer be relied upon the fiscal quarter ended september  included in its quarterly report on form q as filed with the securities and exchange commission sec on november  the form q  the fiscal year ended december  included in its annual report on form k as filed with the sec on march  the form k along with the related audit report from its independent registered public accounting firm  the fiscal quarter ended march  included in its quarterly report on form q as filed with the sec on may  the q form q  the fiscal quarter ended june  included in its quarterly report on form q as filed with the sec on august  the q form q  and the fiscal quarter ended september  included in its quarterly report on form q as filed with the sec on november  the q form q and  collectively with the form q  the q form q and the q form q  the form qs 
virnetx restated the form k and form qs  which were filed with the securities and exchange commission on january   to adjust the accounting for certain derivative instruments the series i warrants issued by the company in a private placement transaction in september in such financial statements  which were previously recorded as equity instruments the restatements 
in connection with the restatements  we performed a re assessment of the series i warrants to purchase  shares of common stock that were issued in connection with its september private placement and has concluded that the series i warrants are liabilities within the scope of accounting standards codification topic  derivatives and hedging contracts in entity s own equity asc  because the series i warrants contain a provision requiring a weighted average adjustment to the exercise price of the series i warrants in the event the company issues common stock  or securities convertible into or exercisable for common stock  at a price per share lower than such exercise price 
accordingly  the series i warr ants should have been accounted for as a derivative liability  measured at fair value  with changes in fair value recognized as gain or loss for each reporting period thereafter 
the restatement did not impact the company previously reported cash  cash equivalents  short term investments or cash flows 
in connection with the restatements  the company s chief executive officer and chief financial officer re evaluated  with the participation of management  the effectiveness of the company s disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting  and concluded that the company did not maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls over financial reporting for the reasons discussed in part ii  item a disclosure controls and procedures of this form k 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
the critical accounting policies we employ in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are those which involve impairment of long lived assets  income taxes  fair value of financial instruments and stock based compensation 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  we have delivered the product or performed the service  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
if any of these criteria are not met  we defer recognizing the revenue until such time as all criteria are met 
depending on the complexity of the underlying revenue arrangement and related terms and conditions  significant judgments  assumptions and estimates may be required to determine when substantial delivery of contract elements will occur  whether any significant ongoing obligations exist subsequent to contract execution  whether amounts due are collectible and the appropriate period or periods in which  or during which  the completion of the earning process occurs 
depending on the magnitude of specific revenue arrangements  if different judgments  assumptions and estimates are made regarding contracts executed in any specific period  our periodic financial results may be materially affected 

index impairment of long lived assets we identify and record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events and changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset might not be recoverable  but not less than annually 
recoverability is measured by comparison of the anticipated future net undiscounted cash flows to the related assets carrying value 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the projected discounted future net cash flows arising from the asset 
income taxes income tax expense is computed using an asset and liability method and using expected annual effective tax rates 
under this method  deferred income tax assets and liabilities result from temporary differences in the financial reporting bases and the income tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities 
the measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced  if necessary  by the amount of any tax benefit that  based on available evidence  is not expected to be realized 
when it appears more likely than not that deferred taxes will not be realized  a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax asset to its estimated realizable value 
for net deferred tax assets we consider estimates of future taxable income  including tax planning strategies in determining whether our net deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized 
effective january   we have adopted  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes using the prospective method 
the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
implementation of fasb asc derivatives and hedging contracts in entity own equity scope and scope exceptions in june  the fasb ratified guidance included in asc derivatives and hedging contracts in entity own equity scope and scope exceptions  which provides that an entity should use a two step approach to evaluate whether an equity linked financial instrument or embedded feature is indexed to its own stock  including evaluating the instrument contingent exercise and settlement provisions 
asc contains provisions describing conditions when an instrument or embedded feature would be considered indexed to an entity own stock for purposes of evaluating the instrument or embedded feature under fasb asc topic derivatives and hedging  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts 
under the provisions of asc the embedded series i warrants are not considered indexed to our stock 
as a result of the antidilution protection in the series i warrants and the application of asc  effective september   the warrants were required to be accounted for as derivative instruments 
accordingly  effective september  company series i warrant conversion feature and investor warrants are recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
stock based compensation we account for share based compensation in accordance with the fair value method  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense in the statement of operations for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors including employee stock options based on estimated fair values 
using the modified retrospective transition method of adopting this standard  the financial statements presented herein reflect compensation expense for stock based awards as if the provisions of this standard had been applied from the date of our inception 
in addition  we record stock and options granted to non employees at fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity investments issued as they vest over the performance period 
new accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb established a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap and expanded disclosure about fair value measurements including valuing securities in markets that are not active 
the company adopted the framework for measuring fair value effective january  with the exception of the application of the framework to non recurring  non financial assets and non financial liabilities 
the adoption of the framework for measuring fair value did not have a significant impact on the company s results of operations or financial position 
in june  the fasb issued guidance requiring that unvested instruments granted in share based payment transactions that contain non forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are participating securities subject to the two class method of computing earnings per share 
this guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  the adoption did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb required disclosures about fair value of financial instruments for interim reporting periods of publicly traded companies as well as in annual financial statements  effective for interim reporting periods ending after june   and required those disclosures in summarized financial information at interim reporting periods 
the company adopted the new disclosure guidance over fair value of financial instruments  and adoption did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 

index in june  the fasb established the accounting standards codification codification as the single source of authoritative gaap to be applied by nongovernmental entities  except for the rules and interpretive releases of the securities and exchange commission sec under authority of federal securities laws  which are sources of authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
while not intended to change gaap  the codification significantly changes the way in which the accounting literature is referenced and organized 
the codification was adopted as of august  adoption did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb required new disclosures about fair value of financial instruments for interim and annual reporting periods 
these new disclosures were effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for disclosures about purchases  sales  issuance and settlement of level financial instruments  which are effective for interim and annual reporting periods in fiscal years beginning after december  adoption is not expected to have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
operations revenue royalties revenue generated for the twelve months ended december  was  compared to  for the twelve months ended december  our revenue was solely limited to the royalties earned under our single license agreement through our japanese subsidiary 
we expect the revenue from this license to decrease substantially in the future 
we do not intend to seek additional licenses or other revenue through our japanese subsidiary 
gain on settlement in may  we entered into a settlement and license agreement with microsoft 
pursuant to the settlement and license agreement  microsoft paid us  in june and we dismissed the two patent infringement lawsuits we initiated against microsoft in february and march and granted microsoft a worldwide  irrevocable  nonexclusive  non sub licensable fully paid up license under our patents 
we recorded the  lump sum payment as gain on settlement as a result of litigation 
we originally classified this payment as revenue 
upon further analysis  the company could not practically and objectively separate any settlement portion from the revenue element as discussed under the guidance of asc topic as a result  the company now classifies the amount as a gain on settlement 
this settlement satisfies all past litigation and disputes between the company and microsoft and there are no future obligations that the company would need to perform to earn this settlement payment 
that is  the license and settlement agreement represents fully paid up licenses by both the company and microsoft for which no future payment or delivery is required 
accordingly  the company recognized the entire s ettlement amount in its operating results 
research and development expenses research and development costs include expenses paid to outside development consultants and compensation related expenses for our engineering staff 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
our research and development expenses increased from  for the twelve months ended december  to  for the twelve months ended december  this increase is primarily due to increased costs related to engineering activities for product development  salary increases for all of our employees and the bonuses that were paid to our employees in 
index selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses include management and administrative personnel  as well as outside legal  accounting  and consulting services 
our selling  general and administrative expenses increased by  to  for from  for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to increased legal fees  approximately  for the contingent fees on the microsoft settlement and an increase of  in other legal fees in over a bonus of approximately  was paid to the employees and directors after the license agreement was signed account for most of the rest of the increased expenses 
legal fees represent approximately of general and administrative expenses for compared to in royalty expense was  for  compared to no royalty expenses in  all due to the amounts paid to saic in royalty payments following the execution of the settlement and license agreement was signed with microsoft 
the royalty expense has hit its maximum under the settlement and license agreement and will be paid in future periods only in certain circumstances 
other income expenses the company recognized  in non cash loss related to the periodic revaluation of its series i warrants in fiscal this loss is a result of the company s stock price increasing and making the outstanding warrants more valuable 
there were no derivative instruments in the prior year 
we recognized  in interest in compared to  in liquidity and capital resources as of december   our cash and cash equivalents totaled  and our short term investments totaled  compared to  and zero  respectively  as of december  the increase in our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments for the fiscal year ended december  over the fiscal year ended december  is primarily due to the cash we received from the payments under the settlement and license agreement with microsoft discussed below and our investments of such amounts 
we recognized an unrealized loss on our investments of  for the fiscal year ended december  compared to no gain or loss on our investments for the fiscal year ended december  because we did not have any investments available for sale as of december  we have determined that this loss is temporary because the fair value of our investment securities is below the carrying value primarily due to changes in interest rates and we anticipate that this loss will be reversed over the securities remaining lives  as demonstrated by improved valuations in fiscal before entering into the microsoft settlement  we allocated a large part of our cash and cash equivalents to the fees and expenses associated with the microsoft litigation 
we expect that our cash and cash equivalents as of december  to be sufficient to fund our operations and provide working capital for general corporate purposes and legal expenses  including the expenses for the new complaints against aastra usa  inc  aastra technologies ltd  apple inc  cisco systems  inc  nec corporation  nec corporation of america  siemens and mitel for at least the next months 
other than the anticipated expenses associated with the new complaints  the company does not currently have any material commitments for capital expenditures 
while we do not expect a significant increase in income in the near term similar to that associated with the gain on settlement recognized during the twelve months ended december  as a result of the settlement and license agreement  we do expect to derive the majority of our future income from license fees and royalties associated with our technology  software and secure domain name registry in the united states and other markets around the world over the long term 
investors should not expect the company to receive settlements income for the new complaints unless and until the new complaints are resolved in the company s favor and there is no assurance that the company will prevail on such potential claims 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a of regulation s k 

index item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk due to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the increase or decrease in the value of the  investments available for sale in our investment portfolio 
our risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investments in interest rate sensitive financial instruments 
under our current investment policy  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
we attempt to increase the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting the percentage of funds invested in any one instrument and investing in short term debt securities that generally have a maturity of less than six months 
we mitigate default risk by investing primarily in investment grade securities 
a basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments 
changes in interest rates over time will increase or decrease our interest income
