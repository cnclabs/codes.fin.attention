the statements in this discussion regarding our expectations of our future performance  liquidity and capital resources  and other non historical statements are forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  the risks and uncertainties described under risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward looking statements 
overview we are a leading provider of data and information management software applications and related services in terms of product breadth and functionality and market penetration 
we develop  market and sell a unified suite of data and information management software applications under the simpana brand 
our simpana software is a platform with licensable modules that work together seamlessly  sharing a single code and common function set  to deliver backup and recovery  archive  replication  search and resource management capabilities 
with a single platform approach  simpana is specifically designed to protect  manage and access data throughout its lifecycle in less time  at lower cost and with fewer resources than alternative solutions 
our products and capabilities enable our customers to deploy solutions for data protection  business continuance  corporate compliance and centralized management and reporting 
we also provide our customers with a broad range of highly effective services that are delivered by our worldwide support and field operations 
as of march   we had licensed our software applications to approximately  registered customers 
history and background in early  we launched commvault galaxy for backup and recovery  a storage industry award winner 
in the years since  commvault has forged numerous alliances with top software application and hardware vendors  such as dell  hp  hitachi data systems  microsoft  network appliance  novell and oracle  to enhance capabilities and to create a premiere suite of data and information management solutions 
in  we launched our single platform technology that provides the foundation of our information management approach to storing  managing  and accessing data 
our simpana software suite is comprised of the following five distinct data and information management software application modules data protection back up and recovery  archive  replication  resource management and search 
all of our software application modules share a common platform that provides back end services and advanced capabilities  like encryption  deduplication  content indexing  policy based automation  data classification  e discovery and role based security 
in addition to back up and recovery  the subsequent release of our other software application modules has substantially increased our addressable market 
each application module can be used individually or in combination with other application modules from our single platform suite 
in july  we released our commvault simpana software suite simpana  which significantly expanded the breadth and depth of our existing data and information management suite at that time 
we believe that simpana provided us the foundation to shift to providing information management solutions 
simpana provided major enhancements to our existing backup  archiving and replication products and also delivered new product features that are non backup related including single instancing  advanced archiving  enterprise wide search and discovery and data classification 
in january  commvault simpana simpana was made available for public release 
simpana included advances in recovery management  data reduction  virtual server protection and content organization 
in addition  we believe that simpana met a broad spectrum of customer s discovery and recovery management requirements and eliminated the need for a myriad of point level products 
in august  our commvault simpana software suite simpana was made available for public release 
we believe that simpana  which builds on and significantly expands simpana  allows customers to deploy a modern data management solution to achieve gains in efficiency  cost optimization and scale 
we believe that simpana solves real world it challenges with major technology advancements  including increased virtualization scalability and performance  integrated source and target data deduplication  automatic and transparent integration with hardware array based snapshots  as well as new tools that ease migration to our next generation simpana platform 

table of contents we currently derive the majority of our software revenue from our backup and recovery software application 
sales of backup and recovery represented approximately of our total software revenue for fiscal and of our total software revenue for fiscal in addition  we derive the majority of our services revenue from customer and technical support associated with our backup and recovery software application 
the increase in software revenue generated by our non backup and recovery software products  or advanced data and information management products adim  was primarily driven by new components and enhancements related to simpana and simpana software suites 
we anticipate that adim software revenue will continue to increase in the future as we expand our domestic and international sales activities and continue to build brand awareness 
however  we anticipate that we will continue to derive a majority of our software and services revenue from our backup and recovery software application for the next few fiscal years 
more recently  the industry in which we currently operate is going through accelerating changes as the result of the introduction of new technologies such as cloud computing 
we believe cloud computing  in its various forms  represents a major new long term trend in the way that applications are delivered  data is stored and information is retrieved 
we believe as a result of our simpana data and information management platform  that we are in a unique position to enhance and extend the value of our simpana software suite by developing innovative  industry leading ways to manage data and information in the cloud 
in addition to extending the simpana platform into the cloud  we are continuing to pursue an aggressive product development program in both data and information management solutions 
our data management solutions include not only traditional backup and recovery  but also new innovations in de duplication  data movement  virtualization  snap based backups and enterprise reporting 
our information management innovations are primarily in the areas of archiving  ediscovery  records management  governance and compliance 
we remain focused on both the data and information management trends in the marketplace and  in fact  a material portion of our existing research and development expenses are utilized toward the development of such new technologies discussed above 
while we are confident in our ability to meet these changing industry demands with simpana and simpana and potential future releases  the development  release and timing of any features or functionality remain at our sole discretion and our solutions to cloud computing or other technologies may not be widely adopted 
given the nature of the industry in which we operate  our software applications are subject to obsolescence 
as noted above  we continually develop and introduce updates to our existing software applications in order to keep pace with evolving industry technologies such as cloud computing 
in addition  we must address evolving industry standards  changing customer requirements and competitive software applications that may render our existing software applications obsolete 
for each of our software applications  we provide full support for the current generally available release and one prior release 
when we declare a product release obsolete  a customer notice is delivered twelve months prior to the effective date of obsolescence announcing continuation of full product support for the first six months 
we provide an additional six months of extended assistance support in which we only provide existing workarounds or fixes that do not require additional development activity 
we do not have existing plans to make any of our software products permanently obsolete 
sources of revenues we derive a significant portion of our total revenues from sales of licenses of our software applications 
we do not customize our software for a specific end user customer 
we sell our software applications to end user customers both directly through our sales force and indirectly through our global network of value added reseller partners  systems integrators  corporate resellers and original equipment manufacturers 
our software revenue was of our total revenues for fiscal  for fiscal and for fiscal in recent fiscal years  we have generated approximately two thirds of our software revenue from our existing customer base and approximately one third of our software revenue from new customers 
in addition  our total software revenue in any particular period is  to a certain extent  dependent upon our ability to generate revenues from large customer software deals  which we refer to as enterprise software transactions 
we expect the number of enterprise software transactions transactions greater than million and resulting software revenue to increase throughout fiscal  although the size and timing of any particular software transaction is more difficult to forecast 
such software transactions represented approximately of our total software revenue in fiscal  approximately of our software revenue in fiscal and approximately of our software revenue in fiscal 
table of contents software revenue generated through indirect distribution channels was approximately of total software revenue in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal software revenue generated through direct distribution channels was approximately of total software revenue in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the dollar value of software revenue generated through indirect distribution channels increased approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal the dollar value of software revenue generated through direct distribution channels increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in the dollar value of software revenue growth generated through our indirect distribution channels compared to our direct sales force in fiscal is primarily the result of an increase in software revenue from our international operations  which is almost exclusively transacted through indirect distribution 
deals initiated by our direct sales force are sometimes transacted through indirect channels based on end user customer requirements  which are not always in our control and can cause this overall percentage split to vary from year to year 
as such  there may be fluctuations in the dollars and percentage of software revenue generated through our direct distribution channels from time to time 
we believe that the growth of our software revenue  derived from both our indirect channel partners and direct sales force  are key attributes to our long term growth strategy 
we will continue to invest in both our channel relationships and direct sales force in the future  but we continue to expect more revenue to be generated through indirect distribution channels over the long term 
the failure of our indirect distribution channels or our direct sales force to effectively sell our software applications could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 
we have a worldwide reseller and an original equipment agreement with dell 
our reseller agreement with dell provides them the right to market  resell and distribute certain of our products to their customers 
our original equipment manufacturer agreement with dell is discussed more fully below 
sales through our agreements with dell accounted for of our total revenues for fiscal  of our total revenues for fiscal and of our total revenues in fiscal we have original equipment manufacturer agreements primarily with dell and hitachi data systems for them to market  sell and support our software applications and services on a stand alone basis and or incorporate our software applications into their own hardware products 
dell and hitachi data systems have no obligation to recommend or offer our software applications exclusively or at all  and they have no minimum sales requirements and can terminate our relationship at any time 
a material portion of our software revenue is generated through these arrangements  and we expect this contribution to grow in the future 
sales through our original equipment manufacturer agreements accounted for of our total revenues for fiscal  of our total revenues for fiscal and of our total revenues for fiscal we also have non exclusive distribution agreements covering our north american commercial markets and our us federal government market with arrow enterprise computing solutions  inc arrow  a subsidiary of arrow electronics  inc  and avnet technology solutions avnet  a subsidiary of avnet  inc pursuant to these distribution agreements  these distributors primary role is to enable a more efficient and effective distribution channel for our products and services by managing our reseller partners and leveraging their own industry experience 
many of our north american resellers have been transitioned to either arrow or avnet 
we generated approximately of our total revenues through arrow in fiscal  approximately of our total revenues in fiscal and approximately of our total revenues in fiscal avnet s total revenue contribution was not material in fiscal  or if arrow or avnet were to discontinue or reduce the sales of our products or if our agreement with arrow or avnet was terminated  and if we were unable to take back the management of our reseller channel or find another north american distributor to replace arrow or avnet  then it could have a material adverse effect on our future revenues 
our services revenue is made up of fees from the delivery of customer support and other professional services  which are typically sold in connection with the sale of our software applications 
customer support agreements provide technical support and unspecified software updates on a when and if available basis for an annual fee based on licenses purchased and the level of service subscribed 
other professional services include consulting  assessment and design services  implementation and post deployment services and training  all of which to date have predominantly been sold in connection with the sale of software applications 
our services revenue was of our total revenues for fiscal  for fiscal and for fiscal the gross margin of our services revenue was for fiscal  for fiscal and for fiscal the increase in the gross margin of our services revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to a higher percentage of our services revenue being derived from customer support agreements as a result of sales to new customers and renewal agreements with our installed customer base 
overall  our services revenue has lower gross margins than our software revenue 
the gross margin of our software revenue was for fiscal  for fiscal and for fiscal an increase in the percentage of total revenues represented by services revenue may adversely affect our overall gross margins 

table of contents description of costs and expenses our cost of revenues is as follows cost of software revenue  consists primarily of third party royalties and other costs such as media  manuals  translation and distribution costs  and cost of services revenue  consists primarily of salary and employee benefit costs in providing customer support and other professional services 
our operating expenses are as follows sales and marketing  consists primarily of salaries  commissions  employee benefits  stock based compensation and other direct and indirect business expenses  including travel and related expenses  sales promotion expenses  public relations expenses and costs for marketing materials and other marketing events such as trade shows and advertising  research and development  which is primarily the expense of developing new software applications and modifying existing software applications  consists principally of salaries  stock based compensation and benefits for research and development personnel and related expenses  contract labor expense and consulting fees as well as other expenses associated with the design  certification and testing of our software applications  and legal costs associated with the patent registration of such software applications  general and administrative  consists primarily of salaries  stock based compensation and benefits for our executive  accounting  human resources  legal  information systems and other administrative personnel 
also included in this category are other general corporate expenses  such as outside legal and accounting services  compliance costs and insurance  and depreciation and amortization  consists of depreciation expense primarily for computer equipment we use for information services and in our development and test labs 
we anticipate that each of the above categories of operating expenses will increase in dollar amounts  but will decline as a percentage of total revenues in the long term 
foreign currency exchange rates impact on results of operations sales outside the united states were approximately of our total revenue for fiscal  for fiscal and for fiscal the income statements of our non us operations are translated into us dollars at the average exchange rates for each applicable month in a period 
to the extent the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies  the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions generally results in increased revenue  operating expenses and income from operations for our non us operations 
similarly  our revenue  operating expenses and net income will generally decrease for our non us operations if the non us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies 
using the average foreign currency exchange rates from the corresponding fiscal period  our total revenues  cost of revenues and operating expenses from non us operations for fiscal would have been lower by approximately million  million and million  respectively 
using the average foreign currency exchange rates from the corresponding fiscal period  our total revenues from non us operations for fiscal would have been lower by approximately million  and our cost of revenues and operating expenses from non us operations would have been higher by less than million and higher by approximately million  respectively 
in addition  we are exposed to risks of foreign currency fluctuation primarily from cash balances  accounts receivables and intercompany accounts denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to the resulting transaction gains and losses  which are recorded as a component of general and administrative expenses 
we recognized net foreign currency transaction losses of million in fiscal  net foreign currency transaction losses of million in fiscal and net foreign currency transaction gains of million in fiscal 
table of contents critical accounting policies in presenting our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles  we are required to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported therein 
some of the estimates and assumptions we are required to make relate to matters that are inherently uncertain as they pertain to future events 
we base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable and appropriate 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates 
the following is a description of our accounting policies that we believe require subjective and complex judgments  which could potentially have a material effect on our reported financial condition or results of operations 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policy is based on complex rules that require us to make significant judgments and estimates 
in applying our revenue recognition policy  we must determine which portions of our revenue are recognized currently generally software revenue and which portions must be deferred and recognized in future periods generally services revenue 
we analyze various factors including  but not limited to  the sales of undelivered services when sold on a stand alone basis  our pricing policies  the credit worthiness of our customers and resellers  accounts receivable aging data and contractual terms and conditions in helping us to make such judgments about revenue recognition 
changes in judgment on any of these factors could materially impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized in a given period 
currently  we derive revenues from two primary sources  or elements software licenses and services 
services include customer support  consulting  assessment and design services  installation services and training 
a typical sales arrangement includes both of these elements 
for sales arrangements involving multiple elements  we recognize revenue using the residual method 
under the residual method  we allocate and defer revenue for the undelivered elements based on relative fair value and recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered elements as revenue 
the determination of fair value of the undelivered elements in multiple element arrangements is based on the price charged when such elements are sold separately  which is commonly referred to as vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
our software licenses typically provide for a perpetual right to use our software and are sold on a per copy basis  on a capacity basis or as site licenses 
software licenses sold on a capacity basis provide the customer with unlimited licenses of specified software products based on a defined level of terabytes of data under management 
site licenses give the customer the additional right to deploy the software on a limited basis during a specified term 
we recognize software revenue through direct sales channels upon receipt of a purchase order or other persuasive evidence and when the other three basic revenue recognition criteria are met as described in the revenue recognition section in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
we recognize software revenue through all indirect sales channels on a sell through model 
a sell through model requires that we recognize revenue when the basic revenue recognition criteria are met and these channels complete the sale of our software products to the end user 
revenue from software licenses sold through an original equipment manufacturer partner is recognized upon the receipt of a royalty report or purchase order from that original equipment manufacturer partner 
services revenue includes revenue from customer support and other professional services 
customer support includes software updates on a when and if available basis  telephone support  integrated web based support and bug fixes or patches 
customer support revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the customer support agreement  which is typically one year 
to determine the price for the customer support element when sold separately  we primarily use historical renewal rates and  in certain cases  we use stated renewal rates 
historical renewal rates are supported by a rolling month vsoe analysis in which we segregate our customer support renewal contracts into different classes based on specific criteria including  but not limited to  dollar amount of software purchased  level of customer support being provided and distribution channel 
the purpose of such an analysis is to determine if the customer support element that is deferred at the time of a software sale is consistent with how it is sold on a stand alone renewal basis 
our other professional services include consulting  assessment and design services  installation services and training 
other professional services provided by us are not mandatory and can also be performed by the customer or a third party 
in addition to a signed purchase order  our consulting  assessment and design services and installation services are  in some cases  evidenced by a statement of work  which defines the specific scope of the services to be performed when sold and performed on a stand alone basis or included in multiple element sales arrangements 
revenues from consulting  assessment and design services and installation services are based upon a daily  weekly or monthly rate and are recognized when the services are completed 
training includes courses taught by our instructors or third party contractors either at one of our facilities or at the customer s site 
training fees are recognized after the training course has been provided 
based on our analysis of such other professional services transactions sold on a stand alone basis  we have concluded we have established vsoe for such other professional services when sold in connection with a multiple element sales arrangement 

table of contents in summary  we have analyzed all of the undelivered elements included in our multiple element sales arrangements and determined that we have vsoe of fair value to allocate revenues to services 
our analysis of the undelivered elements has provided us with results that are consistent with the estimates and assumptions used to determine the timing and amount of revenue recognized in our multiple element sales arrangements 
accordingly  assuming all basic revenue recognition criteria are met  software revenue is recognized upon delivery of the software license using the residual method 
we are not likely to materially change our pricing and discounting practices in the future 
our sales arrangements generally do not include acceptance clauses 
however  if an arrangement does include an acceptance clause  we defer the revenue for such an arrangement and recognize it upon acceptance 
acceptance occurs upon the earliest of receipt of a written customer acceptance  waiver of customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
stock based compensation as of march   we maintain two stock incentive plans  which are described more fully in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
we account for our stock incentive plans under the fair value recognition provisions  which we adopted on april  using the modified prospective method 
under this transition method  our stock based compensation costs beginning april  are based on a combination of the following all options granted prior to  but not vested as of april   based on the grant date fair value in accordance with the original provisions of asc and all options and restricted stock units granted subsequent to april   based on the grant date fair value 
we estimated the fair value of stock options granted using the black scholes formula 
the fair value of restricted stock units awarded is determined based on the number of shares granted and the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant 
compensation for all share based payment awards is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the awards  which is generally the vesting period 
forfeitures are estimated based on a historical analysis of our actual stock award forfeitures 
the average expected life was determined according to the simplified method  which is the mid point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term 
we currently use the simplified method to estimate the expected term for share option grants as we do not have enough historical experience to provide a reasonable estimate due to the limited period our equity shares have been publicly traded 
we will continue to use the simplified method until we have enough historical experience to provide a reasonable estimate of expected term 
the risk free interest rate is determined by reference to us treasury yield curve rates with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant 
we anticipate that future grants under our stock incentive plans will include both non qualified stock options and restricted stock units 
expected volatility through the quarter ended september  was calculated based on reported data for a peer group of publicly traded companies for which historical information was available 
during the quarter ended december   we began to incorporate our own data into the expected volatility assumption 
we modified our expected volatility calculation because at that time our common stock had been publically traded for years and we believe that commvault specific volatility inputs should be included in the calculation of expected volatility 
as a result  expected volatility for the second half of fiscal and all of fiscal and was calculated based on a blended approach that included historical volatility of a peer group  the implied volatility of our traded options with a remaining maturity greater than six months and the historical realized volatility of our common stock from the date of our initial public offering to the respective stock option grant date 

table of contents the assumptions used in the black scholes option pricing model in the fiscal year ended march  and are as follows year ended march  dividend yield none none expected volatility weighted average expected volatility risk free interest rates expected life in years the weighted average fair value of stock options granted was per share during the year ended march  and per share during the year ended march  in addition  the weighted average fair value of restricted stock units awarded was per share during the year ended march  and per share during the year ended march  as of march   there was approximately million of unrecognized stock based compensation expense  net of estimated forfeitures  related to non vested stock option and restricted stock unit awards that is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
the intrinsic value of the options outstanding as of march  was million  of which million related to vested options and million related to unvested options 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure  including assessing the risks associated with tax audits  and assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
as of march   we had net deferred tax assets of approximately million  which were primarily related to federal and state research tax credit carryforwards  stock based compensation and foreign net operating loss carryforwards 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent that we believe recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
during fiscal  we recorded valuation allowances totaling million against our deferred tax assets 
specifically  we recorded a valuation allowance of million against certain state research tax credits due to uncertainties related to the ability to utilize such state research tax credits before they expire 
we based our valuation allowance on our estimates of taxable income by legal entity and the period over which its state research tax credits will be recoverable 
in addition  we recorded a valuation allowance of million against foreign net operating loss carryforwards in a certain international jurisdiction 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance against our net operating loss carryforwards in such international jurisdiction  we considered projected future income as part of our analysis 
at march   we have state net operating loss nol carryforwards of approximately million and also have nol carryforwards for foreign tax purposes of approximately million 
at march   we have federal and state research tax credit r d carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the federal research tax credit carryforwards expire from through  and the state research tax credit carryforwards expire from through at march   we have federal alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of million 
as of march   we had unrecognized tax benefits of million  all of which  if recognized  would favorably affect the effective tax rate 
in addition  we have accrued interest and penalties of million related to the unrecognized tax benefits 
interest and penalties  if any  related to unrecognized tax benefits are recorded in income tax expense 
components of the reserve are classified as either current or long term in the consolidated balance sheet based on when we expect each of the items to be settled 
accordingly  our unrecognized tax benefits of million and the related accrued interest and penalties of million are included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
we believe that it is reasonably possible that approximately million of our currently remaining unrecognized tax benefits and approximately million of related accrued interest and penalties may be realized by the end of fiscal as a result of the lapse of the statute of limitations 
we conduct business globally and as a result  file income tax returns in the united states and in various state and foreign jurisdictions 
in the normal course of business  we are subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world  including such major jurisdictions as the united states  australia  canada  germany  netherlands and united kingdom 
we are currently not under audit in any tax jurisdiction 

table of contents the following table summarizes the tax years in the major tax jurisdictions that remain subject to income tax examinations by tax authorities as of march  the years subject to income tax examination in our foreign jurisdictions cover the maximum time period with respect to these jurisdictions 
due to nol carryforwards  in some cases the tax years continue to remain subject to examination with respect to such nols 
years subject to income tax jurisdiction tax examination us federal present new jersey present foreign jurisdictions present software development costs research and development expenditures are charged to operations as incurred 
based on our software development process  technological feasibility is established upon completion of a working model  which also requires certification and extensive testing 
costs incurred by us between completion of the working model and the point at which the product is ready for general release are immaterial 
results of operations the following table sets forth each of our sources of revenues and costs of revenues for the specified periods as a percentage of our total revenues for those periods year ended march  revenues software services total revenues cost of revenues software services total cost of revenues gross margin fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  revenues total revenues increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal software revenue 
software revenue increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal software revenue represented of our total revenues in fiscal compared to in fiscal the increase in software revenue is primarily due to increased software revenue derived from our foreign locations  which increased while software revenue derived from the united states grew in fiscal compared to fiscal the growth in software revenue in foreign locations is primarily due to increases in europe  canada  australia and asia as we expand our international operations 
software revenue derived from enterprise software transactions transactions greater than million increased by million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result  software revenue derived from enterprise software transactions represented approximately of our software revenue in fiscal and approximately of our software revenue in fiscal the increase in software revenue derived from enterprise transactions is primarily due to an increase in the number of transactions of this type 
the average dollar amount of such transactions was approximately  in fiscal and was approximately  in fiscal software revenue derived from transactions less than million increased million  or in fiscal compared to fiscal 
table of contents software revenue derived from our indirect distribution channel resellers and original equipment manufacturers increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal  and software revenue through our direct sales force increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in the dollar value of the software revenue through our indirect distribution channel is primarily due to the higher growth percentage of software generated in foreign locations  which is substantially sold through our channel partners 
software revenue that is derived from both our indirect channel partners and direct sales force are key attributes to our long term growth strategy 
we will continue to invest in both our channel relationships and direct sales force in the future  but we continue to expect more revenue to be generated through indirect distribution channels over the long term as more fully discussed above in the sources of revenue section 
services revenue 
services revenue increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal services revenue represented of our total revenues in fiscal compared to in fiscal the increase in services revenue is primarily due to a million increase in revenue from customer support agreements as a result of software sales to new customers and renewal agreements with our installed software base

cost of software revenue decreased approximately million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal cost of software revenue represented of our total software revenue in both fiscal and the decrease in cost of software revenue is primarily due to lower distribution and third party media costs related to our simpana software suite in fiscal compared to fiscal cost of services revenue 
cost of services revenue increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal cost of services revenue represented of our services revenue in fiscal compared to in fiscal the increase in cost of services revenue is primarily the result of higher employee compensation and travel expenses totaling approximately million 
operating expenses sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase is primarily due to a million increase in employee compensation and related expenses primarily attributable to the expansion of our sales force from the prior year and higher commissions due to record software revenue in fiscal sales and marketing expenses also increased due to a million increase in marketing expenses as we continue to build brand awareness for our simpana software products  a million increase in travel and related expenses and a million increase in employee benefits expense 
sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased to in fiscal from in fiscal research and development 
research and development expenses increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase is primarily due to million of higher employee compensation resulting from the expansion of our engineering group  a million increase legal fees primarily associated with patent registration and a million increase in employee benefits expense 
research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenues was relatively flat at in both fiscal and fiscal investing in research and development has been a priority for commvault  and we anticipate continued spending related to the development of our data and information management software applications 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase is primarily due to million of higher employee compensation due to higher headcount and higher fiscal bonuses  a million increase in stock based compensation expense and a million increase in legal fees 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues were relatively flat at in both fiscal and 
table of contents depreciation and amortization 
depreciation expense increased million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this reflects higher depreciation associated with increase capital expenditures primarily for product development and other computer related equipment 
interest income interest income increased million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in interest income is primarily due to higher balances in our cash and related investment accounts 
income tax expense income tax expense was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the effective tax rate in fiscal was as compared to in fiscal in fiscal  the effective rate is higher than the expected federal statutory rate of primarily due to recording a valuation allowance against certain state research tax credits as well as the impact of state income taxes and permanent differences in both the united states and foreign jurisdictions 
these items were partially offset by the reversal of certain tax reserves as a result of the expiration of a statute of limitations in a foreign jurisdiction as well as recording additional research tax credits 
in fiscal  the effective rate is higher than the expected federal statutory rate of primarily due to state income taxes  adjustments to foreign tax credits and permanent differences in both the united states and foreign jurisdictions  partially offset by recording additional research tax credits 
fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  revenues total revenues increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal software revenue 
software revenue increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal software revenue represented of our total revenues in fiscal compared to in fiscal the increase in software revenue is primarily driven by higher software revenue derived from our us operations  which increased compared to fiscal software revenue from our foreign locations was relatively flat in fiscal compared to fiscal software revenue derived from enterprise software transactions transactions greater than million represented approximately of our software revenue in fiscal and approximately of our software revenue in fiscal as a result  enterprise software transactions increased by million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase was primarily driven by the strength from our us operations as well as a increase in the total number of transactions of this type 
the average dollar amount of such transactions was approximately  in fiscal and was approximately  in fiscal the overall increase in enterprise software transactions was partially offset by a decrease in software transactions less than million as a result of lower software revenue transactions of this type from our foreign locations 
software revenue through our indirect distribution channel resellers and original equipment manufacturers increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal  while software revenue derived from our direct sales force decreased million in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in software revenue generated through our indirect distribution channel is primarily due to more enterprise software transactions in our us operations that were transacted through indirect distribution channels 
overall  we believe growth in our software revenue that is derived from both our indirect channel partners and direct sales force are key attributes to our long term growth strategy 
we will continue to invest in both our channel relationships and direct sales force in the future  but we continue to expect more revenue to be generated through indirect distribution channels over the long term 
services revenue 
services revenue increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal services revenue represented of our total revenues in fiscal compared to in fiscal the increase in services revenue is primarily due to a million increase in revenue from customer support agreements as a result of software sales to new customers and renewal agreements with our installed software base

in addition  we have approximately million of short term investments invested in certificates of deposit at march  in recent fiscal years  our principal sources of liquidity have been cash provided by operations 
historically  our principle source of liquidity had been cash provided by private placements of preferred equity securities and common stock and cash provided from our public offerings of common stock 
in july  we entered into an amended and restated credit facility in which we can borrow up to million over a three year period 
borrowings under the facility are available to repurchase our common stock under our share repurchase program and to provide for working capital and general corporate purposes 
repayments of principal amounts borrowed under the amended and restated credit facility is required at the maturity date of july the credit facility also requires that certain financial covenants be met on a quarterly basis 
the amended and restated credit facility contains financial covenants that require us to maintain a quick ratio and minimum earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  as defined in the credit agreement

as a result  we may repurchase an additional million of our common stock through march  the primary business reason for our stock repurchase program is to reduce the dilutive impact on our common shares outstanding associated with stock option exercises and our previous public and private stock offerings 
under our stock repurchase program  we have bought back approximately of the common stock that was outstanding at the time the stock repurchase program was announced 
in addition  at the time we implemented our stock repurchase program in late fiscal we believed that our share price was undervalued and the best use for a portion of our cash balance was to repurchase some of our outstanding common stock 
our future stock repurchase activity is subject to the business judgment of our management and board of directors  taking into consideration our historical and projected results of operations  financial condition  cash flows and other anticipated capital requirements or investment alternatives

table of contents we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents  cash from operations and our million credit facility will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital  capital expenditures and potential stock repurchases for at least the next months 
we may seek additional funding through public or private financings or other arrangements during this period 
adequate funds may not be available when needed or may not be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  dilution to existing stockholders will result 
if we raise additional funds by obtaining loans from third parties  the terms of those financing arrangements may include negative covenants or other restrictions on our business that could impair our operational flexibility  and would also require us to fund additional interest expense 
if funding is insufficient at any time in the future  we may be unable to develop or enhance our products or services  take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
summary disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial commitments our material capital commitments consist of obligations under facilities and operating leases 
some of these leases have free or escalating rent payment provisions 
we recognize rent expense under leases on a straight line basis 
we anticipate that we will experience an increase in our capital expenditures and lease commitments consistent with our anticipated growth in operations  infrastructure  personnel and resources devoted to building our brand name and marketing and sales force 
the following table summarizes our obligations as of march  dollars in thousands payments due by period more less than than total year years years years operating lease obligations purchase obligations total we generally do not enter into binding purchase obligations 
the purchase obligations above relate primarily to software licensing and it infrastructure costs 
the contractual obligations table above excludes unrecognized tax benefits recorded in other liabilities totaling million because we cannot reasonably estimate in which future periods these amounts will ultimately be settled 
the million is classified as a long term liability in our consolidated balance sheet as of march  as none of these obligations are anticipated to be paid within one year from april  we have certain software royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products 
royalty expense is generally based on the number of units shipped or a percentage of the underlying revenue 
royalty expense  included in cost of software revenues  was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal we offer a day limited product warranty for our software 
to date  costs relating to this product warranty have not been material 
off balance sheet arrangements as of march  and  other than our operating leases  we do not have off balance sheet financing arrangements  including any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities 
indemnifications certain of our software licensing agreements contain certain provisions that indemnify our customers from any claim  suit or proceeding arising from alleged or actual intellectual property infringement 
these provisions continue in perpetuity along with our software licensing agreements 
we have never incurred a liability relating to one of these indemnification provisions in the past and we believe that the likelihood of any future payout relating to these provisions is remote 
therefore  we have not recorded a liability during any period related to these indemnification provisions 

table of contents impact of recently issued accounting standards fair value measurements in january  the fasb issued guidance requiring additional disclosure for significant transfers in and out of levels and fair value measurements and the reasons for such transfers 
this new guidance also requires separate disclosure information about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements on a gross basis rather than as one net number in the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs level 
in addition  this guidance clarifies existing disclosures regarding fair value measurement for each class of assets and liabilities and the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements that fall in either level or level the changes under this new guidance were effective for the quarterly period beginning january   except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the roll forward of activity in level fair value measurements  which are effective for the company s fiscal year beginning april  the adoption of these new accounting pronouncements will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk as of march   our cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances consisted primarily of money market funds and certificates of deposit 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we are not subject to any material interest rate risk on these balances 
in july  we entered into a credit facility in which we could borrow up to million over the initial months of the credit facility 
the credit facility expired in july because no amounts were borrowed during the initial months of the credit facility 
in july  we entered into an amended and restated credit facility in which we can borrow up to million over a three year period 
borrowings under the amended and restated credit facility bear interest  at our option  at either i libor plus a margin ranging from to or ii the bank s base rate plus a margin ranging from to 
the bank s base rate is defined as the higher of the federal funds rate plus  one month libor plus  or the lender s prime rate 
there are no outstanding balances on the amended and restated credit facility 
as a result  we are currently not subject to any material interest rate risk on our credit facility 
foreign currency risk economic exposure as a global company  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
our international sales are generally denominated in foreign currencies  and this revenue could be materially affected by currency fluctuations 
approximately of our sales were outside the united states in fiscal and were outside the united states in fiscal our primary exposures are to fluctuations in exchange rates for the us dollar versus the euro  and to a lesser extent  the australian dollar  british pound sterling  canadian dollar  chinese yuan  indian rupee  korean won and singapore dollar 
changes in currency exchange rates could adversely affect our reported revenues and require us to reduce our prices to remain competitive in foreign markets  which could also have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
historically  we have periodically reviewed and revised the pricing of our products available to our customers in foreign countries and we have not maintained excess cash balances in foreign accounts 
we estimate that a change in all foreign exchange rates would impact our reported operating profit by approximately million annually 
this sensitivity analysis disregards the possibilities that rates can move in opposite directions and that losses from one geographic area may be offset by gains from another geographic area 

table of contents transaction exposure our exposure to foreign currency transaction gains and losses is primarily the result of certain net receivables due from our foreign subsidiaries and customers being denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary 
our foreign subsidiaries conduct their businesses in local currency and we generally do not maintain excess us dollar cash balances in foreign accounts 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recorded in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income 
we recognized net foreign currency transaction gains losses of approximately million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal the net foreign currency transaction losses recorded in general and administrative expenses include settlement gains and losses on forward contracts disclosed below 
to date  we have selectively hedged our exposure to foreign currency transaction gains and losses on the balance sheet through the use of forward contracts  which were not designated as hedging instruments 
the duration of forward contracts utilized for hedging our balance sheet exposure is approximately one month 
as of march  and march   we did not have any forward contracts outstanding 
we recorded net realized gains losses in general and administrative expenses of million in fiscal and less than million in fiscal in the future  we may enter into additional foreign currency based hedging contracts to reduce our exposure to significant fluctuations in currency exchange rates on the balance sheet
