table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview legg mason  inc  a holding company  with its subsidiaries which collectively comprise legg mason is a global asset management firm 
acting through our subsidiaries  we provide investment management and related services to institutional and individual clients  company sponsored mutual funds and other investment vehicles 
we offer these products and services directly and through various financial intermediaries 
we have operations principally in the united states of america and the united kingdom and also have offices in australia  bahamas  brazil  canada  chile  china  dubai  france  germany  italy  japan  luxembourg  poland  singapore  spain and taiwan 
we currently operate in one reportable business segment  asset management  and manage our business in two divisions or operating segments  americas and international  which are primarily based on the geographic location of the advisor or the domicile of fund families we manage 
the americas division consists of our us domiciled fund families  the separate account businesses of our us based investment affiliates and the domestic distribution organization 
similarly  the international division consists of our fund complexes  distribution teams and investment affiliates located outside the us in december  we announced a realignment of our executive management team which  among other things  will eliminate the previous separation of the americas and international divisions into one global asset management business during fiscal we believe this new structure will allow us to function as a global organization with a single purpose and allow us to focus on future growth opportunities 
as of march   there has been no change to the internal executive management reporting and we continued to operate in one reportable business segment  asset management  with two divisions  americas and international 
our operating revenues primarily consist of investment advisory fees  from separate accounts and funds  and distribution and service fees 
investment advisory fees are generally calculated as a percentage of the assets of the investment portfolios that we manage 
in addition  performance fees may be earned under certain investment advisory contracts for exceeding performance benchmarks 
distribution and service fees are fees received for distributing investment products and services or for providing other support services to investment portfolios  and are generally calculated as a percentage of the assets in an investment portfolio or as a percentage of new assets added to an investment portfolio 
our revenues  therefore  are dependent upon the level of our assets under management  and thus are affected by factors such as securities market conditions  our ability to attract and maintain assets under management and key investment personnel  and investment performance 
our assets under management primarily vary from period to period due to inflows and outflows of client assets and market performance 
client decisions to increase or decrease their assets under our management  and decisions by potential clients to utilize our services  may be based on one or more of a number of factors 
these factors include our reputation in the marketplace  the investment performance  both absolute and relative to benchmarks or competitive products  of our products and services  the fees we charge for our investment services  the client or potential client situation  including investment objectives  liquidity needs  investment horizon and amount of assets managed  our relationships with distributors and the external economic environment  including market conditions 
the fees that we charge for our investment services vary based upon factors such as the type of underlying investment product  the amount of assets under management  and the type of services and investment objectives that are provided 
fees charged for equity asset management services are generally higher than fees charged for fixed income and liquidity asset management services 
accordingly  our revenues will be affected by the composition of our assets under management 
in addition  in the ordinary course of our business  we may reduce or waive investment management fees  or limit total expenses  on certain products or services for particular time periods to manage fund expenses  or for other reasons  and to help retain or increase managed assets 
under revenue sharing agreements  certain of our affiliates retain different percentages of revenues to cover their costs  including compensation 
as such  our net income attributable to legg mason  inc  operating margin and compensation as a percentage of operating revenues are impacted based on which affiliates generate our revenues  and a change in assets under management at one subsidiary can have a dramatically different effect on our revenues and earnings than an equal change at another subsidiary 
in addition  from time to time we may agree to changes in revenue sharing agreements and other 
table of contents arrangements with our asset management personnel  which may impact our compensation expenses and profitability 
the most significant component of our cost structure is employee compensation and benefits  of which a majority is variable in nature and includes incentive compensation that is primarily based upon revenue levels and profits 
the next largest component of our cost structure is distribution and servicing fees  which are primarily fees paid to third party distributors for selling our asset management products and services and are largely variable in nature 
certain other operating costs are fixed in nature  such as occupancy  depreciation and amortization  and fixed contract commitments for market data  communication and technology services  and usually do not decline with reduced levels of business activity or  conversely  usually do not rise proportionately with increased business activity 
our financial position and results of operations are materially affected by the overall trends and conditions of the financial markets  particularly in the united states  but increasingly in the other countries in which we operate 
results of any individual period should not be considered representative of future results 
our profitability is sensitive to a variety of factors  including the amount and composition of our assets under management  and the volatility and general level of securities prices and interest rates  among other things 
sustained periods of unfavorable market conditions are likely to affect our profitability adversely 
in addition  the diversification of services and products offered  investment performance  access to distribution channels  reputation in the market  attracting and retaining key employees and client relations are significant factors in determining whether we are successful in attracting and retaining clients 
the economic downturn of fiscal years and contributed to a significant contraction in our business 
we have experienced improvement over the past two years  although we have not recovered to pre downturn levels 
the financial services business in which we are engaged is extremely competitive 
our competition includes numerous global  national  regional and local asset management firms  broker dealers and commercial banks 
the industry has been impacted by continued economic uncertainty  and in prior years by the consolidation of financial services firms through mergers and acquisitions 
the industry in which we operate is also subject to extensive regulation under federal  state  and foreign laws 
like most firms  we have been impacted by the regulatory and legislative changes 
responding to these changes has required  and will continue to require  us to incur costs that continue to impact our profitability

terms such as we  us  our  and company refer to legg mason 
business environment and results of operations the financial environment globally and in the united states continued to rebound during fiscal  but challenging conditions persisted throughout most of our fiscal year due to uncertainties surrounding the strength of the economic recovery  continued concerns over budget deficits  and high levels of unemployment 
the impact of the earthquake that occurred in japan in march  along with political unrest in the middle east  have created new uncertainties 
in spite of these global concerns  the markets continued to increase due to steady improvement in consumer confidence  stabilization of still elevated unemployment rates  and improved performance in corporate earnings across many sectors 
during fiscal  the federal reserve board held the discount rate at  the lowest in history 
the financial environment in which we operate continues to be challenging moving into fiscal all three major us equity market indices  as well as the barclays capital us aggregate bond index and barclays capital global aggregate bond index  increased significantly during the past two fiscal years as illustrated in the table below change for the year ended march  indices dow jones industrial average s p nasdaq composite index barclays capital us aggregate bond index barclays capital global aggregate bond index indices are trademarks of dow jones company  mcgraw hill companies  inc  nasdaq stock market  inc  and barclays capital  respectively  which are not affiliated with legg mason

table of contents fiscal compared with fiscal financial overview net income attributable to legg mason  inc for the year ended march  totaled million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  in the prior year 
the increase in net income was primarily due to the net impact of increased operating revenues  reflecting a more favorable asset mix and increased performance fees  reduced interest expense  and a change in the uk tax rate 
these increases were offset in part by the impact of transition related compensation  the impact of gains on fund support recognized in the prior year  and an increase in costs associated with closed end fund launches 
these items are further discussed in results of operations below 
adjusted income see supplemental non gaap financial information was million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  in the prior year 
this increase was primarily due to the increase in net income  as previously discussed  excluding the impact of the current year uk tax rate change and fund support gains in the prior year

assets under management the components of the changes in our assets under management aum in billions for the years ended march were as follows beginning of period investment funds  excluding liquidity funds subscriptions redemptions separate account flows  net liquidity fund flows  net net client cash flows market performance and other dispositions end of period subscriptions and redemptions reflect the gross activity in the funds and include assets transferred between funds and between share classes 
includes impact of foreign exchange 
aum at march  was billion  a decrease of billion or from march  the decrease in aum was attributable to net client outflows of billion  which were partially offset by market appreciation of billion  of which approximately resulted from the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuation  and dispositions of billion  relating to the sale of a singapore based asian equity manager 
the majority of outflows were in fixed income with billion  or of the outflows  followed by liquidity outflows and equity outflows of billion and billion  respectively 
the majority of fixed income outflows were in products managed by western asset management company western asset 
we have experienced outflows in our fixed income asset class since fiscal equity outflows were primarily experienced by products managed at clearbridge advisors llc clearbridge and legg mason capital management  inc lmcm  while the permal group  ltd 
permal and royce associates royce had net inflows 
due in part to investment performance issues  we have experienced net annual equity outflows since fiscal however  the rate of outflows in this asset class was lower year over year 
we generally earn higher fees and profits on equity aum  and outflows in this asset class will more negatively impact our revenues and net income than would outflows in other asset classes 
during the first quarter of fiscal  morgan stanley smith barney amended certain historical smith barney brokerage programs providing for investment in liquidity funds that our asset managers manage  that resulted in a reduction of approximately billion in liquidity aum 
we are currently waiving much of the management fees generated by these assets  so a loss of this aum this year would have reduced net advisory revenue by only million and not had a material impact on net income due to the impact of revenue sharing arrangements and income taxes 
in addition  we expect further amendments to result in an additional billion in liquidity assets being transferred over the next months 
our investment advisory and administrative contracts are generally terminable at will or upon relatively short notice  and investors in the mutual funds that we manage may redeem their investments in the funds at any time without prior notice 
institutional and individual clients can terminate their relationships with us  reduce the aggregate amount of assets under management  or shift their funds to other types of accounts with different rate structures for any number of reasons  including investment performance  changes in prevailing interest rates  changes in our reputation in the marketplace  changes in management or control of clients or third party distributors with whom we have relationships  loss of key investment management personnel or financial market performance

the equity markets worked through a difficult year with more recent political upheaval in the middle east driving a significant increase in oil prices and the earthquake in japan and subsequent nuclear crisis raising questions about the future of the nuclear power industry 
despite these global concerns  most us indices produced positive returns for our fourth fiscal quarter and our full fiscal year driven by corporate earnings growth resulting in increases in dividends  share buybacks  and mergers and acquisitions activity 
in the fixed income markets  relatively strong economic data  combined with continued accommodative monetary and fiscal policy  continued to alleviate fears of a double dip recession and caused us treasury yields to rise across the yield curve 
the yield curve slightly flattened over the quarter and the year as the federal reserve kept its funds rate at and reiterated that rates would be kept low for an extended period 
the worst performing fixed income sector for the year was government bonds as measured by the barclays us government bond index returning  in contrast to high yield bonds  as measured by the barclays high yield bond index  which returned followed by us tips  as measured by the barclays us tips index  which returned for the year

table of contents business model streamlining initiative in may  we announced an initiative to streamline our business model to drive increased profitability and growth that includes i transitioning certain shared services to our investment affiliates which are closer to the actual client relationships  and ii sharing in affiliate revenue with our americas distribution group 
we project that the initiative will result in million to million in expense reductions that will be fully realized on an annualized basis by the fourth quarter of fiscal these expense savings consist of i approximately million in compensation and benefits cost reductions from eliminating positions in certain corporate shared services functions as a result of transitioning such functions to the affiliates  and charging affiliates for other centralized services that will continue to be provided to them without any corresponding adjustment in revenue sharing or other compensation arrangements  ii approximately million in non compensation costs from eliminating and streamlining activities in our corporate and distribution business units  including savings associated with consolidating office space  and iii approximately million from our americas distribution group sharing in affiliate revenues from retail assets under management without any corresponding adjustment in revenue sharing or other compensation arrangements 
the initiative involves approximately million to million in transition related costs that primarily include charges for employee termination benefits and incentives to retain employees during the transition period 
the transition related costs will also include charges for consolidating leased office space  early contract terminations  asset disposals and professional fees 
during fiscal  transition related costs totaled million  which  net of related cost savings  reduced our operating income by million 
substantially all of the remaining costs will be accrued in fiscal the nature and amount of transition costs and savings are based on estimates 
while management expects the total costs and savings to be within the ranges disclosed  actual results may differ in amount and nature from these estimates 
the achievement of all projected cost savings and margin improvements  as well as the amount and nature of transition related costs  will be subject to many factors  including market conditions and other factors affecting our financial results  and those of our affiliates  and the rate of aum growth 
in addition  our business is dynamic and may require us to incur incremental expenses from time to time to grow and better support our business 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on our business streamlining initiative 
results of operations effective with the april  adoption of a new accounting standard on consolidation  we consolidate and separately identify certain sponsored investment vehicles  the most significant of which is a collateralized loan obligation entity clo 
the consolidation of these investment vehicles has no impact on net income attributable to legg mason  inc and does not have a material impact on our consolidated operating results 
we also hold investments in certain consolidated sponsored investment funds and the change in the value of these investments  which is recorded in other non operating income expense  is reflected in our net income  net of amounts allocated to noncontrolling interests

operating revenues total operating revenues for the year ended march  were billion  an increase of from billion in the prior year  despite a decrease in average aum  reflecting increased revenue yields due to a more favorable asset mix and higher performance fees 
these increases were offset in part by an increase in fee waivers on certain liquidity funds in order to maintain certain yields to investors 
investment advisory fees from separate accounts were relatively flat at million  as a decrease of million  resulting from lower average fixed income assets at western asset  was offset by an million increase due to higher average equity assets managed by batterymarch financial management  inc batterymarch and royce  a million increase due to higher average fixed income assets managed by brandywine global management  llc brandywine  and a million increase due to subordinate fees received from certain clos managed by western asset 
investment advisory fees from funds increased million  or  to billion 
of this increase  million was the result of higher average equity assets managed at royce  permal  and clearbridge  and 
table of contents million was the result of higher average fixed income assets managed at western asset 
these increases were offset in part by a million decrease due to lower average liquidity assets managed at western asset and a million decrease as a result of fee waivers on liquidity funds managed by western asset  primarily to maintain certain yields to investors 
performance fees increased  or million  to million during fiscal  driven by fees earned on assets managed at western asset  permal and brandywine 
distribution and service fees increased to million  primarily as a result of an increase in average mutual fund aum subject to distribution and servicing fees offset in part by the impact of increased fee waivers related to liquidity funds managed by western asset 
operating expenses total compensation and benefits increased million to billion 
compensation and benefits  excluding transition related compensation of million  which represents severance and retention incentive costs  increased million  or  to billion 
this increase was driven by a million increase in revenue share based compensation resulting from higher revenues and a reduction in operating expenses at revenue share based affiliates in fiscal and a million increase in incentive compensation for non revenue share based affiliates and administrative and sales personnel 
these increases were offset in part by a million reduction in deferred compensation obligations due to the impact of reduced market gains on assets invested for deferred compensation plans  which are recorded in other non operating income expense  as well as  a million reduction in deferred compensation expense at non revenue share based affiliates 
the impact of reduced headcount  primarily related to our business streamlining initiatives  also reduced compensation and benefits by million 
compensation as a percentage of operating revenues increased to from in the prior fiscal year primarily due to the impact of increased revenues at revenue share based affiliates that retain a higher percentage of revenues as compensation  and transition related compensation 
these increases were substantially offset by the impact of compensation decreases related to reduced market gains on assets invested for deferred compensation plans and seed capital investments and the impact of lower corporate compensation on increased revenues 
we have an arrangement with an affiliate under which the affiliate incentive compensation pool under a revenue sharing agreement has been reduced over the last two years to reimburse the parent company for certain expenses  while at the same time the parent company has provided an equivalent amount of deferred compensation to the affiliate employees 
a portion of the deferred compensation was granted in the form of restricted stock awards and the remainder in cash awards granted under a non qualified plan  both of which will vest over periods of three to four years 
the amount by which the affiliate incentive compensation will be reduced in fiscal under the arrangement will be significantly less than the reduction in fiscal in addition  there will be an increase in the amount of non cash amortization expense associated with the vesting of the deferred compensation awards from prior years 
the combined impact will result in a million increase in compensation and benefits in fiscal  which will be recognized ratably over the year 
this arrangement will continue for the subsequent five years  however  the incremental effect on compensation expense from year to year will be far less significant 
distribution and servicing expenses increased to million  primarily as a result of an increase in average aum in certain products for which we pay fees to third party distributors and an increase of million in structuring fees related to closed end fund launches offset in part by the impact of liquidity fund fee waivers that reduce the amounts paid to our distributors 
communications and technology expense decreased to million  of which million resulted from the full depreciation of certain assets prior to or during the current year  offset in part by a million increase in technology consulting and outsourcing fees  primarily related to our business streamlining initiatives 
occupancy expense decreased to million  primarily due to the impact of a million charge in the prior year as a result of subleasing space in our corporate headquarters in fiscal amortization of intangibles remained relatively flat at million 
other expenses increased million to million  primarily as a result of a million increase in travel and entertainment and advertising costs  a million increase in state franchise taxes  a million increase in professional fees  and a million increase in charges 
table of contents related to trading errors and expense reimbursements paid to certain mutual funds 
these increases were offset in part by the impact of a million investor settlement in the prior year 
non operating income expense interest income increased to million driven by higher average interest rates  offset in part by a million decrease due to lower average investment balances 
interest expense decreased to million  primarily as a result of the exchange of our equity units in august and the repayment of the million outstanding term loan balance in january  which reduced interest expense by million and million  respectively 
as of march   all fund support arrangements had expired or were terminated in accordance with their terms 
fund support gains were million in the prior year 
the gains primarily represent the reversal of unrealized  non cash losses recorded in fiscal on liquidity fund support arrangements for our offshore funds 
other non operating income expense decreased million  primarily as a result of a million reduction in unrealized market gains on assets invested for deferred compensation plans  which were substantially offset by corresponding compensation decreases discussed above  and a million reduction in unrealized market gains on investments in proprietary fund products 
these decreases were offset in part by the impact of million in charges related to the exchange of our equity units in the prior year 
other non operating income expense of civs decreased million  to a gain of million  due to losses associated with an increase in fair value of the debt related to a civ 
income tax provision the provision for income taxes was million compared to million in the prior year 
during fiscal  the uk finance bill of was enacted  which reduced the corporate tax rate from to for periods beginning after april  the impact of the tax rate change on certain existing deferred tax liabilities resulted in a tax benefit of approximately million 
the effective tax rate was compared to in the prior year 
the effective tax rate  excluding the impact of civs  was and as of march  and  respectively 
this decrease was primarily driven by the revaluation of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the enactment of the uk tax rate reduction and adjustments to state tax rates impacted by apportionment changes 
in addition  the current period benefited from adjustments resulting from the finalization of prior period tax positions 
although not yet enacted  additional proposed reductions in the uk corporate tax rate to in fiscal and in fiscal are expected 
each one percentage point reduction in the uk corporate tax rate will result in a tax benefit of approximately million at the time of enactment  based on the amount of deferred tax assets and liabilities as of march   that have to be revalued at the new rate 
supplemental non gaap financial information consolidated statements of income  excluding consolidated investment vehicles effective with the april  adoption of a new financial accounting standard on consolidation  we now consolidate and separately identify certain sponsored investment vehicles  the most significant of which is a clo 
in presenting our consolidated statements of income  excluding consolidated investment vehicles  we add back the investment advisory and distribution and servicing fees that are eliminated upon the consolidation of investment vehicles and exclude the operating expenses and the impact on non operating income expense and noncontrolling interests of civs 
we believe it is important to provide the consolidated statements of income  excluding consolidated investment vehicles to present the underlying economic performance of our core asset management operations  which does not include the results of the investment funds that we manage but may not own all of the equity invested 
by deconsolidating the civs from the consolidated statements of income  the investment advisory and distribution fees earned by legg mason from civs are added back to reflect our actual revenues 
similarly the operating expenses and the impact on non operating income expense and noncontrolling interests of civs are removed from the gaap basis statements of income since this activity does not actually belong to us 
the deconsolidation of the investment vehicles does not have any impact on net income attributable to legg mason  inc in any period presented

the following tables present a reconciliation of our consolidated statements of income presented on a gaap basis to our consolidated statements of income  excluding consolidated investment vehicles for the years ended march  and for the years ended march  gaap basis civs non gaap basis excluding civs gaap basis civs non gaap basis excluding civs total operating revenues total operating expenses operating income other non operating income expense income loss before income tax provision income tax provision net income loss less net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests net income attributable to legg mason  inc adjusted income as supplemental information  we are providing a performance measure that is based on a methodology other than generally accepted accounting principles non gaap for adjusted income that management uses as a benchmark in evaluating and comparing the period to period operating performance of legg mason  inc and its subsidiaries 
we define adjusted income as net income loss attributable to legg mason  inc plus amortization and deferred taxes related to intangible assets and goodwill  and imputed interest and tax benefits on contingent convertible debt less deferred income taxes on goodwill and indefinite life intangible asset impairment  if any 
we also adjust for non core items that are not reflective of our economic performance  such as impairment charges and the impact of tax rate adjustments on certain deferred tax liabilities related to indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill  and net money market fund support losses gains 
we believe that adjusted income provides a useful representation of our operating performance adjusted for non cash acquisition related items and other items that facilitate comparison of our results to the results of other asset management firms that have not issued contingent convertible debt  made significant acquisitions  or engaged in money market fund support transactions 
we also believe that adjusted income is an important metric in estimating the value of an asset management business 
adjusted income only considers adjustments for certain items that relate to operating performance and comparability  and therefore  is most readily reconcilable to net income determined under gaap 
this measure is provided in addition to net income  but is not a substitute for net income and may not be comparable to non gaap performance measures  including measures of adjusted earnings or adjusted income  of other companies 
further  adjusted income is not a liquidity measure and should not be used in place of cash flow measures determined under gaap 
we consider adjusted income 
table of contents to be useful to investors because it is an important metric in measuring the economic performance of asset management companies  as an indicator of value  and because it facilitates comparison of our operating results with the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in significant acquisitions  issued contingent convertible debt  or engaged in money market fund support transactions 
in calculating adjusted income we add the impact of the amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions  such as management contracts  to net income to reflect the fact that these non cash expenses distort comparisons of our operating results with the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in significant acquisitions 
deferred taxes on indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill include actual tax benefits from amortization deductions that are not realized under gaap absent an impairment charge or the disposition of the related business 
because we fully expect to realize the economic benefit of the current period tax amortization  we add this benefit to net income in the calculation of adjusted income 
however  because of our net operating loss carryforward  we will receive the benefit of the current tax amortization over time 
conversely  we subtract the non cash income tax benefits on goodwill and indefinite life intangible asset impairment charges and uk tax rate adjustments on excess book basis on certain acquired indefinite life intangible assets that have been recognized under gaap 
we also add back imputed interest on contingent convertible debt  which is a non cash expense  as well as the actual tax benefits on the related contingent convertible debt that are not realized under gaap 
we also add subtract other non core items  such as net money market fund support losses gains net of losses on the sale of the underlying structured investment vehicle siv securities  if applicable 
these adjustments reflect that these items distort comparisons of our operating results to prior periods and the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in money market fund support transactions or significant acquisitions  including any related impairments 
should a disposition  impairment charge or other non core item occur  its impact on adjusted income may distort actual changes in the operating performance or value of our firm 
also  realized losses on money market fund support transactions are reflective of changes in the operating performance and value of our firm 
accordingly  we monitor these items and their related impact  including taxes  on adjusted income to ensure that appropriate adjustments and explanations accompany such disclosures 
although depreciation and amortization of fixed assets are non cash expenses  we do not add these charges in calculating adjusted income because these charges are related to assets that will ultimately require replacement

the compensation items  other than transition related costs  are removed from operating income in the calculation because they are offset by an equal amount in other non operating income expense  and thus have no impact on net income 
transition related costs and income loss of civs are removed from operating income in the calculation because these items are not reflective of our core asset management operations 
we use adjusted operating revenues in the calculation to show the operating margin without distribution and servicing expenses  which we use to approximate our distribution revenues that are passed through to third parties as a direct cost of selling our products  although distribution and servicing expenses may include commissions paid in connection with the launching of closed end funds for which there is no corresponding revenue in the period 
adjusted operating revenues also include our advisory revenues we receive from civs that are eliminated in consolidation under gaap 
we believe that operating margin  as adjusted  is a useful measure of our performance because it provides a measure of our core business activities excluding items that have no impact on net income and because it indicates what our operating margin would have been without the distribution revenues that are passed through to third parties as a direct cost of selling our products  transition related costs  and the impact of the consolidation of certain investment vehicles described above

table of contents investment performance investment performance of our assets under management in the year ended march  improved compared to relevant benchmarks from the prior year 
although the unemployment rate remains high  the us economy continued to slowly show signs of recovery 
a strong rebound in corporate earnings  improvements in existing home sales and consumer spending  and stabilization in the financial services industry helped to restore some level of investor confidence 
however  uncertainty in the markets remained  as best evidenced by the may  intraday sell off and subsequent rebound 
with concerns regarding the credit quality of certain european nations  and as government stimulus initiatives continued globally  debates about inflation and deflation loomed 
in the fixed income markets  government yields continued to rise as investors grew concerned about the need to finance the growing federal deficit and demand for government bonds decreased due to investors returning appetite for risk 
most sector spreads declined in as investors returned to riskier securities such as high yield bonds and emerging market debt securities 
investment grade corporate bonds delivered their strongest performance on record with basis points in excess returns over treasuries in for the year period  the treasury yield curve was historically steep as the federal reserve continued to keep federal funds at close to 
the worst performing fixed income sector was government bonds as measured by the barclays us government bond returning  in contrast to high yield bonds which returned for the following table presents a summary of the percentage of our marketed composite assets that outpaced their benchmarks as of march  and  for the trailing year  year  year  and year periods as of march  as of march  year year year year year year year year equity fixed income the following table presents a summary of the percentage of our us mutual fund assets that outpaced their lipper category as of march  and  for the trailing year  year  year  and year periods as of march  as of march  year year year year year year year year total long term equity fixed income revenue by division operating revenues by division in millions for the years ended march were as follows of total of total change americas international total the decrease in operating revenues in the americas division was primarily due to decreased mutual fund advisory fees on assets managed by western asset  lmcm  and clearbridge  decreased separate account advisory fees on assets managed by western asset and clearbridge and decreased distribution and service fee revenues from us retail equity funds 
the decrease in operating revenues in the international division was primarily due to decreased fund revenues at permal

the performance of our us long term mutual fund assets is included in the marketed composites 

table of contents results of operations operating revenues total operating revenues for the year ended march  were billion  down from billion in the prior year primarily as a result of a decrease in average aum 
the shift in the mix of average aum from higher fee equity assets to a greater percentage of liquidity and fixed income assets also contributed to the revenue decline 
investment advisory fees from separate accounts decreased million  or  to million 
of this decrease  million was the result of lower average equity assets at clearbridge  private capital management  lp pcm  lmcm and brandywine  and million was the result of lower average fixed income assets managed at western asset 
investment advisory fees from funds decreased million  or  to billion 
of this decrease  million was the result of lower average equity assets managed primarily at permal  lmcm  and clearbridge  million was the result of fee waivers related to liquidity funds managed by western asset primarily to maintain certain yields to investors  and million was the result of lower average liquidity assets managed at western asset 
performance fees increased  or million  to million during fiscal  driven by fees earned on assets managed at western asset and permal 
distribution and service fees decreased to million  primarily as a result of a decline in average mutual fund aum and the impact of increased fee waivers related to liquidity funds managed by western asset 
operating expenses as a result of substantial declines in revenues during fiscal due to challenging market conditions  actions were taken to reduce our corporate cost structure 
these cost saving measures primarily included reductions in full time employees and discretionary incentive compensation in business support functions  significant reductions in the utilization of consultants for technology projects  and substantial curtailment of promotional costs 
operating expenses in fiscal continued to benefit from the cost reduction initiatives implemented in fiscal  with many of the more significant actions implemented in the december quarter 
the discussion below for each of our operating expenses identifies the amount of variance attributable to cost savings achieved in fiscal  where applicable 
compensation and benefits decreased to billion 
this decrease was driven by a million decrease in revenue share based compensation  primarily resulting from lower revenues in fiscal  the impact of which was offset in part by reductions in other operating expenses at revenue share based affiliates 
the net impact of workforce reductions lowered compensation by approximately million 
these reductions were substantially offset by an increase in deferred compensation and revenue share based incentive obligations of million resulting from market gains on assets invested for deferred compensation plans and seed capital investments  which are offset by gains in other non operating income expense 
compensation as a percentage of operating revenues increased to from in the prior fiscal year primarily as a result of compensation increases related to unrealized market gains on assets invested for deferred compensation plans and investments in proprietary fund products and the impact of fixed compensation costs which do not directly vary with revenues 
distribution and servicing expenses decreased to million  primarily as a result of a decrease in average aum in certain products for which we pay fees to third party distributors and the impact of liquidity fund fee waivers that reduce amounts paid to our distributors 
communications and technology expense decreased to million  primarily as a result of cost savings initiatives that contributed to a million reduction in technology consulting fees  telecommunications and market data services 
reductions in printing costs and lower technology depreciation expense  which resulted from the full depreciation of certain assets prior to or during fiscal  of million and million  respectively  also contributed to the decrease 
occupancy expense decreased to million  primarily due to the recognition of million of lease charges related to office vacancies recorded in the prior year  offset in part by a million charge primarily resulting from the subleasing of space in our corporate headquarters in fiscal amortization of intangible assets decreased to million  primarily due to the impact of intangible asset impairments during fiscal  which reduced amortization expense by million 

table of contents impairment charges were billion in fiscal approximately billion of the total impairment charges related to goodwill and intangible assets in our former wealth management division as a result of significant declines in the aum and projected cash flows within that division 
the remaining million related to certain acquired management contracts  as a result of a more accelerated rate of client attrition  and the impairment of a trade name 
other expenses decreased million to million  primarily as a result of cost savings initiatives that contributed to reductions in travel and entertainment costs of million  and advertising costs of million 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase of million in charges related to the impact of an investor settlement and trading errors 
non operating income expense interest income decreased to million  primarily as a result of a decline in average interest rates and lower average investment balances  which reduced interest income by million and million  respectively 
interest expense decreased to million  primarily as a result of the exchange of our equity units in august  which reduced interest expense by million  and a million decrease due to the repayment of million of the outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility in march  the repayment of our senior notes in july  the repayment of the million outstanding balance on our million term loan in january  as well as lower interest rates paid on this term loan during fiscal these decreases were partially offset by an increase of million in amortization of debt issuance costs  primarily related to the early repayment of our million term loan 
due to increases in the net asset values of previously supported liquidity funds  in fiscal we reversed unrealized  non cash losses recorded in fiscal of million related to liquidity fund support arrangements for our offshore funds that did not involve sivs 
during fiscal  fund support losses were billion  primarily as a result of siv price deterioration and our elimination of siv exposure 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on fund support 
other non operating income expense increased million to income of million  primarily as a result of an increase of million in unrealized market gains on assets invested for deferred compensation plans  which are substantially offset by corresponding compensation increases discussed above  and million in unrealized market gains on investments in proprietary fund products  which are partially offset by corresponding compensation increases discussed above 
these increases were offset in part by the impact of million in charges related to the exchange of substantially all of our equity units in fiscal income tax provision benefit the provision for income taxes was million compared to a benefit of billion in the prior year  primarily as a result of increased earnings due to the absence of losses related to liquidity fund support and goodwill impairment charges 
the effective tax rate was compared to a benefit rate of in the prior year 
the current year rate was beneficially impacted by lower effective tax rates in foreign jurisdictions 
the prior year benefit rate was driven by the impact of the siv related charges with lower state tax benefits and the impact of a non deductible portion of the goodwill impairment charge  offset by tax benefits associated with the restructuring of a foreign subsidiary

liquidity and the access to liquidity is important to the success of our ongoing operations 
our overall funding needs and capital base are continually reviewed to determine if the capital base meets the expected needs of our businesses 
we intend to continue to explore potential acquisition opportunities as a means of diversifying and strengthening our asset management business 
these opportunities may from time to time involve acquisitions that are material in size and may require  among other things  and  subject to existing covenants  the raising of additional equity capital and or the issuance of additional debt 
the consolidation of variable interest entities as of april  under new accounting guidance  as further discussed in critical accounting policies  did not impact our liquidity and capital resources 
we have no rights to the benefits from  nor do we bear the risks associated with  the assets and liabilities of the civs  beyond our investments in and investment advisory fees generated from these vehicles  which are eliminated in consolidation 
additionally  creditors of the civs have no recourse to our general credit beyond the level of our investment  if any  so we do not consider these liabilities to be our obligations 
our assets consist primarily of intangible assets  cash and cash equivalents  goodwill  investment securities  and investment advisory and related fee receivables

cash outflows for investing activities during fiscal were million  primarily attributable to payments made for fixed assets 
cash outflows for financing activities of million  were driven by the repurchase of million of our common shares for million 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
during fiscal  cash flows from operating activities were  million  of which billion reflects the receipt of income tax refunds resulting from net operating loss carrybacks 
the remainder was attributable to net income adjusted for non cash items 
cash outflows for investing activities during fiscal were million  primarily attributable to cash payments of million made in connection with the acquisition of permal  and payments for fixed assets of million  principally associated with the relocation of our corporate headquarters  partially offset by fund support collateral received of million due to the amendment  termination and expiration of certain capital support arrangements 
cash outflows for financing activities were million  primarily due to the repayment in january of the remaining million outstanding balance on our million five year term loan  million of cash consideration paid in the equity units exchange offer and the payment of cash dividends 
during fiscal  cash flows from operations were million  primarily attributable to revenue declines 
cash outflows for investing activities were billion during fiscal  primarily attributable to the purchase of siv securities from our liquidity funds  which used billion 
these outflows were offset in part by proceeds from the sale of securities purchased under agreements to resell and siv securities of billion  cash proceeds received for the sale of the implementation and overlay business of legg mason private portfolio group lmppg of million  and the return of a portion of a contingent earn out payment from the acquisition of pcm of million that was previously funded into escrow 
cash flows from financing activities provided million during fiscal  primarily due to billion in net proceeds from the offering of equity units  offset in part by the repayment of million of senior notes and a million repayment on our million unsecured revolving credit facility 
financing transactions the table below reflects our primary sources of financing in thousands as of march  amount outstanding at march  total at march  type interest rate maturity convertible senior notes    january senior notes from equity units    june revolving credit agreement    libor february 
table of contents during january  we increased our capital base by billion through the sale of convertible senior notes 
the proceeds strengthened our balance sheet and provided additional liquidity that has been used for general corporate purposes  including the purchase of siv securities from our liquidity funds 
the senior notes bear interest at  payable semi annually in cash 
we are accreting the carrying value to the principal amount at maturity using an imputed interest rate of the effective borrowing rate for non convertible debt at the time of issuance over its expected life of seven years  resulting in additional interest expense for fiscal and of approximately million and million  respectively 
in connection with this financing  we entered into economic hedging transactions that increase the effective conversion price of the notes 
these hedging transactions had a net cost to us of million  which we paid from the proceeds of the notes 
these transactions closed on january  in may  we issued million equity units for billion  of which million was used to pay issuance costs 
each unit consists of a interest in  principal amount of senior notes due june  and a purchase contract to purchase a varying number of shares of our common stock by june  the notes and purchase contracts are separate and distinct instruments  but their terms are structured to simulate a conversion of debt to equity and potentially remarketed debt approximately three years after issuance 
during the september quarter  we completed an exchange offer for our equity units in the form of corporate units in order to increase our equity capital levels and reduce the amount of our outstanding debt and related interest expense 
we exchanged of our outstanding corporate units  each for of a share of our common stock and in cash per corporate unit  equating to million shares of legg mason common stock and million of cash  including cash paid in lieu of fractional shares and transaction costs 
in connection with this transaction  we incurred transaction costs of approximately million  of which million was in cash 
approximately million equity units with million of senior notes remain outstanding 
we are in the process of evaluating our options for remarketing the senior notes by june  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
during november  we borrowed an aggregate of million under our unsecured revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes 
in march  we repaid million of the outstanding borrowings under this credit facility 
the facility may be prepaid at any time and contains customary covenants and default provisions 
the facility was scheduled to mature on october   however  in fiscal  the credit agreement was amended to extend the maturity date to february  and modify covenants  as discussed below 
in october  we borrowed million through a syndicated five year unsecured floating rate term loan agreement to primarily fund the cash portion of the purchase price of the citigroup transaction 
during fiscal  we repaid the remaining million outstanding balance of the debt 
the agreements entered into as part of our january issuance of billion in convertible senior notes prevent us from incurring additional debt  with a few exceptions  if our debt to ebitda ratio as defined in the documents exceeds in order to complete the may issuance of the equity units  we received a waiver of the covenant under which we are prevented from issuing more than million in additional debt at any time when our debt to ebitda ratio exceeds upon expiration of this waiver on june   we will be unable to incur any additional debt if our debt to ebitda ratio exceeds as of march   our debt to ebitda ratio was and thus the only new debt we could have incurred would be allowed by the covenant exceptions 
at march   our financial covenants under our bank agreements include maximum net debt to ebitda ratio of and minimum ebitda to interest expense ratio of debt is defined to include all obligations for borrowed money  excluding the debt incurred in the equity units offering and non recourse debt  and under capital leases 
under these net debt covenants  our debt is reduced by the amount of our unrestricted cash in excess of the greater of subsidiary cash or million 
ebitda is defined as consolidated net income plus minus tax expense  interest expense  depreciation and amortization  amortization of intangibles  any extraordinary expenses or losses  and any non cash charges  as defined 
as of march   our net debt to ebitda ratio was and ebitda to interest expense ratio was we have maintained compliance with our covenants at all times during fiscal if our net income significantly declines  or if we spend our available cash  it may impact our ability to maintain compliance with these covenants 
if we determine that our compliance with these covenants may be under pressure  
table of contents we may elect to take a number of actions  including reducing our expenses in order to increase our ebitda  using available cash to repay all or a portion of our million outstanding debt subject to these covenants or seeking to negotiate with our lenders to modify the terms or to restructure our debt 
we anticipate that we will have available cash to repay our bank debt  should it be necessary 
using available cash to repay indebtedness would make the cash unavailable for other uses and might affect the liquidity discussions and conclusions above 
entering into any modification or restructuring of our debt would likely result in additional fees or interest payments 
our outstanding debt is currently impacted by the ratings of two rating agencies 
in the event of a downgrade by both rating agencies  the interest rate on our revolving line of credit may increase 
other transactions during fiscal  in connection with the acquisition of permal  we paid an aggregate of million in cash to acquire the remaining of the outstanding preference shares 
we also elected to purchase  for million  the rights of the sellers of the preference shares to receive an earnout payment of up to million in two years 
as a result of this transaction  there will be no further payments for the permal acquisition 
in addition  during fiscal and  we paid an aggregate amount of million in dividends on the preference shares 
all payments for preference shares  including dividends  were recognized as additional goodwill 
during fiscal  we announced a plan to terminate the exchangeable share arrangement related to the acquisition of legg mason canada inc  in accordance with its terms 
in may  million shares  representing all remaining outstanding exchangeable shares  were exchanged for shares of our common stock 
during fiscal  in connection with the acquisition of pcm  we paid into escrow the maximum fifth anniversary payment of million of which million remained in escrow subject to certain limited claw back provisions until july during fiscal  the contingency was settled at which time million was released from escrow to the sellers and million was returned to us and recorded as a reduction of goodwill 
in april  we completed a sale in which citigroup global markets inc  an affiliate of citigroup  acquired a majority of the overlay and implementation business of lmppg  including its managed account trading and technology platform 
the sale produced cash proceeds of approximately million 
certain of our asset management affiliates maintain various credit facilities for general operating purposes 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
certain affiliates are also subject to the capital requirements of various regulatory agencies 
all such affiliates met their respective capital adequacy requirements 
liquidity fund support during fiscal  we had arrangements to provide financial support to certain liquidity funds 
during fiscal  we purchased and subsequently sold  or reimbursed the funds for a portion of their losses incurred in selling  all outstanding securities issued by sivs held in various liquidity funds managed by one of our affiliates  the majority of which were previously supported under these arrangements 
during fiscal  we also sold canadian conduit securities purchased from one of our liquidity funds during fiscal in fiscal  we provided additional support to liquidity funds that was not related to siv securities 
as of march  all support arrangements were terminated or expired 
during fiscal  we paid billion for an aggregate billion in principal amount plus million of accrued interest of non bank sponsored siv securities from certain liquidity funds that were previously supported under various capital support agreements csas and letters of credit locs 
upon the purchase of these securities  the csas and locs were terminated in accordance with their terms 
collateral of billion was returned  which included the return of billion of collateral provided during fiscal to support new or amended csas and locs 
during fiscal  the billion of purchased securities were sold along with million of securities previously supported by a total return swap trs and million of canadian conduit securities held on our balance sheet  to third parties for million  net of transaction costs 
the trs terminated in accordance with its terms upon the sale of the securities and million of collateral was returned 
during fiscal  we also paid million to reimburse two funds for a portion of losses they incurred in selling siv securities 
during fiscal  the four remaining csas to provide up to million in support to two liquidity funds were 
table of contents terminated or expired in accordance with their terms 
no amounts were drawn thereunder and million of collateral was returned 
future outlook we expect that over the next months our operating activities will be adequate to support our operating cash needs 
in addition to our ordinary operating cash needs  as described above  we anticipate other cash needs during the next months 
in connection with the announced plan to streamline our business model  we expect to incur transition related costs in the range of million to million through march  of which approximately are non cash charges 
during fiscal  million of these costs were accrued and substantially all of the remaining costs will be accrued in fiscal a significant portion of the accrued costs will be paid in fiscal we project that the initiative will result in annual cost savings of approximately million to million  excluding costs to achieve these savings  and expect to achieve these savings on a run rate basis by the fourth quarter of fiscal see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding transition related costs recorded in fiscal we currently intend to utilize our other available resources for any number of potential activities  including seed capital investments in new products  repurchase of shares of our common stock  as further discussed below  repayment of outstanding debt  payment of increased dividends  or acquisitions 
as described above  we currently project that our available cash and cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to fund our iquidity needs 
we also currently have approximately billion in cash in excess of our working capital requirements  a portion of which we intend to utilize to repurchase up to million of our common stock by the end of fiscal  subject to market conditions and our performance  actual cash flows  and other capital needs 
these repurchases will be made under the current board of directors authorization to repurchase up to billion of our common stock  announced in may  of which million remains unused as of march  accordingly  we do not currently expect to raise additional debt or equity financing over the next months 
however  there can be no assurances of these expectations as our projections could prove to be incorrect  unexpected events may occur that require additional liquidity  such as an acquisition opportunity or an opportunity to refinance indebtedness  or market conditions might significantly worsen  affecting our results of operations and generation of available cash 
if these events resulted in our operations and available cash being insufficient to fund liquidity needs  we would likely seek to manage our available resources by taking actions such as reducing future share repurchases  additional cost cutting  reducing our expected expenditures on investments  selling assets such as investment securities  repatriating earnings from foreign affiliates  or modifying arrangements with our affiliates and or employees 
should these types of actions prove insufficient  or should a large acquisition or refinancing opportunity arise  we may seek to raise additional equity or debt 
credit and liquidity risk cash and cash equivalent deposits involve certain credit and liquidity risks 
we maintain our cash and cash equivalents with a limited number of high quality financial institutions and from time to time may have concentrations with one or more of these institutions 
the balances with these financial institutions and their credit quality are monitored on an ongoing basis 
off balance sheet arrangements off balance sheet arrangements  as defined by the securities and exchange commission sec  include certain contractual arrangements pursuant to which a company has an obligation  such as certain contingent obligations  certain guarantee contracts  retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity  certain derivative instruments classified as equity or material variable interests in unconsolidated entities that provide financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support 
disclosure is required for any off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a material current or future effect on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity or capital resources 
we generally do not enter into off balance sheet arrangements  as defined  other than those described in the contractual obligations section that follows and consolidation and liquidity fund support discussed in critical accounting policies and notes  and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as previously discussed  during fiscal we had various off balance sheet arrangements to provide support to certain of our liquidity funds 
these arrangements  all of which were terminated or expired prior to march   included letters of credit  capital support agreements and a trs 

table of contents in january  we entered into hedge and warrant transactions on the convertible notes with certain financial institution counterparties to increase the effective conversion price of the convertible senior notes 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
contractual and contingent obligations we have contractual obligations to make future payments  principally in connection with our long term debt and non cancelable lease agreements 
see notes   and of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures related to our commitments 
the following table sets forth these contractual obligations in millions by fiscal year thereafter total contractual obligations short term borrowings long term borrowings by contract maturity interest on short term and long term borrowings minimum rental and service commitments total contractual obligations represents borrowing under our revolving line of credit which does not expire until february however  we may elect to repay this debt sooner if management elects to utilize a portion of our available cash for this purpose 
excludes long term borrowings of the consolidated clo of million and interest on these long term borrowings  as applicable 
the amount in thereafter is contractually due fiscal  subject to potential remarketing as further described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest on floating rate short term debt is based on rates at march  in connection with our restructuring plans  we no longer intend to exercise a put purchase option on land and a building that was treated as a capital lease 
the remaining rental commitment for this facility is included in minimum rental and service commitments above 
the table above does not include approximately million in capital commitments to investment partnerships in which legg mason is a limited partner 
these obligations will be funded  as required  through the end of the commitment periods through fiscal the table above does not include amounts for uncertain tax positions of million net of the federal benefit for state tax liabilities because the timing of any related cash outflows cannot be reliably estimated 
the table above does not include amounts related to our business streamlining initiatives 

table of contents market risk the company maintains an enterprise risk management program to oversee and coordinate risk management activities of legg mason and its subsidiaries 
under the program  certain risk activities are managed at the subsidiary level 
the following describes certain aspects of our business that are sensitive to market risk 
revenues and net income the majority of our revenue is calculated from the market value of our aum 
accordingly  a decline in the value of securities will cause our aum to decrease 
in addition  our fixed income and liquidity aum are subject to the impact of interest rate fluctuations  as rising interest rates may tend to reduce the market value of bonds held in various mutual fund portfolios or separately managed accounts 
in the ordinary course of our business we may also reduce or waive investment management fees  or limit total expenses  on certain products or services for particular time periods to manage fund expenses  or for other reasons  and to help retain or increase managed assets 
performance fees may be earned on certain investment advisory contracts for exceeding performance benchmarks 
declines in market values of aum will result in reduced fee revenues and net income 
we generally earn higher fees on equity assets than fees charged for fixed income and liquidity assets 
declines in market values of aum in this asset class will disproportionately impact our revenues 
in addition  under revenue sharing agreements  certain of our affiliates retain different percentages of revenues to cover their costs  including compensation 
our net income  profit margin and compensation as a percentage of operating revenues are impacted based on which affiliates generate our revenues  and a change in aum at one subsidiary can have a dramatically different effect on our revenues and earnings than an equal change at another subsidiary 
trading and non trading assets our trading and non trading assets are comprised of investment securities  including seed capital in sponsored mutual funds and products  limited partnerships  limited liability companies and certain other investment products 
trading and other current investments  excluding civs  at march  and subject to risk of security price fluctuations are summarized in thousands below 
investment securities  excluding civs trading investments relating to long term incentive compensation plans trading proprietary fund products and other investments equity method investments relating to long term incentive compensation plans  proprietary fund products and other investments total trading and other current investments  excluding civs approximately million and million of trading and other current investments related to long term incentive compensation plans as of march  and  respectively  have offsetting liabilities such that fluctuation in the market value of these assets and the related liabilities will not have a material effect on our net income or liquidity 
however  it will have an impact on our compensation expense with a corresponding offset in other non operating income expense 
trading and other current investments of million and million at march  and  respectively  relate to other long term incentive plans for which the related liabilities do not completely offset due to vesting provisions 
therefore  fluctuations in the market value of these trading investments will impact our compensation expense  non operating income and net income 
approximately million and million of trading and other current investments at march  and  respectively  are investments in proprietary fund products and other investments for which fluctuations in market value will impact our non operating income 
of these amounts  the fluctuations in market value of approximately million and million of proprietary fund products as of march  and  respectively  have offsetting compensation expense under revenue share agreements 
the fluctuations in market value of approximately and million in proprietary fund products as of march  and  respectively  are substantially offset by gains losses on market hedges and therefore do not materially impact net income attributable to legg mason  inc investments in proprietary fund products are not liquidated until the related fund establishes a track record  has other investors  or a decision is made to no longer pursue the strategy

investment securities  excluding civs available for sale investments in partnerships and llcs equity method investments in partnerships  llcs  and other other investments total non trading assets  excluding civs equity method investments in partnerships and llcs at march  and includes approximately million and million  respectively  of investments related to our involvement with the us treasury public private investment program ppip 
investment securities of civs totaled million and million as of march  and  respectively  and investments of civs totaled million and million as of march  and  respectively 
as of march  and  we held equity investments in the civs of million and million  respectively 
fluctuations in the market value of investments of civs in excess of our equity investment will not impact net income attributable to legg mason  inc however  it may have an impact on other non operating income expense of civs with a corresponding offset in net income loss attributable to non controlling interests 
valuation of trading and non trading investments is described below within critical accounting policies under the heading valuation of financial instruments

the following is a summary of the effect of a increase or decrease in the market values of our financial instruments subject to market valuation risks at march  carrying value fair value assuming a increase fair value assuming a decrease investment securities  excluding civs trading investments related to deferred compensation plans trading proprietary fund products and other equity method investments relating to deferred compensation plans  proprietary fund products and other investments total current investments  excluding civs net investments in civs available for sale investments investments in partnerships and llcs equity method investments in partnerships  llcs  and other other investments total investments subject to market risk gains and losses related to certain investments in deferred compensation plans and proprietary fund products are directly offset by a corresponding adjustment to compensation expense and related liability 
in addition  investments in proprietary fund products of approximately million have been hedged to limit market risk 
as a result  a increase or decrease in the unrealized market value of our financial instruments subject to market valuation risks would result in a million increase or decrease in our pre tax earnings as of march  
table of contents foreign exchange sensitivity we operate primarily in the united states  but provide services  earn revenues and incur expenses outside the united states 
accordingly  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates for currencies  principally in brazil  japan  the united kingdom  singapore  and australia  may impact our comprehensive income and net income 
certain of our affiliates have entered into forward contracts to manage the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on their results of operations 
we do not expect foreign currency fluctuations to have a material effect on our net income or liquidity 
interest rate risk exposure to interest rate changes on our outstanding debt is mitigated as a substantial portion of our debt is at fixed interest rates 
at march  and  approximately million and million  respectively  of our outstanding floating rate debt is subject to fluctuations in interest rates and will have an impact on our non operating income and net income 
as of march   we estimate that a change in interest rates would result in a net annual change to interest expense of million

critical accounting policies and estimates accounting policies are an integral part of the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
understanding these policies  therefore  is a key factor in understanding our reported results of operations and financial position 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our significant accounting policies and other information 
certain critical accounting policies require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses reported in the financial statements 
due to their nature  estimates involve judgment based upon available information 
therefore  actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the difference could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
we consider the following to be our critical accounting policies that involve significant estimates or judgments

 relating to the consolidation of variable interest entities vies which includes a new approach for determining who should consolidate a vie  changes to when it is necessary to reassess who should consolidate a vie  and changes in the assessment of which entities are vies 
the application of the new accounting guidance has been deferred for certain investment funds  including money market funds 
investment funds that qualify for the deferral continue to be assessed for consolidation under prior guidance  financial accounting standards board interpretation no

in the normal course of our business  we sponsor and are the manager of various types of investment vehicles 
certain of these investment vehicles are considered to be vies while others are considered to be voting rights entities vres subject to traditional consolidation concepts based on ownership rights 
for our services  we are entitled to receive management fees and may be eligible  under certain circumstances  to receive additional subordinate management fees or other incentive fees 
our exposure to risk in these entities is generally limited to any equity investment we have made or are required to make and any earned but uncollected management fees 
uncollected management fees from these vies were not material at march  we have not issued any investment performance guarantees to these vies  vres or their investors 
investment vehicles that are considered vres are consolidated if we have a controlling financial interest in the investment vehicle 
fin r for sponsored investment funds  including money market funds  which qualify for the deferral of new accounting guidance  we determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of a vie if we absorb a majority of the vie expected losses  or receive a majority of the vie expected residual returns  if any 
our determination of expected residual returns excludes gross fees paid to a decision maker 
it is unlikely that we will be the primary beneficiary for vies created to manage assets for clients which qualify for the deferral unless our ownership interest  including interests of related parties  is 
table of contents substantial  unless we may earn significant performance fees from the vie or unless we are considered to have a material implied variable interest in the vie 
in determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of a vie which qualifies for the deferral  we consider both qualitative and quantitative factors such as the voting rights of the equity holders  economic participation of all parties  including how fees are earned and paid to us  related party ownership  guarantees and implied relationships 
in determining the primary beneficiary  we must make assumptions and estimates about  among other things  the future performance of the underlying assets held by the vie  including investment returns  cash flows  and credit and interest rate risks 
in determining whether a vie is significant for disclosure purposes  we consider the same factors used for determination of the primary beneficiary 
sfas no 
we sponsor and are the manager for collateralized debt obligation entities cdos and clos that do not qualify for the deferral  and are assessed under the new accounting guidance  as follows 
we determine whether we have a variable interest in a vie by considering if  among other things  we have the obligation to absorb losses  or the right to receive benefits  that are expected to be significant to the vie 
we consider the management fee structure  including the seniority level of our fees  the current and expected economic performance of the entity  as well as other provisions included in the governing documents that might restrict or guarantee an expected loss or residual return 
if we have a significant variable interest  we determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of the vie if we have both the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the entity economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses  or the right to receive benefits  that could potentially be significant to the vie 
in evaluating whether we have the obligation to absorb losses  or the right to receive benefits  that could potentially be significant to the vie  we consider factors regarding the design  terms  and characteristics of the investment vehicles  including the following qualitative factors if we have involvement with the investment vehicle beyond providing management services  if we hold equity or debt interests in the investment vehicle  if we have transferred any assets to the investment vehicle  if the potential aggregate fees in future periods are insignificant relative to the potential cash flows of the investment vehicle  and if the variability of the expected fees in relation to the potential cash flows of the investment vehicle is insignificant 
under both the new accounting guidance and prior guidance  legg mason must consolidate vies for which it is deemed to be the primary beneficiary 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of civs and other vies 
revenue recognition the vast majority of our revenues are calculated as a percentage of the fair value of our aum 
the underlying securities within the portfolios we manage  which are not reflected within our consolidated financial statements  are generally valued as follows i with respect to securities for which market quotations are readily available  the market value of such securities  and ii with respect to other securities and assets  fair value as determined in good faith 
for most of our mutual funds and other pooled products  the boards of directors or similar bodies are responsible for establishing policies and procedures related to the pricing of securities 
each board of directors generally delegates the execution of the various functions related to pricing to a fund valuation committee which  in turn  may rely on information from various parties in pricing securities such as independent pricing services  the fund accounting agent  the fund manager  broker dealers  and others or a combination thereof 
the funds have controls reasonably designed to ensure that the prices assigned to securities they hold are accurate 
management has established policies to ensure consistency in the application of revenue recognition 
as manager and advisor for separate accounts  we are generally responsible for the pricing of securities held in client accounts or may share this responsibility with others and have established policies to govern valuation processes similar to those discussed above for mutual funds that are reasonably designed to ensure consistency in the application of revenue recognition 
management relies extensively on the data provided by independent pricing services and the custodians in the pricing of separate account aum 
separate account customers typically select the custodian 
valuation processes for aum are dependent on the nature of the assets and any contractual provisions with our clients 
equity securities under management for which market quotations are available are usually valued at the 
table of contents last reported sales price or official closing price on the primary market or exchange on which they trade 
debt securities under management are usually valued at bid  or the mean between the last quoted bid and asked prices  provided by independent pricing services that are based on transactions in debt obligations  quotations from bond dealers  market transactions in comparable securities and various other relationships between securities 
short term debt obligations are generally valued at amortized cost  which is designed to approximate fair value 
the vast majority of our aum is valued based on data from third parties such as independent pricing services  fund accounting agents  custodians and brokers 
this varies slightly from time to time based upon the underlying composition of the asset class equity  fixed income and liquidity as well as the actual underlying securities in the portfolio within each asset class 
regardless of the valuation process or pricing source  we have established controls reasonably designed to assess the reasonableness of the prices provided 
where market prices are not readily available  or are determined not to reflect fair value  value may be determined in accordance with established valuation procedures based on  among other things  unobservable inputs 
management fees on aum where fair values are based on unobservable inputs are not material 
as of march   equity  fixed income and liquidity aum values aggregated billion  billion  and billion  respectively 
as the vast majority of our aum is valued by independent pricing services based upon observable market prices or inputs  we believe market risk is the most significant risk underlying valuation of our aum 
economic events and financial market turmoil have increased market price volatility  however  the valuation of the vast majority of the securities held by our funds and in separate accounts continues to be derived from readily available market price quotations 
as of march   less than of total aum is valued based on unobservable inputs 
valuation of financial instruments substantially all financial instruments are reflected in the financial statements at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value  except legg mason long term debt 
trading investments  investment securities and derivative assets and liabilities included in the consolidated balance sheets include forms of financial instruments 
unrealized gains and losses related to these financial instruments are reflected in net income or other comprehensive income  depending on the underlying purpose of the instrument 
for equity investments where we do not control the investee  and where we are not the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity  but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee  we follow the equity method of accounting 
the evaluation of whether we exert control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment 
factors considered in these evaluations may include investor voting or other rights  any influence we may have on the governing board of the investee  the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the fund operating documents and the relationship between us and other investors in the entity 
substantially all of our equity method investees are investment companies which record their underlying investments at fair value 
therefore  under the equity method of accounting  our share of the investee underlying net income or loss predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investee 
our share of the investee net income or loss is based on the most current information available and is recorded as a net gain loss on investments within non operating income expense 
for investments  we value equity and fixed income securities using closing market prices for listed instruments or broker or dealer price quotations  when available 
fixed income securities may also be valued using valuation models and estimates based on spreads to actively traded benchmark debt instruments with readily available market prices 
we evaluate our non trading investment securities for other than temporary impairment 
impairment may exist when the fair value of an investment security has been below the adjusted cost for an extended period of time 
if an other than temporary impairment is determined to exist  the difference between the adjusted cost of the investment security and its current fair value is recognized as a charge to earnings in the period in which the impairment is determined 
in fiscal  we had in place various credit support arrangements for certain liquidity funds managed by a subsidiary that qualified as derivative transactions 
the fair values of these derivative instruments were based on management estimates of expected outcomes derived from pricing data for the underlying securities and or detailed collateral analyses 
during fiscal  we purchased and subsequently sold all supported securities issued by sivs held in our liquidity funds  effectively 
table of contents eliminating our exposure to sivs  and the various support arrangements terminated in accordance with their terms upon the purchase 
as of march   four capital support arrangements  which supported investments in non asset backed securities  remained outstanding 
during fiscal  these four remaining capital support arrangements were terminated or expired in accordance with their terms and previously recorded unrealized losses of million were recovered 
none of these derivative transactions were designated for hedge accounting as defined in accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and the related gains and losses are included in fund support in the consolidated statement of operations in fiscal and for investments in illiquid or privately held securities for which market prices or quotations are not readily available  the determination of fair value requires us to estimate the value of the securities using a variety of methods and resources  including the most current available financial information for the investment and the industry 
as of march  and  excluding investments in civs  we owned approximately million and million  respectively  of financial investments that were valued on our assumptions or estimates and unobservable inputs 
at march  and  we also have approximately million and million  respectively  of other investments  such as investment partnerships  that are included in other noncurrent assets on the consolidated balance sheets  of which approximately million and million  respectively  are accounted for under the equity method 
the remainder is accounted for under the cost method 
in addition  as of march  and  we had million and million  respectively  of equity method investments that are included in investment securities on the consolidated balance sheets 
the accounting guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures defines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value 
the accounting guidance defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
a fair value measurement should reflect all of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability  including assumptions about the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique  the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset  and the risk of non performance 
the accounting guidance for fair value measurements establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs for valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs 
our financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories level financial instruments for which prices are quoted in active markets  which  for us  include investments in publicly traded mutual funds with quoted market prices and equities listed in active markets 
level financial instruments for which prices are quoted for similar assets and liabilities in active markets  prices are quoted for identical or similar assets in inactive markets  or prices are based on observable inputs  other than quoted prices  such as models or other valuation methodologies 
for us  this category may include repurchase agreements  fixed income securities and certain proprietary fund products 
this category also includes clo loans and liabilities of a civ 
level financial instruments for which values are based on unobservable inputs  including those for which there is little or no market activity 
this category includes derivative assets and liabilities related to investments in partnerships  limited liability companies  and private equity funds 
previously  this category included derivative assets related to fund support agreements and certain owned securities issued by sivs 
this category may also include certain proprietary fund products with redemption restrictions and clo debt of a civ 
the valuation of an asset or liability may involve inputs from more than one level of the hierarchy 
the level in the fair value hierarchy within which a fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
proprietary fund products and certain investments held by civs are valued at nav determined by the fund administrator 
these funds are typically invested in exchange traded investments with observable market 
table of contents prices 
their valuations may be classified as level  level or level based on whether the fund is exchange traded  the frequency of the related nav determinations and the impact of redemption restrictions 
for investments in illiquid and privately held securities private equity and investment partnerships for which market prices or quotations may not be readily available  including certain investments held by civs  management must estimate the value of the securities using a variety of methods and resources  including the most current available financial information for the investment and the industry to which it applies in order to determine fair value 
these valuation processes for illiquid and privately held securities inherently require management judgment and are therefore classified in level the fair values of clo loans and bonds are determined based on prices from well recognized third party pricing services that utilize available market data and are therefore classified as level legg mason has established controls designed to assess the reasonableness of the prices provided 
the fair value of clo debt is valued using a discounted cash flow methodology 
inputs used to determine the expected cash flows include assumptions about forecasted default and recovery rates that a market participant would use in determining the fair value of the clo underlying collateral assets 
given the significance of the unobservable inputs to the fair value measurement  the clo debt valuation is classified as level exchange traded options are valued using the last sale price or in the absence of a sale  the last offering price 
options traded over the counter are valued using dealer supplied valuations 
options are classified as level futures contracts are valued at the last settlement price at the end of each day on the exchange upon which they are traded and are classified as level index and single name credit default swaps and interest rate swaps are valued based on valuations furnished by pricing services and are classified as level as a practical expedient  we rely on the navs of certain investments as their fair value 
the navs that have been provided by investees are derived from the fair values of the underlying investments as of the reporting date 
as of march   approximately of total assets of financial assets measured at fair value and of total liabilities meet the definition of level excluding the assets and liabilities of civs  approximately of total assets of financial assets measured at fair value and no liabilities meet the definition of level any transfers between categories are measured at the beginning of the period 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
intangible assets and goodwill balances as of march  are as follows americas international total asset management contracts indefinite life intangible assets trade names goodwill our identifiable intangible assets consist primarily of asset management contracts  contracts to manage proprietary mutual funds or funds of hedge funds and trade names resulting from acquisitions 
asset management contracts are amortizable intangible assets that are capitalized at acquisition and amortized over the expected life of the contract 
contracts to manage proprietary mutual funds or funds of hedge funds are indefinite life intangible assets because we assume that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost 
similarly  trade names are considered indefinite life intangible assets because they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely 

table of contents in allocating the purchase price of an acquisition to intangible assets  we must determine the fair value of the assets acquired 
we determine fair values of intangible assets acquired based upon projected future cash flows  which take into consideration estimates and assumptions including profit margins  growth or attrition rates for acquired contracts based upon historical experience  estimated contract lives  discount rates  projected net client flows and market performance 
the determination of estimated contract lives requires judgment based upon historical client turnover and attrition rates and the probability that contracts with termination provisions will be renewed 
the discount rate employed is a weighted average cost of capital that takes into consideration a premium representing the degree of risk inherent in the asset as more fully described below 
for indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill  we project the impact of both net client flows and market appreciation depreciation on cash flows for the near term generally the first five years based on a year by year assessment that considers current market conditions  our past experience  relevant publicly available statistics and projections  internal budgets  and discussions with our own market experts 
beyond five years  our projections for net client flows and market performance migrate towards relevant long term rates in line with our own results and industry growth statistics 
we believe our growth assumptions are reasonable given our consideration of multiple inputs  including internal and external sources described above 
however  there continues to be uncertainty in the markets  and our assumptions are subject to change based on fluctuations in our actual results and market conditions 
goodwill represents the residual amount of acquisition cost in excess of identified tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities 
given the relative significance of our intangible assets and goodwill to our consolidated financial statements  on a quarterly basis we consider if triggering events have occurred that may indicate a significant change in fair values 
triggering events may include significant adverse changes in our business  legal or regulatory environment  loss of key personnel  significant business dispositions  or other events 
if a triggering event has occurred  we perform tests  which include critical reviews of all significant assumptions  to determine if any intangible assets or goodwill are impaired 
at a minimum  we perform these tests for indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill annually at december we completed our annual impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets as of december   and determined that there was no impairment in the value of these assets as of december  further  no impairment in the value of amortizable intangible assets was recognized during the year ended march   as our estimates of the related future cash flows exceeded the asset carrying values 
we have also determined that no triggering events have occurred as of march   therefore  no additional indefinite life intangible asset and goodwill impairment testing was necessary 
amortizable intangible assets intangible assets subject to amortization are considered for impairment at each reporting period using an undiscounted cash flow analysis 
significant assumptions used in assessing the recoverability of management contract intangible assets include projected cash flows generated by the contracts and the remaining lives of the contracts 
projected cash flows are based on fees generated by current aum for the applicable contracts 
contracts are generally assumed to turnover evenly throughout the life of the intangible asset 
the remaining life of the asset is based upon factors such as average client retention and client turnover rates 
if the amortization periods are not appropriate  the expected lives are adjusted and the impact on the fair value is assessed 
actual cash flows in any one period may vary from the projected cash flows without resulting in an impairment charge because a variance in any one period must be considered in conjunction with other assumptions that impact projected cash flows 
the estimated useful lives of amortizable intangible assets currently range from to years with a weighted average life of approximately years 
indefinite life intangible assets for intangible assets with lives that are indeterminable or indefinite  fair value is determined from a market participant perspective based on projected discounted cash flows 
we have two primary types of indefinite life intangible assets proprietary fund contracts and  to a lesser extent  trade names 
we determine the fair value of our intangible assets based upon discounted projected cash flows  which take into consideration estimates of profit margins  growth rates and discount rates 
an asset is determined to be impaired if the current implied fair value is less than the recorded carrying value of the asset 
if an asset is impaired  the difference between the current implied fair value and the 
table of contents carrying value of the asset reflected on the financial statements is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined to be other than temporary 
projected cash flows are based on annualized cash flows for the applicable contracts projected forward years  assuming annual cash flow growth from estimated net client flows and projected market performance 
contracts that are managed and operated as a single unit  such as contracts within the same family of funds  are reviewed in aggregate and are considered interchangeable because investors can transfer between funds with limited restrictions 
similarly  cash flows generated by new funds added to the fund group are included when determining the fair value of the intangible asset 
actual cash flows in any one period may vary from the projected cash flows without resulting in an impairment charge because a variance in any one period must be considered in conjunction with other assumptions that impact projected cash flows 
the domestic mutual fund contracts acquired in the citigroup asset management cam acquisition of  million and the permal funds of hedge funds contracts of million account for approximately and  respectively  of our indefinite life intangible assets 
for our december  annual impairment test  cash flows from the domestic mutual fund contracts were assumed to have annual growth rates that average approximately 
cash flows on the permal contracts were assumed to have annual growth rates that average approximately 
the projected cash flows from the domestic mutual fund and permal funds were discounted at and  respectively 
assuming all other factors remain the same  actual results and changes in assumptions for the domestic mutual fund and permal fund of hedge funds contracts would have to cause our cash flow projections over the long term to deviate more than and  respectively  from previous projections or the discount rate would have to be raised to and  respectively  for the asset to be deemed impaired 
the approximate fair values of these assets exceed their carrying values by million and million  respectively 
trade names account for of indefinite life intangible assets and are primarily related to permal 
we tested these intangible assets using assumptions similar to those described above for indefinite life contracts 
goodwill goodwill is evaluated at the reporting unit level and is considered for impairment when the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the reporting unit 
in estimating the implied fair value of the reporting unit  we use valuation techniques based on discounted projected cash flows  similar to techniques employed in analyzing the purchase price of an acquisition target 
we have defined the reporting units to be the americas and international divisions  which are the same as our operating segments 
allocations of goodwill to our divisions for any changes in our management structure  acquisitions and dispositions are based on relative fair values of the businesses added to or sold from the divisions 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information related to business segments 
significant assumptions used in assessing the implied fair value of the reporting unit under the discounted cash flow method include the projected cash flows generated by the reporting unit  including profit margins  expected cash flow growth rates  and the discount rate used to determine the present value of the cash flows 
cash flow growth rates consider estimates of both aum flows and market expectations by asset class equity  fixed income and liquidity  by investment manager and by reporting unit based upon  among other things  historical experience and expectations of future market performance from internal and external sources 
the impact of both net client flows and market performance on cash flows are projected for the near term generally the first five years based on a year by year assessment that considers current market conditions  our experience  our internal financial projections  relevant publicly available statistics and projections  and discussions with our own market experts 
actual cash flows in any one period may vary from the projected cash flows without resulting in an impairment charge because a variance in any one period must be considered in conjunction with other assumptions that impact projected cash flows 
discount rates are based on appropriately weighted estimated costs of debt and capital using a market participant perspective 
we estimate the cost of debt based on published debt rates 
we estimate the cost of capital based on the capital asset pricing model  which considers the risk free interest rate  market risk and size premiums  peer group betas and unsystematic risk 
the discount rates are also calibrated based on an assessment of relevant market values 

table of contents goodwill in the americas reporting unit principally originated from the acquisitions of cam and royce 
the value of this reporting unit is based on projected net cash flows of assets managed in our us mutual funds  closed end funds and other proprietary funds  in addition to separate account assets of our us managers 
goodwill in the international reporting unit principally originated from the acquisitions of permal and the international cam businesses 
for our december  annual impairment test  the projected cash flows were discounted at and  respectively  for the americas and international divisions to determine the present value of cash flows 
as of december   the implied fair values materially exceeded the carrying values for both the americas and international divisions 
projected cash flows  on an aggregate basis across all asset classes in the americas division  were assumed to have a five year average annual growth rate of approximately  with a long term annual growth rate of approximately 
projected cash flows  on an aggregate basis across all asset classes in the international division were assumed to have a five year average annual growth rate of approximately  with a long term annual growth rate of approximately 
cash flow growth for the americas and international divisions over the next five years was based on separate factors for equity  fixed income  and liquidity products 
equity product growth projections were based on historical trends  in context with our long term growth experience  budgets  and current market conditions 
fixed income product growth projections were based on the past experience of our primary fixed income manager  budgets  and market influences relevant to their business 
long term growth is based on our historical experience  available historic market statistics  and estimates of future expectations 
we believe our growth assumptions are reasonable given our consideration of multiple inputs  including internal and external sources described above 
however  our assumptions are subject to change based on fluctuations in our actual results and market conditions 
assuming all other factors remain the same  actual results and changes in assumptions for the americas and international reporting units would have to cause our cash flow projections for both reporting units over the long term to deviate approximately and  respectively  from previous projections or the discount rate would have to increase approximately and percentage points  respectively  for goodwill to be considered for impairment 
as of december   considering relevant prices of our common shares  our market capitalization  along with a reasonable control premium  exceeds the aggregate carrying values of our reporting units 
in december  we announced a realignment of our executive management team  which  among other things  will eliminate the previous separation of the americas and international divisions into one global asset management business during fiscal however  as of march   our internal management reporting has not changed 
as a result  the americas and international operating segments continued to be our reporting units 
stock based compensation our stock based compensation plans include stock options  employee stock purchase plans  market based performance share awards  restricted stock awards and deferred compensation payable in stock 
under our stock compensation plans  we issue equity awards to directors  officers  and key employees 
in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance  compensation expense for the years ended march   and includes compensation cost for all non vested share based awards at their grant date fair value amortized over the respective vesting periods on the straight line method 
unamortized deferred compensation is recognized as a reduction of additional paid in capital 
also under the accounting guidance  cash flows related to income tax deductions in excess of or less than the stock based compensation expense are classified as financing cash flows 
we granted million  million  and million stock options in fiscal  and  respectively 
for additional information on share based compensation  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we determine the fair value of each option grant using the black scholes option pricing model  except for market based grants  for which we use a monte carlo option pricing model 
both models require management to develop estimates regarding certain input variables 
the inputs for the black scholes model include stock price on the date of grant  exercise price of the option  dividend yield  volatility  expected life and the risk free interest rate  all of which except the grant date stock price and the exercise price require estimates or assumptions 
we calculate the dividend yield based upon the average of the historical quarterly dividend payments over a term equal to the vesting period of the options 
we estimate volatility equally weighted between the historical prices of our stock over a period equal to the expected life of the option and the implied volatility of market listed options at the date 
table of contents of grant 
the expected life is the estimated length of time an option will be held before it is either exercised or canceled  based upon our historical option exercise experience 
the risk free interest rate is the rate available for zero coupon us government issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the options being valued 
if we used different methods to estimate our variables for the black scholes and monte carlo models  or if we used a different type of option pricing model  the fair value of our option grants might be different 
income taxes we are subject to the income tax laws of the federal  state and local jurisdictions of the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions in which we operate 
we file income tax returns representing our filing positions with each jurisdiction 
due to the inherent complexities arising from conducting business and being taxed in a substantial number of jurisdictions  we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining our income tax provision for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments are used in determining the tax basis of assets and liabilities and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing of revenue and expense recognition for tax and financial statement purposes 
management assesses the likelihood that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets 
if it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized  then a valuation allowance is established with a corresponding increase to deferred tax provision 
substantially all of our deferred tax assets relate to us and united kingdom uk taxing jurisdictions 
as of march   uk federal deferred tax assets aggregated million  realization of which is expected to require billion of future us earnings  approximately million of which must be in the form of foreign sourced income 
deferred tax assets generated in us jurisdictions resulting from net operating losses generally expire years after they are generated and those resulting from foreign tax credits generally expire years after they are generated 
based on estimates of future taxable income  using assumptions consistent with those used in our goodwill impairment testing  it is more likely than not that current federal tax benefits relating to net operating losses are realizable and no valuation allowance is necessary at this time 
with respect to those resulting from foreign tax credits  it is more likely than not that tax benefits relating to million foreign tax credits will not be realizable and a valuation allowance has been established with respect thereto 
as of march   us state deferred tax assets aggregated million 
due to limitations on net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards and  taking into consideration certain state tax planning strategies  a valuation allowance has been established for the state capital loss and net operating loss benefits in certain jurisdictions in the amount of million for fiscal due to the uncertainty of future state apportionment factors and future effective state tax rates  the value of state net operating loss benefits ultimately realized may vary 
as of march   uk deferred tax assets  net of valuation allowances  are not material 
an additional valuation allowance was recorded on million of foreign deferred tax assets relating to various jurisdictions  principally relating to foreign currency translation adjustments recorded in equity 
to the extent our analysis of the realization of deferred tax assets relies on deferred tax liabilities  we have considered the timing  nature and jurisdiction of reversals  as well as  future increases relating to the tax amortization of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets 
while tax planning may enhance our positions  the realization of current tax benefits is not dependent on any significant tax strategies 
in the event we determine all or any portion of our deferred tax assets that are not already subject to a valuation allowance are not realizable  we will be required to establish a valuation allowance by a charge to the income tax provision in the period in which that determination is made 
depending on the facts and circumstances  the charge could be material to our earnings 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax uncertainties in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due
