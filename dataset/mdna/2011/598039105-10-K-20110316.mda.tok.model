under the risk based capital requirements for bank holding companies  the minimum requirement for the ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets including certain off balance sheet activities  such as standby letters of credit is 
at least half of the total capital as defined below is to be composed of common stockholders equity  retained earnings  qualifying perpetual preferred stock in a limited amount in the case of cumulative preferred stock  minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries  and qualifying trust preferred securities  less goodwill and certain intangibles tier capital 
the remainder of total capital may consist of qualifying subordinated debt and redeemable preferred stock  qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock and allowance for loan losses tier capital  and together with tier capital  total capital 
at december   our tier capital ratio was and total capital ratio was 
the federal reserve has established minimum leverage ratio guidelines for bank holding companies 
these requirements provide for a minimum leverage ratio of tier capital to adjusted average quarterly assets leverage ratio equal to for bank holding companies that meet specified criteria  including having the highest regulatory rating 
all other bank holding companies will generally be required to maintain a leverage ratio of at least 
our leverage ratio at december   was 
the guidelines also provide that bank holding companies experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels without significant reliance on intangible assets 
furthermore  the guidelines provide that the federal reserve will continue to consider a tangible tier leverage ratio deducting all intangibles in evaluating proposals for expansion or to engage in new activity 
the dodd frank act prohibits insured depository institutions and their holding companies from engaging in proprietary trading except in limited circumstances  and prohibits them from owning equity interests in excess of three percent of a bank s tier capital in private equity and hedge funds 
the federal reserve released a final rule on february  effective on april  which requires a banking entity  a term that is defined to include bank holding companies like the company  to bring its proprietary trading activities and investments into compliance with the dodd frank act restrictions no later than two years after the earlier of july   or months after the date on which interagency final rules are adopted 
pursuant to the compliance date final rule  banking entities are permitted to request an extension of this timeframe from the federal reserve 
we will review the implications of the interagency rules on our investments once those rules are issued and will adjust our activities or holdings in order to comply 
the bank is subject to similar capital requirements adopted by the occ 
the risk based capital requirements identify concentrations of credit risk and certain risks arising from non traditional activities  and the management of those risks  as important factors to consider in assessing an institution s overall capital adequacy 
other factors taken into consideration by federal regulators include interest rate exposure  liquidity  funding and market risk  the quality and level of earnings  the quality of loans and investments  the effectiveness of loan and investment policies  and management s overall ability to monitor and control financial and operational risks  including the risks presented by concentrations of credit and non traditional activities 
prompt corrective action the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of fdicia established a system of prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of undercapitalized institutions 
under this system  the federal banking regulators have established five capital categories well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized  and are required to take certain mandatory supervisory actions  and are authorized to take other discretionary actions  with respect to institutions in the three undercapitalized categories 
the severity of the action will depend upon the capital category in which the institution is placed 
generally  subject to a narrow exception  the banking regulator must appoint a receiver or conservator for an institution that is critically undercapitalized 
the federal banking agencies have set the relevant capital level for each category 
an institution that is categorized as undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  or critically undercapitalized is required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan to its appropriate federal regulatory agency 
a bank holding company must guarantee that a subsidiary depository institution meets its capital restoration plan  subject to certain limitations 
the controlling holding company obligation to fund a capital restoration plan is limited to the lesser of of an undercapitalized subsidiary assets or the amount required to meet regulatory capital requirements 
an undercapitalized institution is also generally prohibited from increasing its average total assets  making acquisitions  establishing any branches or engaging in any new line of business  except under an accepted capital restoration plan or with fdic approval 
in addition  the appropriate federal regulatory agency may treat an undercapitalized institution in the same manner as it treats a significantly undercapitalized institution if it determines that those actions are necessary 
at december   the bank had the requisite capital level to qualify as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
fdic insurance assessments the bank is a member of  and pays its deposit insurance assessments to the deposit insurance fund the dif  as well as assessments by the fdic to pay interest on financing corporation fico bonds 
the fdic establishes rates for the payment of premiums by federally insured banks and federal savings associations for deposit insurance 
the fdic has revised its risk based assessment system as required by the fdicia 
under current fdic rules  banks and federal savings associations must pay assessments to the fdic for federal deposit insurance protection at rates based on their risk classification 
institutions assigned to higher risk classifications that is  institutions that pose a higher risk of loss to the fdic s dif under this assessment system pay assessments at higher rates than institutions that pose a lower risk 
an institution s risk classification is assigned based on its capital levels and the level of supervisory concern the institution poses to the regulators 
in addition  the fdic can impose special assessments in certain instances 
at december   our risk category required a quarterly payment of approximately basis points per of assessable deposits 
the dodd frank act set a new minimum dif reserve ratio at of estimated insured deposits  which the fdic must attain by september  in addition  the dodd frank act will have a significant impact on the calculation of deposit insurance assessment premiums going forward 
specifically  the dodd frank act generally requires the fdic to define the deposit insurance assessment base for an insured depository institution as an amount equal to the institution s average consolidated total assets during the assessment period minus average tangible equity 
the fdic issued a final rule that implements this change to the assessment calculation on february  the assessment rate schedule for larger institutions ie  institutions greater than billion in assets will differentiate between such large institutions by use of a scorecard that combines an institution s camels ratings with certain forward looking financial information to measure the risk to the dif 
pursuant to this scorecard method  two scores a performance score and a loss severity score will be combined and converted to an initial base assessment rate 
the performance score measures an institution s financial performance and ability to withstand stress 
the loss severity score measures the relative magnitude of potential losses to the fdic in the event of the institution s failure 
total scores are converted pursuant to a predetermined formula into an initial base assessment rate 
the new assessment rules will take effect for the quarter beginning april   and will be reflected in the june  fund balance and the invoices for assessments due september  premiums for the bank will be calculated based upon the average balance of total assets minus tangible equity as of the close of business for each day during the calendar quarter 
the proposed fdic rule also provides the fdic s board with the flexibility to adopt actual rates that are higher or lower than the total base assessment rates adopted without notice and comment  if certain conditions are met 
we currently expect our fdic assessment rate to decrease as a result of these new changes 
fico assessments are set by the fdic quarterly and are used towards the retirement of fico bonds issued in the s to assist in the recovery of the savings and loan industry 
these assessments will continue until the fico bonds mature in the fico assessment rate was basis points for the fourth quarter of compared to basis points for the first quarter of for each in domestic deposits 
allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance for loan and lease losses the alll represents one of the most significant estimates in the bank s financial statements and regulatory reports 
because of its significance  the bank has established a system by which it develops  maintains  and documents a comprehensive  systematic  and consistently applied process for determining the amounts of the alll and the provision for loan and lease losses 
the interagency policy statement on the alll  issued on december   encourages all banks and federal savings institutions to ensure controls are in place to consistently determine the alll in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  the federal savings association s stated policies and procedures  management s best judgment and relevant supervisory guidance 
the bank s estimate of credit losses reflects consideration of significant factors that affect the collectability of the portfolio as of the evaluation date 
safety and soundness standards the federal deposit insurance act  as amended by the fdicia and the riegle community development and regulatory improvement act of  requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to prescribe standards  by regulations or guidelines  relating to internal controls  information systems and internal audit systems  loan documentation  credit underwriting  interest rate risk exposure  asset growth  asset quality  earnings  stock valuation and compensation  fees and benefits  and such other operational and managerial standards as the agencies deem appropriate 
the federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted a set of guidelines prescribing safety and soundness standards pursuant to fdicia  as amended 
the guidelines establish general standards relating to internal controls and information systems  internal audit systems  loan documentation  credit underwriting  interest rate exposure  asset growth and compensation and fees and benefits 
in general  the guidelines require  among other things  appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risks and exposures specified in the guidelines 
the guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer  employee  director  or principal shareholder 
in addition  the agencies adopted regulations that authorize  but do not require  an agency to order an institution that has been given notice by an agency that it is not satisfying any of such safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan 
if  after being so notified  an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an acceptable compliance plan  the agency must issue an order directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order directing other actions of the types to which an undercapitalized institution is subject under the prompt corrective action provisions of fdicia 
see prompt corrective action above 
if an institution fails to comply with such an order  the agency may seek to enforce such order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil money penalties 
the federal regulatory agencies also proposed guidelines for asset quality and earnings standards 
interagency appraisal and evaluation guidelines in december  the federal banking agencies issued the interagency appraisal and evaluation guidelines 
this guidance  which updated guidance originally issued in  sets forth the minimum regulatory standards for appraisals 
it incorporates previous regulatory issuances affecting appraisals  addresses advances in information technology used in collateral evaluation  and clarifies standards for use of analytical methods and technological tools in developing evaluations 
this guidance also requires institutions to utilize strong internal controls to ensure reliable appraisals and evaluations and to monitor and periodically update valuations of collateral for existing real estate loans and transactions 
community reinvestment act under the community reinvestment act cra the bank has an obligation to help meet the credit needs of the entire community  including low and moderate income neighborhoods  consistent with safe and sound banking practices 
the cra requires the appropriate federal regulator  in connection with its examination of an insured institution  to assess the institution record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications  such as applications for a merger or the establishment of a branch 
an unsatisfactory rating may be used as the basis for the denial of an application by the federal banking regulator 
the bank received a satisfactory rating in its most recent cra examination 
restrictions on transactions with affiliates we are subject to the provisions of section a of the federal reserve act 
section a places limits on the amount of a bank s loans or extensions of credit to affiliates  a bank s investment in affiliates  assets a bank may purchase from affiliates  except for real and personal property exemption by the federal reserve  the amount of loans or extensions of credit to third parties collateralized by the securities or obligations of affiliates  and a bank s guarantee  acceptance or letter of credit issued on behalf of an affiliate 
the total amount of the above transactions is limited in amount  as to any one affiliate  to of a bank s capital and surplus and  as to all affiliates combined  to of a bank s capital and surplus 
in addition to the limitation on the amount of these transactions  each of the above transactions must also meet specified collateral requirements 
the bank must also comply with other provisions designed to avoid the taking of low quality assets 
we are also subject to the provisions of section b of the federal reserve act which  among other things  prohibit an institution from engaging in the above transactions with affiliates unless the transactions are on terms substantially the same  or at least as favorable to the institution or its subsidiaries  as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies 
the dodd frank act changed the definition of covered transaction in sections a and b and limitations on asset purchases from insiders 
with respect to the definition of covered transaction  the dodd frank act defines that term to include the acceptance of debt obligations issued by an affiliate as collateral for a bank s loan or extension of credit to another person or company 
in addition  a derivative transaction with an affiliate is now deemed to be a covered transaction to the extent that such a transaction causes a bank or its subsidiary to have a credit exposure to the affiliate 
in addition  the dodd frank act provides that the bank may not purchase an asset from  or sell an asset to a bank insider or their related interests unless the transaction is conducted on market terms  and if the proposed transaction represents more than percent of the capital stock and surplus of the bank  it has been approved in advance by a majority of the bank s non interested directors 
the bank is also subject to restrictions on extensions of credit to its executive officers  directors  principal shareholders and their related interests 
these extensions of credit must be made on substantially the same terms  including interest rates and collateral  as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with third parties  and must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features 
usa patriot act of in october  the usa patriot act of the patriot act was enacted in response to the terrorist attacks in new york  pennsylvania  and washington  dc that occurred on september  the patriot act impacts financial institutions in particular through its anti money laundering and financial transparency laws 
the patriot act amended the bank secrecy act and the rules and regulations of the office of foreign assets control to establish regulations which  among others  set standards for identifying customers who open an account and promoting cooperation with law enforcement agencies and regulators in order to effectively identify parties that may be associated with  or involved in  terrorist activities or money laundering 
in  congress passed the usa patriot act improvement and reauthorization act of this act reauthorized all provisions of the patriot act that would otherwise have expired  made of the sunsetting provisions permanent  and extended the sunset period of the remaining two for an additional four years 
privacy financial institutions are required to disclose their policies for collecting and protecting confidential information 
customers generally may prevent financial institutions from sharing personal financial information with nonaffiliated third parties except for third parties that market the institutions own products and services 
additionally  financial institutions generally may not disclose consumer account numbers to any nonaffiliated third party for use in telemarketing  direct mail marketing or other marketing through electronic mail to consumers 
the bank has established policies and procedures designed to safeguard its customers personal financial information and to ensure compliance with applicable privacy laws 
other regulations interest and other charges collected or contracted for by the bank are subject to federal laws concerning interest rates 
the bank s loan operations are also subject to federal laws applicable to credit transactions  such as the federal truth in lending act  governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers  home mortgage disclosure act of  requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves  equal credit opportunity act  prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race  creed  or other prohibited factors in extending credit  fair credit reporting act of  governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies  and rules and regulations of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing these federal laws 
the deposit operations of the bank are subject to the following the right to financial privacy act  which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records  the electronic funds transfer act and regulation e issued by the federal reserve to implement that act  which govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services  and the truth in savings act  which requires disclosure of yields and costs of deposits and deposit accounts 
effect of governmental monetary policies our earnings are affected by the monetary and fiscal policies of the united states government and its agencies  as well as general domestic economic conditions 
the federal reserve s power to implement national monetary policy has had  and is likely to continue to have  an important impact on the operating results of financial institutions 
the federal reserve affects the levels of bank loans  investments  and deposits through its control over the issuance of us government securities and through its regulation of the discount rate on borrowings of member banks and the reserve requirements against member bank deposits 
it is not possible to predict the nature  timing or impact of future changes in monetary and fiscal policies 
emergency economic stabilization act of and subsequent legislation the emergency economic stabilization act of eesa was enacted on october  eesa authorizes the us department of the treasury treasury to invest up to billion in troubled assets  to provide capital  or to otherwise provide assistance to us banks  federal savings institutions and their holding companies tarp 
pursuant to authority granted under eesa  the treasury will invest or has invested up to billion in senior preferred stock of us banks and federal savings institutions or their holding companies under the capital purchase program the cpp 
qualifying financial institutions may issue senior preferred stock with a value equal to not less than of risk weighted assets and not more than the lesser of billion or of risk weighted assets 
in january  we issued million in series a preferred stock to the treasury under the cpp  which was promulgated under tarp 
as a result of our participation in the cpp  we are subject to the treasury s standards for executive compensation and corporate governance as long as the treasury holds the equity issued under the cpp 
these standards generally apply to the chief executive officer  chief financial officer and the three next most highly compensated senior executive officers 
the standards include ensuring that incentive compensation for senior executives does not encourage unnecessary and excessive risks that threaten the value of the financial institution  required clawback of any bonus or incentive compensation paid to a senior executive based on statements of earnings  gains or other criteria that are later proven to be materially inaccurate  prohibitions on making golden parachute payments to senior executives  and an agreement not to deduct for tax purposes executive compensation in excess of  for each senior executive 
on february   the treasury announced the financial stability plan the financial stability plan  which earmarked billion of the tarp funds authorized under eesa 
among other things  the financial stability plan includes a capital assistance program cap that will invest in mandatory convertible preferred stock of certain qualifying institutions determined on a basis and through a process similar to the cpp  a consumer and business lending initiative to fund new consumer loans  small business loans and commercial mortgage asset backed securities issuances  a new public private investment fund that will leverage public and private capital with public financing to purchase up to billion to trillion of legacy toxic assets from financial institutions  and assistance for homeowners by providing up to billion to reduce mortgage payments and interest rates and establishing loan modification guidelines for government and private programs 
institutions receiving assistance under the financial stability plan going forward will be subject to higher transparency  corporate governance and accountability standards  including restrictions on dividends  acquisitions  executive compensation and additional disclosure requirements 
on february   the american recovery and reinvestment act the arra became law 
the arra purports to retroactively impose certain new executive compensation and corporate expenditure limits and corporate governance standards on all current and future recipients of tarp funds  including us  that are in addition to those previously announced by the treasury  until the institution has repaid the treasury 
item a risk factors an investment in our stock involves a number of risks 
investors should carefully consider the following risks as well as the other information in this report and the documents incorporated by reference before making an investment decision 
the realization of any of the risks described below could have a material adverse effect on the company and the price of our common stock 
risks relating to our business the current economic environment poses significant challenges and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
there was significant disruption and volatility in the financial and capital markets during the past few years 
the financial markets and the financial services industry in particular suffered unprecedented disruption  causing a number of institutions to fail or require government intervention to avoid failure 
these conditions were largely the result of the erosion of the us and global credit markets  including a significant and rapid deterioration in mortgage lending and related real estate markets 
continued declines in real estate values  high unemployment and financial stress on borrowers as a result of the uncertain economic environment could have an adverse effect on our borrowers or their customers  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  financial condition and results of operations 
as a consequence of the difficult economic environment  we experienced a significant decrease in earnings resulting primarily from increased provisions for loan losses 
there can be no assurance that the economic conditions that have adversely affected the financial services industry  and the capital  credit and real estate markets generally  will improve in the near term  in which case we could continue to experience write downs of assets  and could face capital and liquidity constraints or other business challenges 
a further deterioration in economic conditions  particularly within our market areas  could result in the following consequences  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  financial condition and results of operations loan delinquencies may further increase causing additional increases in our provision and allowance for loan losses 
our ability to assess the creditworthiness of our customers may be impaired if the models and approaches we use to select  manage  and underwrite our customers become less predictive of future charge offs 
collateral for loans made by the bank  especially real estate  may continue to decline in value  in turn reducing a customer s borrowing power  and reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with our loans 
consumer confidence levels may decline and cause adverse changes in payment patterns  resulting in increased delinquencies and default rates on loans and other credit facilities and decreased demand for our products and services 
our market areas are heavily dependent on  and we have significant credit exposure to  the oil and gas industry 
the economy in a large portion of our market areas is heavily dependent on the oil and gas industry 
many of our customers provide transportation and other services and products that support oil and gas exploration and production activities 
accordingly  as of december   we had approximately million in loans to borrowers in the oil and gas industry  representing approximately of our total loans outstanding as of that date 
the oil and gas industry  especially in louisiana and texas  has been subject to significant volatility  including the oil bust of the s that severely impacted the economies of many of our market areas 
recently  president obama s administration proposed a number of legislative changes that could significantly impact the oil and gas industry  including the elimination of certain tax breaks  such as the intangible drilling and development costs  percentage depletion and manufacturing deduction  and the implementation of an excise tax focused specifically on production in the gulf of mexico 
if there is a significant downturn in the oil and gas industry  generally the cash flows of our customers in this industry would be adversely impacted which could impair their ability to service our loans outstanding to them and or reduce demand for loans 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  financial condition and results of operations 
we may suffer losses in our loan portfolio in excess of our allowance for loan losses 
we have experienced increases in the levels of our non performing assets and loan charge offs in recent periods 
our total non performing assets amounted to million  or of our total assets  at december  and we had million of net loan charge offs and a million provision for loan losses for the year ended december  at december   the ratios of our alll to non performing loans and to total loans outstanding were and  respectively 
additional increases in our non performing assets or loan charge offs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we seek to mitigate the risks inherent in our loan portfolio by adhering to specific underwriting practices 
these practices include analysis of a borrower s prior credit history  financial statements  tax returns and cash flow projections  valuation of collateral based on reports of independent appraisers and verification of liquid assets 
although we believe that our underwriting criteria are appropriate for the various kinds of loans we make  we still may incur losses on loans that meet our underwriting criteria  and these losses may exceed the amounts set aside as reserves in our alll 
we create an alll in our accounting records  based on  among other considerations  the following industry historical losses as reported by the fdic  historical experience with our loans  evaluation of economic conditions  regular reviews of the quality mix  including our distribution of loans by risk grade within our portfolio  and size of our overall loan portfolio  regular reviews of delinquencies  and the quality of the collateral underlying our loans 
although we maintain an alll at a level that we believe is adequate to absorb losses inherent in our loan portfolio  changes in economic  operating and other conditions  including conditions which are beyond our control such as a sharp decline in real estate values and changes in interest rates  may cause our actual loan losses to exceed our current allowance estimates 
additions to the alll could result in a decrease in net earnings and capital and could hinder our ability to grow 
further  if our actual loan losses exceed the amount reserved  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot predict the effect of recent or future legislative and regulatory initiatives 
financial institutions have been the subject of substantial legislative and regulatory changes and may be the subject of further legislation or regulation in the future  including i changes in banking  securities and tax laws and regulations and their application by our regulators  including pursuant to the dodd frank act  as discussed below  ii changes in the scope and cost of fdic insurance and other coverages  and iii changes in the cpp under tarp administered by the treasury which we participated in by issuing million in shares of our series a preferred stock and associated common stock warrants to the treasury in january the cpp transaction  none of which is within our control 
significant new laws or regulations or changes in  or repeals of  existing laws or regulations may cause our results of operations to differ materially from those we currently anticipate 
in addition  the cost and burden of compliance with applicable laws and regulations have significantly increased and could adversely affect our ability to operate profitably 
further  federal monetary policy significantly affects credit conditions for us  as well as for our borrowers  particularly as implemented by the federal reserve board  primarily through open market operations in us government securities  the discount rate for bank borrowings and reserve requirements 
a material change in any of these conditions could have a material impact on us or our borrowers  and therefore on our business  prospects  financial condition and results of operations 
we expect to continue to face increased regulation and supervision of our industry as a result of the continuing economic instability  and there may be additional requirements and conditions imposed on us as a result of our issuance of the series a preferred stock in the cpp transaction and our potential participation in the small business lending fund 
such additional regulation and supervision may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities 
the affects of such recently enacted  and proposed  legislation and regulatory programs on us cannot reliably be determined at this time 
the full impact of the recently enacted dodd frank act is currently unknown given that much of the details and substance of the new laws will be implemented through agency rulemakings 
the dodd frank act was signed into law in july and represents a comprehensive overhaul of the us financial services industry 
the dodd frank act requires federal agencies to adopt nearly new rules and conduct more than studies over the course of the next few years  ensuring that the federal regulations and implementing policies in these areas will continue to develop for the foreseeable future 
the dodd frank act includes a number of provisions that will likely impact our operations  including establishing the cfpb which will have broad rulemaking  supervisory and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws and may directly impact the scope and cost of products and services we offer could have a significant effect on our financial performance  changes to the fdic s insurance assessment methodology  permanently increasing deposit insurance coverage to  and unlimited fdic deposit insurance for noninterest bearing transaction accounts through january   authorizing the federal reserve to set debit interchange fees in an amount that is reasonable and proportional to the costs incurred by processors and card issuers 
notably  a proposed federal reserve rule that would limit this interchange fee to cents per transaction has been announced but  has not yet been finalized  requiring federal regulators to establish new minimum leverage and risk based capital requirements for large banks  bank holding companies and systemically important non banks  and codifying what was previously a regulatory policy that bank holding companies act as a source of strength for their depository institution subsidiaries 
based on the text of the dodd frank act and the anticipated implementing regulations  including recent amendments  it is anticipated that the costs to banks and their holding companies may increase or fee income may decrease significantly which could adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
moreover  compliance obligations will expose us to additional noncompliance risk and could divert management s focus from the business of banking 
the cfpb may reshape the consumer financial laws through rulemaking and enforcement of the prohibitions against unfair  deceptive and abusive business practices  which may directly impact the business operations of depository institutions offering consumer financial products or services  including the bank 
the cfpb has broad rulemaking authority to administer and carry out the provisions of the dodd frank act with respect to financial institutions that offer to consumers covered financial products and services 
the cfpb has also been directed to write rules identifying practices or acts that are unfair  deceptive or abusive in connection with any transaction with a consumer for a consumer financial product or service  or the offering of a consumer financial product or service 
the concept of what may be considered to be an abusive practice is new under the law 
the full scope of the impact of this authority has not yet been determined as the implementing rules of the dodd frank act with respect to the cfpb have not yet been released 
while the bank will not be supervised by the cfpb  it will still be subject to the regulations and policies promulgated by the cfpb and may be examined by the occ for compliance therewith 
the costs and limitations related to complying with any new regulations established by the cfpb have yet to be fully determined and could be material 
further  the limitations and restrictions that will be placed upon the bank with respect to its consumer product offering and services may also produce significant  material effects on the bank s and our profitability 
we have a concentration of exposure to a number of individual borrowers 
given the size of these loan relationships relative to capital levels and earnings  a significant loss on any one of these loans could materially and adversely affect us 
we have a concentration of exposure to a number of individual borrowers 
our largest exposure to one borrowing relationship as of december   was approximately million  which is of our total capital 
in addition  as of december   the aggregate exposure to the ten largest borrowing relationships was approximately million  which was of loans and of total capital 
as a result of this concentration  a change in the financial condition of one or more of these borrowers could result in significant loan losses and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
a large percentage of our deposits are attributable to a relatively small number of customers 
the loss of all or some of these customers or a significant decline in their deposit balances may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and results of operations 
our largest depositors accounted for approximately of our total deposits and our five largest depositors accounted for approximately of our total deposits as of december  the ability to attract these types of deposits has a positive effect on our net interest margin as they provide a relatively low cost of funds to the bank 
while we believe we have strong  long term relationships with each of these customers  the loss of one or more of our largest customers  or a significant decline in the deposit balances would adversely affect our liquidity and require us to attract new deposits  purchase federal funds or borrow funds on a short term basis to replace such deposits  possibly at interest rates higher than those currently paid on these deposits 
this could increase our total cost of funds and could result in a decrease in our net interest income and net earnings 
if we were unable to develop alternative funding sources  we may have difficulty funding loans or meeting other deposit withdrawal requirements 
we occasionally purchase non recourse loan participations from other banks based in part on information provided by the selling bank 
from time to time  we purchase loan participations from other banks in the ordinary course of business  usually without recourse to the selling bank 
as of december   we had approximately million in purchased loan participations  or approximately of our total loan portfolio 
when we purchase loan participations  we apply the same underwriting standards as we would to loans that we directly originate and seek to purchase only loans that would satisfy these standards 
however  we are not as familiar with the borrower and may rely on information provided to us by the selling bank and typically must rely on the selling bank s administration of the loan relationship 
we therefore have less control over  and may incur more risk with respect to  loan participations that we purchase from selling banks as compared to loans that we originate 
our focus on lending to small to mid sized community based businesses may increase our credit risk 
most of our commercial business and commercial real estate loans are made to small business or middle market customers 
these businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities and have a heightened vulnerability to economic conditions 
if general economic conditions in the markets in which we operate negatively impact this important customer sector  our results of operations and financial condition and the value of our common stock may be adversely affected 
moreover  a portion of these loans have been made by us in recent years and the borrowers may not have experienced a complete business or economic cycle 
furthermore  the deterioration of our borrowers businesses may hinder their ability to repay their loans with us  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our loan portfolio includes a substantial percentage of commercial and industrial loans  which may be subject to greater risks than those related to residential loans 
our loan portfolio includes a substantial percentage of commercial and industrial loans 
commercial and industrial loans generally carry larger loan balances and historically have involved a greater degree of financial and credit risks than residential first mortgage loans 
repayment of our commercial and industrial loans is often dependent on cash flow of the borrower  which may be unpredictable  and collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value 
our commercial and industrial loans are primarily made based on the cash flow of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower 
most often  this collateral is accounts receivable  inventory  equipment  or real estate 
in the case of loans secured by accounts receivable  the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect amounts due from its customers 
other collateral securing loans may depreciate over time  may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business 
at december   commercial and industrial loans totaled approximately of our total loan portfolio 
adverse changes in local economic conditions impacting our business borrowers could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  financial condition and results of operations 
we have a high concentration of loans secured by real estate  and the current downturn in the real estate market could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
a significant portion of our loan portfolio is dependent on real estate 
at december   approximately of our loans had real estate as a primary or secondary component of collateral 
the collateral in each case provides an alternate source of repayment if the borrower defaults and may deteriorate in value during the time the credit is extended 
an adverse change in the economy affecting values of real estate in our primary markets could significantly impair the value of real estate collateral and the ability to sell real estate collateral upon foreclosure 
furthermore  it is likely that we would be required to increase the provision for loan losses 
a related risk in connection with loans secured by real estate is the effect of unknown or unexpected environmental contamination  which could make the real estate effectively unmarketable or otherwise significantly reduce its value as collateral 
if we were required to liquidate real estate collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt during a period of reduced real estate values or to increase the allowance for loan losses  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we may face risks with respect to future expansion and acquisition opportunities 
we have expanded our business in part through acquisitions and will continue to look at future acquisitions as a way to further increase our growth 
however  we cannot assure you that we will be successful in completing any future acquisitions 
further  failure to realize the potential expected revenue increases  cost savings  increases in geographic or product presence  and or other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  financial condition and results of operations 
we may seek merger or acquisition partners that are culturally similar and have experienced management and possess either significant market presence or have potential for improved profitability through financial management  economies of scale or expanded services 
we do not currently have any specific plans  arrangements or understandings regarding such expansion 
we cannot say with any certainty that we will be able to consummate  or if consummated  successfully integrate future acquisitions or that we will not incur disruptions or unexpected expenses in integrating such acquisitions 
in attempting to make such acquisitions  we anticipate competing with other financial institutions  many of which have greater financial and operational resources 
acquiring other banks  businesses  or branches involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions  including  among other things potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company  expansion into new markets that may have different characteristics than our current markets and may otherwise present management challenges  exposure to potential asset quality issues of the target company  difficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of the target company  potential disruption to our business  potential diversion of management s time and attention  the possible loss of key employees and customers of the target institution  difficulty in estimating the value of the target company  and potential changes in banking  accounting or tax laws or regulations that may affect the target institution 
if we acquire the assets and liabilities of one or more target banks that are in receivership through the fdic bid process for failed institutions  such an acquisition will require us  through our bank subsidiary  to enter into a purchase and assumption agreement the p a agreement with the fdic 
the p a agreement is a form document prepared by the fdic  and our ability to negotiate the terms of this agreement is limited 
as a result  we expect that any p a agreement would provide for limited disclosure about  and limited indemnification for  risks associated with the target bank 
there is a risk that such disclosure regarding  and indemnification for  the assets and liabilities of target banks will not be sufficient and we will incur unanticipated losses 
there is also a risk that we may be required to make an additional payment to the fdic under certain circumstances following the completion of an fdic assisted acquisition if  for example  actual losses related to the target bank s assets acquired are substantially less than expected at the time the p a agreement was entered into 
in addition  the fdic bid process for failed depository institutions is competitive 
we cannot provide any assurances that we will be successful in bidding for any target bank or for other failed depository institutions 
our future earnings could be adversely affected by non cash charges for goodwill impairment  if a future test of goodwill indicates that goodwill has been impaired 
as prescribed by accounting standards codification asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other  we undertake an annual review of the goodwill asset balance reflected in our financial statements 
we conduct an annual review in the fourth quarter of each year  unless there has been a triggering event prescribed by applicable accounting rules that warrants an earlier interim testing for possible goodwill impairment 
in addition  after our annual review in the fourth quarter of  we concluded there was no goodwill impairment as of such date 
as of december   we had million in goodwill 
future goodwill impairment tests may result in future non cash charges  which could adversely affect our earnings for any such future period 
changes in the fair value of our securities may reduce our shareholders equity and net income 
at december   million of our securities at fair value were classified as available for sale 
at such date  the aggregate net unrealized gain on our available for sale securities was million 
we increase or decrease shareholders equity by the amount of change from the unrealized gain or loss the difference between the estimated fair value and the amortized cost of our available for sale securities portfolio  net of the related tax  under the category of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
therefore  a decline in the estimated fair value of this portfolio will result in a decline in reported shareholders equity  as well as book value per common share and tangible book value per common share 
this decrease will occur even though the securities are not sold 
in the case of debt securities  if these securities are never sold and there are no credit impairments  the decrease will be recovered over the life of the securities 
in the case of equity securities which have no stated maturity  the declines in fair value may or may not be recovered over time 
we monitor the fair value of our entire securities portfolio as part of our ongoing other than temporary impairment otti evaluation process 
no assurance can be given that we will not need to recognize otti charges related to securities in the future 
in addition  as a condition to membership in the federal home loan bank of dallas fhlb dallas  we are required to purchase and hold a certain amount of fhlb dallas stock 
our stock purchase requirement is based  in part  upon the outstanding principal balance of advances from the fhlb dallas 
at december   we had stock in the fhlb dallas totaling approximately  the fhlb dallas stock held by us is carried at cost and is subject to recoverability testing under applicable accounting standards 
for the year ended december   we did not recognize an impairment charge related to our fhlb dallas stock holdings 
there can be no assurance  however  that future negative changes to the financial condition of the fhlb dallas may not require us to recognize an impairment charge with respect to such holdings 
we rely heavily on our management team and the loss of key officers may adversely affect operations 
our success has been and will continue to be greatly influenced by the ability to retain existing senior management and  with expansion  to attract and retain qualified additional senior and middle management 
cr cloutier  president and chief executive officer  and other executive officers have been instrumental in developing and managing our business 
over the past several years  we have had a number of changes in our senior management team  including the appointment of a new chief financial officer 
james mclemore  chief credit officer  john nichols  and the head of the retail division of the bank  carolyn lay 
additionally  in february  we hired a chief operating officer  gerald reaux  and appointed a chief banking officer  troy cloutier 
we typically do not have employment agreements with our executive officers  including cr cloutier 
in addition  a formal management succession plan has not been established 
our participation in the cpp transaction could also have an adverse effect on our ability to attract and retain qualified executive officers 
the arra included amendments to the executive compensation provisions of the eesa under which the cpp was established  including extensive new restrictions on our ability to pay retention awards  bonuses and other incentive compensation during the period in which we have any outstanding securities held by the treasury that were issued in the cpp transaction 
many of the restrictions are not limited to our senior executives and cover other employees whose contributions to revenue and performance can be significant 
the limitations may adversely affect our ability to recruit and retain these key employees in addition to our senior executive officers  especially if we are competing for talent against institutions that are not subject to the same cpp restrictions 
while we have applied for funds under the small business lending fund the sblf to repay the amounts we received under the cpp transaction  no assurance can be provided that our application under the sblf will be approved or that similar regulations will not be adopted for sblf participants 
in addition  the dodd frank act requires federal bank regulators to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to executives of depository institutions and their holding companies with assets in excess of billion 
such rules  when adopted  may adversely affect our management retention and limit our ability to promote our objectives through our compensation and incentive programs and  as a result  adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 
the full scope and impact of these limitations are uncertain 
the treasury adopted standards that implement certain compensation limitations  but these standards have not yet been broadly interpreted and remain  in many respects  ambiguous 
the new and potential future legal requirements  including those under the cpp or that are adopted with respect to the sblf or pursuant to the dodd frank act  may have unforeseen or unintended adverse effects on the financial services industry as a whole  including us 
it will likely require significant time  effort and resources on our part to interpret and apply them 
if any of our regulators believe that our response to new and future legal requirements and implementing standards does not fully comply with them  it could subject us to regulatory actions or otherwise adversely affect our management retention and  as a result  our results of operations and financial condition 
loss of key employees may disrupt relationships with certain customers 
as a community bank  our business is primarily relationship driven in that many of our key employees have extensive customer relationships 
we generally do not have employment agreements with any of our key employees  including our executive officers 
loss of a key employee with such customer relationships may lead to the loss of business if the customers were to follow that employee to a competitor 
while we believe our relationship with our key personnel is good  we cannot guarantee that all of our key personnel will remain with our organization 
loss of such key personnel  should they enter into an employment relationship with one of our competitors  could result in the loss of some of our customers 
a natural disaster  especially one affecting one of our market areas  could adversely affect us 
since most of our business is conducted in louisiana and texas  most of our credit exposure is in those states 
historically  louisiana and texas have been vulnerable to natural disasters 
therefore  we are susceptible to the risks of natural disasters  such as hurricanes  floods and tornados 
natural disasters could harm our operations directly through interference with communications  including the interruption or loss of our websites  which would prevent us from gathering deposits  originating loans and processing and controlling our flow of business  as well as through the destruction of facilities and our operational  financial and management information systems 
a natural disaster or recurring power outages may also impair the value of our largest class of assets  our loan portfolio  as uninsured or underinsured losses  including losses from business disruption  may reduce borrowers ability to repay their loans 
disasters may also reduce the value of the real estate securing our loans  impairing our ability to recover on defaulted loans through foreclosure and making it more likely that we would suffer losses on defaulted loans 
although we have implemented several back up systems and protections and maintain business interruption insurance  these measures may not protect us fully from the effects of a natural disaster 
the occurrence of natural disasters in our market areas could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  financial condition and results of operations 
our profitability is vulnerable to interest rate fluctuations 
our profitability is dependent to a large extent on net interest income  which is the difference between our interest income on interest earning assets  such as loans and investment securities  and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
when interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest earning assets in a given period  a significant increase in market rates of interest could adversely affect net interest income 
conversely  when interest earning assets mature or reprice more quickly than interest bearing liabilities  falling interest rates could result in a decrease in net interest income 
for example  as securities in our investment portfolio have matured  they have been replaced by securities paying a lower yield 
we expect this trend to continue during these changes in our investment portfolio have negatively impacted  and are expected to continue to negatively impact  our net interest margin 
furthermore  some of our variable interest rate loans have minimum fixed interest rates floors that are currently above the contractual variable interest rate 
if interest rates rise  the interest income from our variable interest rate loans with floors may not increase as quickly as interest expense on our liabilities  which would negatively impact our net interest income 
in periods of increasing interest rates  loan originations may decline  depending on the performance of the overall economy  which may adversely affect income from lending activities 
also  increases in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of fixed income assets 
in addition  an increase in the general level of interest rates may affect the ability of certain borrowers to pay the interest and principal on their obligations 
non performing assets take significant time to resolve and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
non performing assets adversely affect our net earnings in various ways 
until economic and market conditions improve  we expect to incur provisions for loan losses relating to an increase in non performing assets 
we generally do not record interest income on non performing loans or other real estate owned  thereby adversely affecting our earnings  and increasing our loan administration costs 
when we take collateral in foreclosures and similar proceedings  we mark the related asset to the then fair market value of the collateral less estimated selling costs  which may result in a loss 
an increase in the level of non performing assets increases our risk profile and may impact the capital levels our regulators believe are appropriate in light of the ensuing risk profile 
while we reduce problem assets through loan sales  workouts  restructurings and otherwise  decreases in the value of the underlying collateral  or in these borrowers performance or financial condition  whether or not due to economic and market conditions beyond our control  could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  the resolution of non performing assets requires significant commitments of time from management and our directors  which can be detrimental to the performance of their other responsibilities 
there can be no assurance that we will not experience future increases in non performing assets 
the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us 
financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading  clearing  counterparty  or other relationships 
we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties  and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry  including commercial banks  brokers and dealers  investment banks and other institutional clients 
many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client 
in addition  our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due to us 
any such losses could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  financial condition and results of operations 
we operate within a highly regulated environment and our business and results are affected by the regulations to which we are subject 
we operate within a highly regulated environment 
the regulations to which we are subject will continue to have an impact on our operations and the degree to which we can grow and be profitable 
certain regulators  to which we are subject  have significant power in reviewing our operations and approving our business practices 
in recent years the bank  as well as other financial institutions  has experienced increased regulation and regulatory scrutiny  often requiring additional resources 
in addition  investigations or proceedings brought by regulatory agencies may result in judgments  settlements  fines  penalties  or other results adverse to us 
there is no assurance that any change to the regulatory requirements to which we are subject  or the way in which such regulatory requirements are interpreted or enforced  will not have a negative effect on our ability to conduct our business and our results of operations 
we rely heavily on technology and computer systems 
the negative effects of computer system failures and unethical individuals with the technological ability to cause disruption of service could adversely affect our reputation and our ability to generate deposits 
our ability to compete depends on our ability to continue to adapt and deliver technology on a timely and cost effective basis to meet customers demands for financial services 
we provide our customers the ability to bank online and many customers now remotely submit deposits to us through remote capture systems 
the secure transmission of confidential information over the internet is a critical element of these services 
our network could be vulnerable to unauthorized access  computer viruses  phishing schemes and other security problems 
we may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches and computer viruses  or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches or viruses 
to the extent that our activities or the activities of our customers involve the storage and transmission of confidential information  security breaches and viruses could expose us to claims  litigation and other possible liabilities 
any inability to prevent security breaches or computer viruses could also cause existing customers to lose confidence in our systems and could adversely affect our reputation and our ability to generate deposits 
consumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions 
technology and other changes are allowing parties to complete financial transactions through alternative methods that historically have involved banks 
for example  consumers can now maintain funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts  mutual funds or general purpose reloadable prepaid cards 
consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills and or transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks 
the process of eliminating banks as intermediaries  known as disintermediation  could result in the loss of fee income  as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits 
the loss of these revenue streams and the lower cost of deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
risks relating to an investment in our common stock share ownership may be diluted by the issuance of additional shares of common stock in the future 
our stock incentive plan provides for the granting of stock incentives to directors  officers  and employees 
as of december   there were  shares issued under options and  shares in restricted stock granted under that plan 
likewise  approximately  shares  including shares issuable under currently outstanding options  may be issued in the future to directors  officers  and employees under our existing equity incentive plans 
in addition  on january   the company issued million in preferred stock to the treasury in the cpp transaction 
as part of the cpp transaction  we also granted the treasury a year stock purchase warrant 
under the warrant  the treasury has the right to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
it is probable that options and or warrants will be exercised during their respective terms if the stock price exceeds the exercise price of the particular option or warrant 
the incentive plan also provides that all issued options automatically and fully vest upon a change in control 
if the options are exercised  share ownership will be diluted 
in addition  our articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of up to  shares of common stock and  shares of preferred stock  but do not provide for preemptive rights to the shareholders  therefore  shareholders will not automatically have the right to subscribe for additional shares 
as a result  if we issue additional shares to raise additional capital or for other corporate purposes  you may be unable to maintain a pro rata ownership in the company 
the holders of our preferred stock and trust preferred securities have rights that are senior to those of shareholders and that may impact our ability to pay dividends on our common stock and net income available to our common shareholders 
at december   we had outstanding million of trust preferred securities 
these securities are senior to shares of common stock 
as a result  we must make payments on our trust preferred securities before any dividends can be paid on our common stock  moreover  in the event of our bankruptcy  dissolution  or liquidation  the obligations outstanding with respect to our trust preferred securities must be satisfied before any distributions can be made to our shareholders 
while we have the right to defer dividends on the trust preferred securities for a period of up to five years  if any such election is made  no dividends may be paid to our common or preferred shareholders during that time 
in addition  with respect to the million in series a preferred stock outstanding that was issued to the treasury in the cpp transaction  we are required to pay cumulative dividends on the series a preferred stock at an annual rate of for the first five years and thereafter  unless we redeem the shares earlier 
dividends paid on our series a preferred stock will also reduce the net income available to our common shareholders and our earnings per common share 
we may not declare or pay dividends on our common stock or repurchase shares of our common stock without first having paid all accrued cumulative preferred dividends that are due 
until january  we also may not increase our per share common stock dividend rate or repurchase shares of our common shares without the treasury s consent  unless the treasury has transferred to third parties all the series a preferred stock originally issued to it 
we have applied to participate in the sblf and  if approved  will issue new shares of preferred stock to the treasury 
we will use the net proceeds from the sale of the shares of preferred stock to repurchase the outstanding shares of series a preferred stock 
any new shares of preferred stock issued in connection with the sblf will require us to pay dividends at a rate that will be dependent on our volume of qualified small business loans 
there can be no assurance whether or when the series a preferred stock can be redeemed or whether or when the related warrant can be repurchased 
subject to approval of our regulators  we generally have the right to repurchase the shares of series a preferred stock and the associated warrant issued to the treasury in the cpp transaction 
we have applied to participate in the sblf and  if approved  will issue new shares of preferred stock to the treasury and use the net proceeds from the sale thereof to repurchase the outstanding shares of series a preferred stock 
however  there can be no assurance that our application will be approved and  if we are not approved to participate under the sblf  as to when the series a preferred stock and the warrant will be repurchased  if at all 
as a result  we will remain subject to the uncertainty of additional future changes to the cpp  which could put us at a competitive disadvantage 
until such time as the series a preferred stock and the warrant are repurchased  we will remain subject to the terms and conditions of those instruments  which  among other things  require us to obtain regulatory approval to repurchase or redeem our common stock or our other preferred stock or increase the annual aggregate dividends on our common stock over per share  except in limited circumstances 
holders of the series a preferred stock may  under certain circumstances  have the right to elect two directors to our board of directors 
in the event that we fail to pay dividends on the series a preferred stock for an aggregate of six quarterly dividend periods or more  the authorized number of directors then constituting our board of directors will be increased by two 
holders of the series a preferred stock  together with the holders of any outstanding parity stock with the same voting rights  will be entitled to elect the two additional members of the board of directors at the next annual meeting or at a special meeting called for this purpose and at each subsequent annual meeting until all accrued and unpaid dividends for all past dividend periods have been paid in full 
only a limited trading market exists for our common stock  which could lead to price volatility 
our common stock is listed for trading on the nyse amex under the trading symbol msl  but there is low trading volume in our common stock 
the limited trading market for our common stock may cause fluctuations in the market value of our common stock to be exaggerated  leading to price volatility in excess of that which might occur in a more active trading market of our common stock 
future sales of substantial amounts of common stock in the public market  or the perception that such sales may occur  could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock 
in addition  even if a more active market in our common stock develops  we cannot assure you that such a market will continue 
our directors and executive management own a significant number of shares of stock  allowing further control over business and corporate affairs 
our directors and executive officers beneficially own approximately million shares  or  of our outstanding common stock as of december  as a result  in addition to their day to day management roles  they will be able to exercise significant influence on our business as shareholders  including influence over election of the board and the authorization of other corporate actions requiring shareholder approval 
in deciding on how to vote on certain proposals  our shareholders should be aware that our directors and executive officers may have interests that are different from  or in addition to  the interests of our shareholders generally 
provisions of our articles of incorporation and by laws  louisiana law  and state and federal banking regulations  could delay or prevent a takeover by a third party 
our articles of incorporation and by laws could delay  defer  or prevent a third party takeover  despite possible benefit to the shareholders  or otherwise adversely affect the price of our common stock 
our governing documents permit directors to be removed by shareholders only for cause and only upon an vote  require of the voting power for shareholders to amend the by laws  call a special meeting  or amend the articles of incorporation  in each case if the proposed action was not approved by the board  authorize a class of preferred stock that may be issued in series with terms  including voting rights  established by the board without shareholder approval  authorize approximately million shares of common stock and million shares of preferred stock that may be issued by the board without shareholder approval  classify our board with staggered three year terms  preventing a change in a majority of the board at any annual meeting  require advance notice of proposed nominations for election to the board and business to be conducted at a shareholder meeting  and require of the voting power for shareholders to approve business combinations not approved by the board 
these provisions would likely preclude a third party from removing incumbent directors and simultaneously gaining control of the board by filling the vacancies thus created with its own nominees 
under the classified board provisions  it would take at least two elections of directors for any individual or group to gain control of the board 
accordingly  these provisions could discourage a third party from initiating a proxy contest  making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to gain control 
these provisions may have the effect of delaying consideration of a shareholder proposal until the next annual meeting unless a special meeting is called by the board or the chairman of the board 
moreover  even in the absence of an attempted takeover  the provisions make it difficult for shareholders dissatisfied with the board to effect a change in the board s composition  even at annual meetings 
also  we are subject to the provisions of the louisiana business corporation law lbcl  which provides that we may not engage in certain business combinations with an interested shareholder generally defined as the holder of or more of the voting shares unless the transaction was approved by the board before the interested shareholder became an interested shareholder or the transaction was approved by at least two thirds of the outstanding voting shares not beneficially owned by the interested shareholder and of the total voting power or certain conditions relating to the price to be paid to the shareholders are met 
the lbcl also addresses certain transactions involving control shares  which are shares that would have voting power with respect to the company within certain ranges of voting power 
control shares acquired in a control share acquisition have voting rights only to the extent granted by a resolution approved by our shareholders 
if control shares are accorded full voting rights and the acquiring person has acquired control shares with a majority or more of all voting power  shareholders of the issuing public corporation have dissenters rights as provided by the lbcl 
our future ability to pay dividends and repurchase stock is subject to restrictions 
since we are a holding company with no significant assets other than the bank  we have no material source of income other than dividends received from the bank 
therefore  our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders will depend on the bank s ability to pay dividends to us 
moreover  banks and bank holding companies are both subject to certain federal and state regulatory restrictions on cash dividends 
we are also restricted from paying dividends if we have deferred payments of the interest on  or an event of default has occurred with respect to  our trust preferred securities or series a preferred stock 
additionally  terms and conditions of our outstanding shares of preferred stock place certain restrictions and limitations on our common stock dividends and repurchases of our common stock 
a shareholder s investment is not an insured deposit 
an investment in our common stock is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the fdic or any other government agency 
your investment in our common stock will be subject to investment risk and you may lose all or part of your investment

cash dividends totaling million were declared to common shareholders during a quarterly dividend of per share was paid for each quarter of  for a total of per share for the year 
under the louisiana law  we may not pay a dividend if i we are insolvent or would thereby be made insolvent  or ii the declaration or payment thereof would be contrary to any restrictions contained in our articles of incorporation 
our primary source of funds for dividends is the dividends we receive from the bank  therefore  our ability to declare dividends is highly dependent upon future earnings  financial condition  and results of operation of the bank as well as applicable legal restrictions on the bank s ability to pay dividends and other relevant factors 
the bank currently has the ability to declare dividends to us without prior approval of our primary regulators 
however  the bank s ability to pay dividends to us will be prohibited if the result would cause the bank s regulatory capital to fall below minimum requirements 
additionally  dividends to us cannot exceed a total of the bank s current year and prior two years earnings  net of dividends paid to us in those years 
pursuant to the terms of the agreements between us and the treasury governing the cpp transaction  we may not declare or pay any dividend or make any distribution on our common stock other than i regular quarterly cash dividends not exceeding an annual aggregate of per share  ii dividends payable solely in shares of our common stock  and iii dividends or distributions of rights of junior stock in connection with a shareholders rights plan 
further  the terms of our trust preferred securities prohibit us from paying dividends on our common stock during any period in which we have deferred interest payments on the trust preferred securities

our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
the accounting principles we follow and the methods of applying these principles conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap and general banking practices 
our most critical accounting policy relates to the allowance for loan losses  which reflects the estimated losses resulting from the inability of its borrowers to make loan payments 
if the financial condition of our borrowers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  the estimates would be updated and additional provisions for loan losses may be required 
see asset quality allowance for loan losses 
another of our critical accounting policies relates to goodwill and intangible assets 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired 
goodwill is not amortized  but is evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if deemed necessary 
if the fair value of an asset exceeds the carrying amount of the asset  no charge to goodwill is made 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset  goodwill will be adjusted through a charge to earnings 
given the current instability of the economic environment  it is reasonably possible that the methodology of the assessment of potential loan losses and goodwill impairment could change in the near term or could result in impairment going forward 
overview we are a bank holding company  headquartered in lafayette  louisiana  that through our community banking subsidiary  midsouth bank  na  operates offices in south louisiana and southeast texas 
we had approximately billion in consolidated assets as of december  we derive the majority of our income from interest received on our loans and investments 
our primary source of funds for making these loans and investments is our deposits  on which we pay interest 
approximately of our total deposits are interest bearing 
consequently  one of the key measures of our success is our amount of net interest income  or the difference between the income on our interest earning assets  such as loans and investments  and the expense on our interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
another key measure is the spread between the yield we earn on these interest earning assets and the rate we pay on our interest bearing liabilities  which is called our net interest spread 
there are risks inherent in all loans  so we maintain an allowance for loan losses to absorb probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible 
we maintain this allowance by charging a provision for loan losses against our operating earnings for each period 
we have included a detailed discussion of this process  as well as several tables describing our allowance for loan losses 
our financial performance for the years ended december  and were  and continue to be  significantly impacted by the disruptions in the national economy and the resulting financial uncertainty that has severely impacted the banking industry 
while we believe our market areas have fared better than the national economy during this most recent economic downturn  the economic uncertainty and difficult real estate markets had an impact on our loan losses  loan demand and our interest rate spread 
in addition to earning interest on our loans and investments  we earn income through fees and other charges to our customers 
we have also included a discussion of the various components of this noninterest income  as well as of our noninterest expense 
we plan to continue to grow both organically and through acquisitions  including potential expansion into new market areas 
to support our growth  shareholders approved an increase in our authorized shares of common stock from million to million shares at our annual shareholders meeting in may additionally  in december  we completed a public offering of approximately million shares of our common stock for which we received net proceeds of approximately million including shares issued upon the underwriter s exercise of their over allotment option in january 
as a result of the offering  we cut in half the number of shares underlying the warrants we issued to the treasury as part of the cpp transaction 
we believe our current financial condition  coupled with our scalable operational capabilities will allow us to act upon growth opportunities in the current banking environment 
the following discussion and analysis also identifies significant factors that have affected our financial position and operating results during the periods included in the financial statements accompanying or incorporated by reference in this report 
we encourage you to read this discussion and analysis in conjunction with our financial statements and the other statistical information included and incorporated by reference in this report 
results of operations net income available to common shareholders for the year ended december  totaled million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or

the majority of the growth was in noninterest bearing deposits and resulted primarily from new commercial account relationships added in total loans were million at december   a decrease of million  or  from the million reported as of december  although we experienced increased loan activity in the second and third quarters of  commercial and consumer customers continued to pay down debt and resulted in decreased loan volume year over year

the tier common equity ratio at december  was 
return on average common equity was for compared to for return on average assets was compared to for the same periods  respectively 
the million increase in net earnings available to common shareholders in resulted primarily from a  increase in net interest income  which was driven by a million reduction in interest expense 
an  decrease in non interest expense also contributed to the improvement in earnings  with significant decreases recorded in salary and benefits costs million  occupancy expense  and fdic premiums 
the decrease in salaries and benefit costs resulted primarily from a million reduction in group health insurance expense as our partially self funded group health insurance plan experienced a lower amount of insurance claims in the reduction in occupancy expense resulted primarily from a  decrease in depreciation cost and a  decrease in lease expense 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in other non interest expense categories  including  in data processing expense   in expenses on other real estate owned  and  in atm debit card processing expense 
additionally  the provision for loan loss decreased  in year over year comparison 
the earnings improvement from increased net interest income combined with decreases in non interest expense and the provision for loan losses was partially offset by an  increase in tax expense  an  decrease in non interest income  and a  increase in preferred dividends 
nonaccrual loans totaled million as of december   compared to million as of december  the million increase in nonaccruals in year over year comparison resulted primarily from a million commercial development loan in the texas market added in the third quarter of of the remaining million in nonaccrual loans  million  or  represented two large commercial real estate loan relationships in the baton rouge market 
loans past due days or more and still accruing totaled  at december   a decrease of  from december  total nonperforming assets to total assets were at december   compared to at december  loans classified as troubled debt restructurings during the fourth quarter of consisted primarily of two small commercial loans totaling  the two loans were classified as trouble debt restructurings due to a reduction in monthly payments granted to the borrowers 
allowance coverage for nonperforming loans was at december   compared to at december  year to date net charge offs were of total loans as of december  compared to as of december  the allowance coverage for nonperforming loans ratio declined in despite an increase in the alll total loans ratio from at december  to at december  the decreased coverage ratio for nonperforming loans resulted primarily from loans placed on nonaccrual status in that did not require specific reserves due to sufficient underlying collateral values 
table summary of return on equity and assets return on average assets return on average common equity dividend payout ratio on common stock average equity to average assets earnings analysis net interest income our primary source of earnings is net interest income  which is the difference between interest earned on loans and investments and interest paid on deposits and other interest bearing liabilities 
changes in the volume and mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities combined with changes in market rates of interest greatly affect net interest income 
our net interest margin on a taxable equivalent basis  which is net interest income as a percentage of average earning assets  was   and for the years ended december    and  respectively

as a result  during both and we experienced some contraction in our net interest margin and expect to continue to experience additional contraction into however  because of our base of core deposits described below under funding sources deposits  we expect our net interest margin to remain strong

net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis increased  for over  as a million reduction in interest expense offset a million decrease in interest income 
the decrease in interest income on earning assets resulted primarily from the combination of a million decrease in the average volume of loans  combined with an basis point decline in the average yield on loans  from at december  to at december  the decline in loan volume resulted primarily from payoffs in the commercial  financial  and agricultural portfolio 
loan yields declined as matured loans re priced in the lower rate environment and new loan rates reflected competitive market pricing 
additionally  interest income on investment securities for decreased as a basis point reduction in the average yield earned on investment securities offset the impact of a million increase in the average volume of investment securities 
the reduction in the average yield on investment securities from at december  to at december  resulted from the reinvestment of excess cash in short term us agency bonds at lower yields 
interest expense decreased primarily due to a basis point reduction in the average rate paid on interest bearing deposits  from at december  to at december  additionally  interest paid on securities sold under agreements to repurchase and on the junior subordinated debentures decreased due to rate reductions 
as a result  the taxable equivalent net interest margin declined basis points  from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  included in taxable equivalent net interest income  is a  one time recovery of interest income on a million nonaccrual commercial loan that was paid off in december net of the  recovery of interest income  the taxable equivalent margin would have decreased basis points in prior year comparison 
net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis increased  for over the  increase in taxable equivalent net interest income resulted primarily from a million decrease in interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  offset by a million decrease in taxable equivalent interest income on earning assets 
interest expense on interest bearing liabilities decreased primarily due to a basis point decrease in the average rate paid on interest bearing deposits  from at december  to at december  additionally  the average volume of interest bearing deposits declined million  from million at december  to million at december  increased interest expense on securities sold under agreements to repurchase in  due to a million increase in average volume  was offset by a decrease in interest expense due to rate reductions on borrowings and the junior subordinated debentures

average loan yields decreased basis points  from at december   to at december   primarily due to maturing and repricing loans adjusting to lower rates of interest in the current environment 
an increase in loan volume of million  or  partially offset the decrease in rates and resulted in a million decrease in interest earned on loans for taxable equivalent yields also fell basis points on investment securities  from at december  to at december   as new purchases were added at much lower rates in noninterest income noninterest income totaled million at december   compared to million at december  and million at december  service charges and fees on deposit accounts represent the primary source of noninterest income for the company 
income from service charges and fees on deposit accounts  including insufficient funds fees nsf fees  decreased  in compared to a  increase in the decrease in was primarily due to a  reduction of nsf fee income  which resulted from fewer nsf items processed 
as discussed below  we believe this was primarily driven by the changes implemented in our policies in connection with the changes in regulation e in income on atm and debit card transactions increased  in and  in as the result of an increase in electronic transactions processed 
other noninterest income increased  in and decreased  in the  increase in resulted primarily from a  impairment charge on an equity security recorded in the  decrease in included the  impairment charge  a  decrease in income from a third party investment advisory firm  and a  one time payment recorded in other non interest income in the one time payment resulted from visa s mandatory redemption of a portion of its class b shares outstanding in connection with its initial public offering 
during  we addressed changes in regulation e  which became effective on august  regulation e governs the treatment of electronic funds transfers and the bank s ability to collect fees for overdrafts involving atm and point of sale debit transactions 
the amendments to regulation e required that we give our customers the option to continue to receive approval on and payment of point of sale transactions only if they have chosen overdraft protection 
as a result of offering the required option  of our customers affected opted to continue to access a form of overdraft protection for approval on and payment of point of sale transactions 
the changes in regulation e did have an impact on overdraft fees earned on electronic transactions in and could further reduce overdraft fees earned in future periods 
noninterest expense total noninterest expense decreased  or  from to  and increased  or  from to salaries and employee benefits decreased million  or  in and the total of full time equivalent fte employees was  a decrease of employees from fte employees at year end salary and benefit costs decreased in primarily due to a million reduction in group health insurance expense as midsouth s partially self funded group health insurance plan experienced a lower amount of insurance claims in salaries and employee benefits increased  or  in  primarily due to a  increase in group health insurance costs which was partially offset by a decrease of employees from the fte employees at year end occupancy expenses decreased  in and increased  in the reduction in occupancy expense in resulted primarily from a  decrease in depreciation cost and a  decrease in lease expense 
the  increase in resulted primarily from a  increase in lease expense and a  increase in depreciation expense primarily as a result of the renovation of our corporate headquarters 
premises and equipment additions and leasehold improvements totaled approximately million  million  and million for the years   and  respectively 
atm and debit card processing fees increased  in and decreased  in the net change in both and are primarily due to fluctuations in fraud losses on electronic transactions 
data processing costs  included in other non interest expense  increased  in and decreased  in the increase in is primarily attributed to a  one time accrual for a data processing contract cancellation expensed in the third quarter of other non interest expense increases in included  in expenses on other real estate owned and  in costs associated with a customer relationship management system 
these increased non interest expenses were partially offset by a  decrease in fdic fees 
the reduction in fdic fees was due to a one time assessment of approximately  paid in the second quarter of efforts to reduce controllable expenses in resulted in significant reductions in marketing costs  professional fees  corporate development  training expenses  and other noninterest expense categories 
these noninterest expense reductions offset increased fdic premiums of  or a increase over the  in premiums expensed in income taxes income tax expense increased by  in and decreased by  in and approximated   and of income before taxes in  and  respectively 
the lower effective tax rate was due primarily to the impact of nontaxable municipal interest on the statutory tax rate 
additionally  the lower tax rates for and resulted from recognition of the work opportunity tax credit under the katrina emergency tax relief act of  which reduced income tax expense by  in and  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements provide additional information regarding income tax considerations 
balance sheet analysis investment securities total investment securities decreased million in  from million in to million at december  the decrease resulted primarily from million in maturities and calls of securities within the portfolio in  partially offset by million in purchased securities

unrealized net gains before tax effect in the securities available for sale portfolio were million at december   compared to unrealized net gain before tax effect of million at december  these amounts result from interest rate fluctuations

a detailed credit analysis on each municipal offering is reviewed prior to purchase 
in addition  we limit the amount of securities of any one municipality purchased and the amount purchased within specific geographic regions to reduce the risk of loss within the nontaxable municipal securities portfolio

loan portfolio the loan portfolio totaled million at december   down  or million  from million at december  although we experienced increased loan activity in the second and third quarters of  commercial and consumer customers continued to pay down debt  which resulted in decreased loan volume year over year 
the commercial portfolio  including financial and agricultural loans  decreased million in included in the million was the payout of a million nonaccrual loan and million loan participation in the fourth quarter of the installment loan portfolio decreased million in  primarily due to a million decrease in our indirect automobile financing portfolio 
the decrease in indirect auto loans resulted from stricter underwriting standards combined with a decline in volume due to current economic conditions 
total real estate construction loans increased million and commercial real estate loans grew million 
the majority of the loans added in these two portfolios during are secured by owner occupied commercial properties 
additionally  the growth was diversified throughout our louisiana and texas markets 
the commercial real estate loan growth consisted primarily of credits that have ten to fifteen year amortization terms with rates fixed primarily for three years  but up to five years 
we believe the short term structure of these real estate mortgage credits allows greater flexibility in controlling interest rate risk 
the loan portfolio at december  consisted of approximately in fixed rate loans  with the majority maturing within five years 
approximately of the portfolio earns a variable rate of interest  the greater majority of which adjusts to changes in the prime rate and a smaller portion that adjusts on a scheduled repricing date 
the mix of variable and fixed rate loans provides some protection from changes in market rates of interest 
additionally  over the past two years  we established rate floors  primarily for our commercial loans  that provided some protection to our net interest margin during a sustained low rate environment like we are currently facing

in  we added a chief credit officer cco responsible for credit underwriting and loan operations for the bank 
the role of cco includes on going review and development of lending policies and practices  along with credit risk management procedures 
the current risk management process requires that each individual loan officer review his or her portfolio on a quarterly basis and assign recommended credit ratings on each loan 
these efforts are supplemented by independent reviews performed by the loan review officer and other validations performed by the internal audit department 
the results of the reviews are reported directly to the audit committee of the board of directors 
we believe the conservative nature of our underwriting practices has resulted in strong credit quality in our loan portfolio 
completed loan applications  credit bureau reports  financial statements  and a committee approval process remain a part of credit decisions 
documentation of the loan decision process is required on each credit application  whether approved or denied  to insure thorough and consistent procedures 
additionally  we have historically recognized and disclosed significant problem loans quickly and taken prompt action to address material weaknesses in those credits 
our loan review process also includes monitoring and reporting of loan concentrations whereby individual customer and aggregate industry leverage  profitability  risk rating distributions  and liquidity are evaluated for each major standard industry classification segment 
at december   one industry segment concentration  the oil and gas industry  aggregate more than of our loan portfolio 
our exposure in the oil and gas industry  including related service and manufacturing industries  totaled approximately million  or of total loans

we currently do not expect to record additional loan loss provisions related to this credit as a result of foreclosure based on a current appraisal of the collateral 
the increase in nonperforming assets in and resulted primarily from two large credit relationships secured by commercial real estate in the baton rouge market 
one credit relationship involves two loans that were placed on nonaccrual status in and totaled million at december  of the million  one loan totaling million is secured by a condominium complex 
subsequent to year end  information received on the million loan prompted us to charge off  in specific reserves allocated to the loan 
we expect the property will be transferred to other real estate owned within the first or second quarter of  which will require an updated valuation analysis and may result in additional loan loss provisions

allowance coverage for nonperforming loans was at december   compared to at december  the allowance coverage for nonperforming loans ratio declined in despite an increase in the alll total loans ratio from at december  to at december  the decreased coverage ratio for nonperforming loans resulted primarily from loans placed on nonaccrual status in that did not require specific reserves due to sufficient underlying collateral values

the allowance is comprised of specific reserves assigned to each impaired loan for which probable loss has been identified as well as general reserves to maintain the allowance at an acceptable level for other loans in the portfolio where historical loss experience is available that indicates certain probable losses may exist 
factors considered in determining provisions include estimated losses in significant credits  known deterioration in concentrations of credit  historical loss experience  trends in nonperforming assets  volume  maturity and composition of the loan portfolio  off balance sheet credit risk  lending policies and control systems  national and local economic conditions  the experience  ability and depth of lending management  and the results of examinations of the loan portfolio by regulatory agencies and others 
the processes by which we determine the appropriate level of the allowance  and the corresponding provision for probable credit losses  involves considerable judgment  therefore  no assurance can be given that future losses will not vary from current estimates

while the net unrealized loss or gain on securities available for sale is required to be reported as a separate component of shareholders equity  it does not affect operating results or regulatory capital ratios 
the net unrealized gains and losses reported for december  and  however  did affect the equity to assets ratio for financial reporting purposes 
the ratio of equity to assets was at december  and at december  asset liability management and interest rate sensitivity interest rate sensitivity is the sensitivity of net interest income and economic value of equity to changes in market rates of interest 
the primary objective of our asset and liability management process is to evaluate interest rate sensitivity inherent in our balance sheet components and establish guidelines to manage that risk within acceptable performance levels 
management and our board of directors are responsible for determining the appropriate level of acceptable risk based on our strategic focus  regulatory requirements for capital and liquidity  and the market environment 
our board of directors established an asset liability management committee alco  comprised of certain executive and senior officers of the bank  to measure and monitor interest rate risk within defined parameters 
during  alco utilized a qualified third party s model of asset and liability management to measure interest rate risk using net interest income simulation and economic value of equity sensitivity analysis 
the third party utilizes its own proprietary software to model our assets and liabilities 
the model captures data from our internal operating systems  an external investment portfolio accounting system and additional information regarding rates and prepayment characteristics to construct an analysis that presents differences in repricing  cash flows and the maturity characteristics of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities for selected time periods

instantaneous rate shifts are known as rate shocks because all rates are modeled to change instantaneously by the indicated shock amount 
ramped rate shifts model gradual shifts over a period of time and generally provide more realistic projections of changes in net interest income and market risk 
results of the simulations were compared to a base case scenario that provided projected net interest income over the next twelve months with no change in the balance sheet 
the estimated percentage changes in projected net interest income due to changes in interest rates of   and basis points as determined through the simulations are included in table at december   simulation results indicated that our balance sheet is slightly asset sensitive in terms of interest rate sensitivity and were within policy guidelines 
the results of the simulations are reviewed by alco and discussed quarterly at funds management committee meetings of our board of directors 
although we revised our asset liability and funds management policy in january to allow for the potential use of interest rate derivatives  we have neither entered into any interest rate swaps or off balance sheet derivatives to modify interest sensitivity levels nor has the board of directors yet authorized management to do so 
liquidity bank liquidity liquidity is the availability of funds to meet maturing contractual obligations and to fund operations 
the bank s primary liquidity needs involve its ability to accommodate customers demands for deposit withdrawals as well as customers requests for credit 
liquidity is deemed adequate when sufficient cash to meet these needs can be promptly raised at a reasonable cost to the bank 
liquidity is provided primarily by three sources a stable base of funding sources  an adequate level of assets that can be readily converted into cash  and borrowing lines with correspondent banks 
our core deposits are our most stable and important source of funding 
cash deposits at other banks  federal funds sold  and principal payments received on loans and mortgage backed securities provide additional primary sources of liquidity 
approximately million in projected cash flows from securities repayments during provides an additional source of liquidity 
the bank also has significant borrowing capacity with the federal reserve bank of atlanta frb and with the fhlb dallas 
as of december   we had no borrowings with the frb atlanta or the fhlb dallas 
the company has million in borrowing capacity at the frb discount window and has the ability to post additional collateral of approximately million if necessary to meet liquidity needs 
additionally  million in loan collateral is pledged under a borrower in custody line with the frb atlanta 
under existing agreements with the fhlb dallas  our borrowing capacity totaled million at december  additional unsecured borrowing lines totaling million are available through correspondent banks 
we utilize these contingency funding alternatives to meet deposit volatility  which is more likely in the current environment  given unusual competitive offerings within our markets 
company liquidity on december   we closed an underwritten public offering of million shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
on january   the underwriters of the public offering exercised in full their overallotment option for  additional shares of our common stock 
net proceeds from the offering and the exercise of the overallotment option totaled million after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses 
we used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes including supporting ongoing and anticipated growth  which may include potential acquisition opportunities 
on january   our participation in the cpp of the treasury offered under the eesa added million in liquidity and capital 
we distributed the majority of the proceeds to the bank for the purpose of funding loans 
some of the proceeds were retained at the company to meet the dividend requirement on the series a preferred stock issued to the treasury under the cpp 
as part of the cpp transaction  we issued the treasury warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
however  as a result of the completion of our public offering in december  the number of shares subject to the warrants held by the treasury was reduced to  shares 
we are currently evaluating our options for repayment of the series a preferred stock 
in connection therewith  in march we applied for approximately million in funds under the sblf authorized by congress under the small business jobs act of if our application is approved to participate under the sblf  we would issue shares of a new series of preferred stock to the treasury and use the net proceeds to repurchase our existing million in series a preferred stock and expect to use any remaining proceeds to support our continued growth 
the dividend rate on the shares of preferred stock issued in connection with the sblf will be dependent on our volume of qualified small business loans 
no assurances can be provided however that our application under the sblf will be approved 
at the company level  cash is needed primarily to meet interest payments on the junior subordinated debentures  dividend payments on the series a preferred stock  issued in the cpp transaction  and dividends on the common stock 
we issued  in unsecured junior subordinated debentures in september and  in february  the terms of which are described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
dividends from the bank totaling million provided additional liquidity for the company in although no dividends have been paid to the company in  as of january   the bank had the ability to pay dividends to the company of approximately million without prior approval from its primary regulator 
at december   the parent company had approximately million cash available for general corporate purposes  including injecting capital into the bank 
as a publicly traded company  the company also has the ability  subject to market conditions  to issue additional shares of common stock  trust preferred and other securities to provide funds as needed for operations and future growth of the company 
dividends the primary source of cash dividends on the company common stock is dividends from the bank 
the bank has the ability to declare dividends to the company of up to million as of december  without prior approval of primary regulators 
however  the bank s ability to pay dividends would be prohibited if the result would cause the bank s regulatory capital to fall below minimum requirements 
cash dividends totaling million and million were declared to common shareholders during and  respectively 
pursuant to the terms of the agreements between us and the treasury governing the cpp transaction  we may not pay cash dividends on our common stock in excess of per share per year 
a special dividend of per share was paid in addition to the regular per share dividend for the fourth quarter of to shareholders of record on december  off balance sheet arrangements and other contractual obligations in the normal course of business we use various financial instruments with off balance sheet risk to meet the financing needs of customers and to reduce exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and letters of credit 
those instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the financial statements 
we did not have an average balance in any category of short term borrowings detailed below in   or that exceeded of our stockholders equity for such year 
additional information regarding contractual obligations appears in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the following table presents significant contractual obligations as of december  table contractual obligations in thousands payment due by period year more than total or less years years years time deposits federal funds purchased long term debt obligations retail repurchase agreements reverse repurchase agreements operating lease obligations total impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  presented herein  have been prepared in accordance with gaap  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time and due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of operations 
unlike most industrial companies  nearly all of our assets and liabilities are financial 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on our performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation
