item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
the following discussion is intended to analyze major elements of our consolidated financial statements and provide insight into important areas of management s focus 
this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
we have accounted for the discontinuance or disposal of certain businesses as discontinued operations and have adjusted prior period financial information to exclude these businesses from continuing operations 
statements in the following discussion may include forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
see item a 
risk factors  for additional discussion of these factors and risks 
business overview marked by the significant environmental impact in the us gulf of mexico as a result of the macondo oil spill  the year of ushered in a new regulatory climate for offshore energy operators 
despite the october lifting of a federally mandated deepwater drilling moratorium  offshore oil and gas industry regulations  as administered by the newly formed boemre  have resulted in delays and added regulatory costs to offshore projects 
in addition  newly enacted regulations have also imposed requirements on operators  particularly affecting the abandonment and decommissioning of offshore oil and gas wells and production platforms 
the new regulatory environment following the macondo incident significantly affected our operations during and will continue to affect certain of our businesses going forward 
our fluids division revenues were n egatively affected during by the decreased activity caused by the moratorium and the ensuing permitting delays that continue to hamper the timing of offshore drilling projects by its customers 
until the first deepwater drilling permit was approved by boemre on february   no permits to drill in the deepwater us gulf of mexico had been issued since the macondo oil spill 
our gulf of mexico fluids division activity will not fully recover until the pace of permitting reaches the pre macondo spill level 
our offshore services segment operations were also affected by project delays on its offshore operations during  resulting from plug and abandonment permitting delays 
going forward  however  the demand for abandonment and decommissioning services on offshore assets is expected to increase  perhaps significantly  as a result of new regulations 
in particular  the ntl g  or idle iron guidance  issued by the boemre in september  will require many operators t o accelerate decommissioning plans 
our maritech segment operations were also affected  as the expected increased demand for abandonment and decommissioning services as a result of the new regulations will increase maritech s cost for these activities 
the increased cost estimates for future maritech abandonment and decommissioning work  along with the costs incurred on the significant amount of work performed during  contributed significantly to maritech recording approximately million of charges for excess decommissioning costs during the year 
in addition  the increased abandonment and decommissioning cost estimates also contributed to maritech recording a total of million of oil and gas property impairments during the year 
these charges were the most significant factors in our reporting a million net loss for other than the impact from increased regulation of offshore oil and gas operations  our businesses also continued to be affected by other factors 
our production testing segment reported improved activity levels during  as demand for us onshore services increased during the year 
maritech revenue levels were enhanced primarily as a result of strong realized oil and natural gas commodity pricing as a result of hedge derivative contracts 
however  maritech s natural gas hedge derivative contracts expired at the end of and its remaining oil hedge derivative contracts are at prices below current market prices 
the current levels of natural gas prices are expected to significantly reduce maritech s revenues and profitability going forward compared to lower natural gas prices have also continued to affect compressco s operations  as revenue and profitability decreased compared to the prior year 
while overall fluids division revenues were increased during as a result of production and sales of product from the el dorado  arkansas  calcium chloride manufacturing plant  profitability from the plant has been hampered by constrained production and resulting higher product costs per unit of production 
efforts to improve the plant s performance are ongoing  but are not expected to impact its profitability until mid consolidate d results were also affected by impairments of other long lived assets  including the lake charles  louisiana  calcium chloride manufacturing plant and certain offshore services assets  including one of its dive support vessels 
results were also affected by increased interest expense  as a significant amount of interest was capitalized during to long term construction projects 
we continue to maintain a strong balance sheet  and recent modifications to our long term debt borrowings have improved our liquidity going forward 
operating cash flows during totaled million  which was a decrease compared to operating cash flows during reflect the decreased activity level of our offshore services segment compared to its record activity levels during a large portion of our operating cash flows during the past two years has been dedicated to the extinguishment of maritech decommissioning liabilities for its offshore oil and gas properties  and this focus will continue in as discussed above  the estimated cost of future decommissioning work has increased significantly  partly as a result of increased regulations 
capital expenditures during totaled million  all of which were fund ed from operating cash flows and existing cash balances 
we continue to monitor our capital expenditure levels closely 
in particular  due to a desire to conserve and reallocate capital  we have begun to decrease our investment in maritech by suspending our search for oil and gas property acquisitions and decreasing our development activities 
in addition  we are exploring strategic alternatives to our ownership of maritech and its oil and gas properties and we are reviewing opportunities to sell maritech oil and gas property packages to industry participants and other third parties 
as part of this overall effort  a portion of maritech s properties was sold in february during the fourth quarter of  we sold million of series senior notes  using the proceeds from these borrowings to help retire million of series senior notes which were scheduled to mature in also during the fourth quarter of  we amended our bank revolving credit facility  decreasing the facility to million and extending its scheduled maturity to we continue to carry no outstanding balance on our bank credit facility as of march  with our strong cash position and borrowing capacity  we continue to review strategic acquisitions and growth opportunities for our businesses 
future demand for our products and services depends primarily on activity in the oil and gas exploration and production industry  particularly including the level of expenditures for the exploration and production of oil and gas reserves and for the plugging and decommissioning of abandoned oil and gas properties 
us onshore domestic oil and gas industry expenditures  as indicated by rig count statistics and other measures  have recently increased to late levels 
industry expenditure levels had been in decline during the past two years in response to the general uncertainty regarding availability of capital resources during the recent global recession and due to oil and natural gas price volatility 
us offshore drilling activity  which also began increasing during the first half of  was then significantly reduced as a result of the o ffshore drilling moratorium which followed the macondo oil spill 
post moratorium offshore rig counts have recently begun to increase  however  activity levels are still far below pre moratorium levels 
the growth of certain of our businesses remains hampered by the current pricing levels of natural gas  particularly as compared to crude oil 
however  we still believe that there are growth opportunities for our products and services in the us and international markets  supported primarily by increased regulatory requirements governing the abandonment and decommissioning work on aging offshore platforms and wells in the gulf of mexico  increases in technologically driven deepwater oil and gas well completions in the gulf of mexico  applications for many of our products and services in the exploitation and development of shale gas reservoirs  and increasing international oil and gas exploration and development activities 
our fluids division generates revenues and cash flows by selling clear brine completion fluids cbfs and providing filtration  water transfer  and associated products and technical engineering services to us and international exploration and production companies 
in addition  the fluids division also provides liquid and dry calcium chloride products manufactured at its production facilities or purchased from third party suppliers to a variety of markets outside the energy industry 
fluids division revenues increased during compared to the prior year  due primarily to the commencement of operation of our el dorado  arkansas  calcium chloride plant 
the el dorado plant began initial production in late and produces liquid and dry flake calcium chloride as part of our manufactured products operation 
in addition  the fluids divisi on s completion products and services business generated increased revenues  reflecting the increasing us onshore industry activity and demand for cbf products during the year 
this increase occurred despite the negative impact of the offshore drilling moratorium  which significantly decreased offshore activity during much of we estimate that the impact of the moratorium negatively affected our fluids division revenues by approximately to million during the last half of the overall outlook for the division s completion services business continues to be dependent on the level of oil and gas drilling activity  particularly in the gulf of mexico  which has remained flat or has decreased during the past several years  due largely to the maturity of the producing fields in the heavily developed portions of the gulf of mexico 
however  we anticipate continued increases in industry spending in  particularly given the current levels of crude oil prices 
also  the division is at tempting to capitalize on the current industry trend toward drilling deepwater wells that generally require greater volumes of more expensive cbfs 
in addition  we continue to pursue specific international opportunities where industry spending levels from major energy customers and national oil companies have generally been more stable 
our offshore division consists of two operating segments offshore services and maritech 
offshore services generates revenues and cash flows by performing downhole and subsea services such as plugging and abandonment  workover  and wireline services  decommissioning and certain construction services  including offshore platform removal and hurricane damage remediation  and diving services involving conventional and saturated air diving and the operation of several dive support vessels 
the services provided by the offshore services segment are marketed primarily in the gulf coast region of the us  including offshore  inland waters  and in certain onshore locations 
gulf of mexico platform decommissioning and well abandonment activity levels are driven primarily by boemre regulations  the age of producing fields  production plat forms and other structures  oil and natural gas commodity prices  sales activity of mature oil and gas producing properties  and overall oil and gas company activity levels 
recent regulations enacted by the boemre governing the timing of abandonment and decommissioning of nonproductive wells and unused offshore platforms are expected to increase the demand for the offshore services segment  perhaps significantly  over the next several years 
given the increased cost to insure offshore properties for windstorm damage coverage and to reduce the risk from future storms  many oil and gas operators  including maritech  are accelerating their plans to abandon and decommission their offshore wells and platforms 
offshore services revenues decreased by during compared to the revenue level experienced during  when increased utilization by the segment s diving  abandonment  heavy lift  and cutting services businesses as a result of the high demand following the and hurricanes  resulted in record activity levels 
for the reasons described  the offshore services segment expects strong demand for its services to continue  however  the segment anticipates its overall activity in will again be less than the record levels experienced during through maritech  the offshore division acquires  manages  explores  and develops oil and gas properties in the offshore  inland water  and onshore region of the gulf of mexico and generates revenues and cash flows from the sale of the associated oil and natural gas production volumes 
maritech periodically acquires properties for their exploration and development potential 
maritech s revenues during increased by compared to due to increased realized oil and gas commodity prices and despite decreased production volumes during the year 
the increase in realized prices was primarily due to the impact of commodity hedge derivative contracts 
however  the derivative contracts with the most favorable terms compared to current market prices expired at the end of maritech continues to perform a significant amount of plugging  abandonment  and decommissioning efforts on its offshore oil and gas properties  particularly as part of its strategy to reduce its risk from hurricanes and in response to the increased cost of windstorm insurance coverage 
maritech has historically grown its operations by acquiring and developing oil and gas property interests located in the offshore  inland waters  and onshore us gulf coast region 
however  due to a desire to conserve and reallocate capital  we have begun to decrease our investment in maritech by suspending our search for oil and gas property acquisitions and decreasing our development activities 
in addition  we are exploring strategic alternatives to our ownership of maritech and its oil and gas properties and we are reviewing opportunities to sell maritech oil and gas property packages to industry participants and other third parties 
as part of this overall effort  in late february  maritech sold a group of properties that accounted for approximately of its proved reserves as of december  our production enhancement division consists of two operating segments the production testing segment and the compressco segment 
the production testing segment generates revenues and cash flows by performing flow back pressure and volume testing of onshore and offshore oil and gas wells and by providing reservoir data necessary to enable operators to optimize production and minimize oil and gas reservoir damage 
the primary testing markets served include many of the major oil and gas basins in the united states  as well as in mexico and south america  northern africa  the middle east  and asia 
the division s production testing operations are generally driven by the demand for natural gas and oil and the resulting drilling and completion activities in the markets where the production testing segment serves 
production testing segment  s revenues increased in compared to  primarily due to increased demand in the united states 
given the continuing increase in drilling activity  we anticipate that demand for our production testing services will continue to increase in compared to compressco generates revenues and cash flows by performing wellhead compression based production enhancement services throughout most of the onshore producing regions of the united states  as well as basins in canada  mexico  south america  europe  asia  and other international locations 
demand for wellhead compression services is primarily driven by the need to boost production in certain mature gas wells with declining production 
compressco segment revenues decreased in as compared to  due to decreased demand for production enhancement services as a result of lower natural gas prices as well as from increased competition 
given the recent increases in oil and natural gas prices  we anticipate compressco s revenues and cash flows will increase modestly compared to  particularly as we also continue to seek new u 
s 
and international markets for compressco operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we make assumptions  estimates  and judgments that affect the amounts reported 
we periodically evaluate these estimates and judgments  including those related to potential impairments of long lived assets including goodwill  the collectability of accounts receivable  and the current cost of future abandonment and decommissioning obligations 
note b summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements contains the accounting policies governing each of these matters 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on future expectations which we believe are reasonable 
the fair values of large portions of our total assets and liabilities are measured using significant unobservable inputs 
the combination of these factors forms the basis f or our judgments made about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
these judgments and estimates may change as new events occur  as new information is acquired  and as changes in our operating environment are encountered 
actual results are likely to differ from our current estimates  and those differences may be material 
the following critical accounting policies reflect the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets the determination of impairment of long lived assets is conducted periodically whenever indicators of impairment are present 
if such indicators are present  the determination of the amount of impairment is based on our judgments as to the future operating cash flows to be generated from these assets throughout their estimated useful lives 
if an impairment of a long lived asset is warranted  we estimate the fair value of the asset based on a present value of these cash flows or the value that could be realized from disposing of the asset in a transaction between market participants 
the oil and gas industry is cyclical  and our estimates of the amount of future cash flows  the period over which these estimated future cash flows will be generated  as well as the fair value of an impaired asset  are imprecise 
our failure to accurately estimate the se future operating cash flows or fair values could result in certain long lived assets being overstated  which could result in impairment charges in periods subsequent to the time in which the impairment indicators were first present 
alternatively  if our estimates of future operating cash flows or fair values are understated  impairments might be recognized unnecessarily or in excess of the appropriate amounts 
our estimates of operating cash flows and fair values for assets impaired have generally been accurate 
although the majority of our impairments of long lived assets have typically related to oil and gas properties see separate discussion below  during  we recorded other long lived asset impairments of million 
given the current volatile economic environment  the likelihood of additional material impairments of long lived assets in future periods is higher due to the possibility of further decreased demand for our products and services 
impairment of goodwill the impairment of goodwill is also assessed whenever impairment indicators are present  but not less than once annually 
the assessment for goodwill impairment is performed for each reporting unit and consists of a comparison of the carrying amount of each reporting unit to our estimation of the fair value of that reporting unit 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value  an impairment loss is calculated by comparing the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill to our estimated implied fair value of that goodwill 
our estimates of reporting unit fair value are imprecise and are subject to our estimates of the future cash flows of each business and our judgment as to how these estimated cash flows translate into each business estimated fair value 
these estimates and judgments are affected by numerous factors  including the general economic environment at the time of our assessment  which affects our overall market capitalization 
if we over estimate the fair value of our reporting units  the balance of our goodwill asset may be overstated 
alternatively  if our estimated reporting unit fair values are understated  impairments might be recognized unnecessarily or in excess of the appropriate amounts 
during the fourth quarter of  due to changes in the global economic environment which affected our stock price and market capitalization  we recorded an impairment of goodwill of million 
we believe our estimates of the fair value for each reporting unit are reasonable 
however  given the current volatile economic environment  the likelihood of additional material impairments of goodwill in future periods is higher 
as of december   our offshore services  production testing  and compressco reporting units reflect goodwill in the amounts of million  million  and million  respectively 
the fair values of our offshore services and production testing reporting units significantly exceed their carrying values 
however  because the estimated fair value of our compressco reporting unit currently exceeds its carrying value by approximately  there is a reasonable possibility that compressco s goodwill may be impaired in a future period and the amount of such impairment may be material 
specific uncertainties affecting the estimated fair value of our compressco reporting unit include the prices received by compressco s customers for natural gas production  the rate of future growth of compressco s business  and the need and timing of the full resumption of the fabrication of new compressco compressor units 
in addition  compressco s mexico operations may continue to be disrupted by security issues in that country 
the demand for compressco s wellhead compression services continues to be decreased compared to early levels and negatively affected by the current economic environment 
a decrease in natural gas prices could have a further negative effect on the fair value of our compressco reporting unit 
oil and gas properties maritech accounts for its interests in oil and gas properties using the successful efforts method  whereby costs incurred to drill and equip development wells  including unsuccessful development wells  are capitalized  and costs related to unsuccessful exploratory wells are expensed as incurred 
all capitalized costs are accumulated and recorded separately for each field and are depleted on a unit of production basis  based on the estimated remaining proved oil and gas reserves of each field 
oil and gas properties are assessed for impairment in value on an individual field basis  whenever indicators become evident  with any impairment charged to expense 
accordingly  maritech s results of operations may be more volatile compared to those oil and gas exploration and production companies who account for their operations using the full cost me thod 
due to the impact of changing oil and gas prices  results of drilling and development efforts  and increased estimated decommissioning liabilities see discussion below  maritech has recorded oil and gas property impairments and dry hole costs  and during   and these impairment charges were significant 
maritech periodically purchases oil and gas properties and assumes the associated well abandonment and decommissioning liabilities 
any significant differences in the actual amounts of oil and gas production cash flows produced or decommissioning costs incurred compared to the estimated amounts recorded will affect our anticipated profitability 
given the volatility of oil and natural gas prices  we are more likely to record additional significant impairments in future periods 
the process of estimating oil and gas reserves is complex  requiring significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological  geophysical  engineering  and economic data for each reservoir 
as a result  these estimates are inherently imprecise 
actual future production  cash flows  development expenditures  operating and abandonment expenses  and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary substantially from those initially estimated by maritech 
any significant variance in these assumptions could result in significant upward or downward revisions of previous estimates  as reflected in our annual disclosure of the estimated quantity and value of our proved reserves 
in previous years  we have reflected revisions to our previous estimates of reserve quantities and values  and in some years  these revisions have b een significant 
it is possible we will have additional revisions to our estimated quantities of proved reserves in future periods 
decommissioning liabilities maritech s decommissioning liabilities are established based on what it estimates a third party would charge to plug and abandon the wells  decommission the pipelines and platforms  and clear the sites 
these well abandonment and decommissioning liabilities referred to as decommissioning liabilities are recorded net of amounts allocable to joint interest owners  anticipated insurance recoveries  and any contractual amounts to be paid by the previous owners of the property 
in estimating the decommissioning liabilities  we perform detailed estimating procedures  analysis  and engineering studies 
whenever practical  maritech settles these decommissioning liabilities by utilizing the services of its affiliated companies to perform well abandonment and decommissioning work 
this saves us the profit margin that a third party would charge for s uch services 
when these services are performed by an affiliated company  all recorded intercompany revenues are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements 
any difference between our own internal costs to settle the decommissioning liability and the recorded liability is recognized in the period in which we perform the work 
the recorded decommissioning liability associated with a specific property is fully extinguished when the property is completely abandoned 
once a maritech well abandonment and decommissioning project is performed  any remaining decommissioning liability in excess of the actual cost of the work performed is recorded as a gain and included in earnings in the period in which the project is completed 
conversely  actual costs in excess of the decommissioning liability are charged against earnings in the period in which the work is performed 
we review the adequacy of our decommissioning liabilities whenever indicators suggest that either the amount or timing of the estimated cash flows underlying the liabilities have changed materially 
the estimated timing of these cash flows is determined by the productive life of the associated oil and gas property  which is based on the property s oil and gas reserve estimates 
the amount of cash flows necessary to abandon and decommission the property is subject to changes due to seasonal demand  increased demand following hurricanes  regulatory changes  and other general changes in the energy industry environment 
accordingly  the estimation of our decommissioning liabilities is imprecise 
following the issuance by the boemre of ntl g idle iron guidance regulations and due to other factors  maritech significantly adjus ted its decommissioning liabilities as of december  largely as a result of these adjustments  as well as a result of the cost of significant abandonment and decommissioning work performed during the year  maritech recorded approximately million of increased excess decommissioning expense associated with work performed or to be performed on nonproductive oil and gas properties 
in addition  adjustments to decommissioning liabilities associated with productive properties were capitalized to oil and gas properties and contributed significantly to maritech recording approximately million of increased oil and gas property impairments during compared to the prior year 
the estimation of the decommissioning liabilities associated with the two remaining maritech offshore platforms that were destroyed during the and hurricanes is particularly difficult due to the non routine nature of the efforts required 
the actual cost of performing maritech s well abandonment and decommis sioning work has often exceeded our initial estimate of maritech s decommissioning liabilities and has resulted in charges to earnings in the period the work is performed or when the additional liability is determined 
during   and  the amount of charges to earnings as a result of costs of work performed being in excess of our estimated liabilities has been significant 
to the extent our decommissioning liabilities are understated  additional charges to earnings may be required in future periods 
revenue recognition we generate revenue on certain well abandonment and decommissioning projects under contracts which are typically of short duration and that provide for either lump sum turnkey charges or specific time  material  and equipment charges  which are billed in accordance with the terms of such contracts 
with regard to turnkey contracts  revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion method based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs at completion 
the estimation of total costs to be incurred may be imprecise due to unexpected well conditions  delays  weather  and other uncertainties 
inaccurate cost estimates may result in the revenue associated with a specific contract being recognized in an inappropriate period 
total project revenue and cost estimates for turnkey contracts are reviewed periodically as work progresses  and adjustments are reflected in the period in which such estimates are revised 
provisions for estimated losses on such contracts are made in the period such losses are determined 
despite the uncerta inties associated with estimating the total contract cost  our recognition of revenue associated with these contracts has historically been reasonable 
our production testing segment is party to a south american technical management contract which contains multiple deliverables  including the delivery of equipment and the performance of service milestones 
while the contract provides contract determined values associated with each deliverable  the recognition of revenue is determined based on the realized market values received by the customer as well as by the realizability of collections under the contract 
the determination of realized market values is supported by objective evidence whenever possible  but may also be determined based on our judgments as to the value of a particular deliverable 
bad debt reserves reserves for bad debts are calculated on a specific identification basis  whereby we estimate whether or not specific accounts receivable will be collected 
such estimates of future collectability may be incorrect  which could result in the recognition of unanticipated bad debt expenses in future periods 
a significant portion of our revenues come from oil and gas exploration and production companies  and historically our estimates of uncollectible receivables have proven reasonably accurate 
however  if due to adverse circumstances  certain customers are unable to repay some or all of the amounts owed us  an additional bad debt allowance may be required  and such amount may be material 
income taxes we provide for income taxes by taking into account the differences between the financial statement treatment and tax treatment of certain transactions 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis amounts 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date 
this calculation requires us to make certain estimates about our future operations  and many of these estimates of future operations may be i mprecise 
changes in state  federal  and foreign tax laws  as well as changes in our financial condition  could affect these estimates 
in addition  we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating income tax uncertainties 
these factors include an evaluation of the technical merits of the tax position as well as the amounts and probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate settlement 
the actual resolution of those uncertainties will inevitably differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the financial statements 
our estimates and judgments associated with our calculations of income taxes have been reasonable in the past  however  the possibility for changes in the tax laws  as well as the current economic uncertainty  could affect the accuracy of our income tax estimates in future periods 
acquisition purchase price allocations we account for acquisitions of businesses using the purchase method  which requires the allocation of the purchase price based on the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired 
we estimate the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired using accepted valuation methods  and  in many cases  such estimates are based on our judgments as to the future operating cash flows expected to be generated from the acquired assets throughout their estimated useful lives 
we have completed several acquisitions during the past several years and have accounted for the various assets including intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on our estimate of fair values 
goodwill represents the excess of acquisition purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquir ed 
our estimates and judgments of the fair value of acquired businesses are imprecise  and the use of inaccurate fair value estimates could result in the improper allocation of the acquisition purchase price to acquired assets and liabilities  which could result in asset impairments  recording of previously unrecorded liabilities  and other financial statement adjustments 
the difficulty in estimating the fair values of acquired assets and liabilities is increased during periods of economic uncertainty 
stock based compensation we estimate the fair value of share based payments of stock options using the black scholes option pricing model 
this option pricing model requires a number of assumptions  of which the most significant are expected stock price volatility  the expected pre vesting forfeiture rate  and the expected option term the amount of time from the grant date until the options are exercised or expire 
expected volatility is calculated based upon actual historical stock price movements over the most recent periods equal to the expected option term 
expected pre vesting forfeitures are estimated based on actual historical pre vesting forfeitures over the most recent periods for the expected option term 
all of these estimates are inherently imprecise and may result in compensation cost being recorded that is materially different from the actual fair value o f the stock options granted 
while the assumptions for expected stock price volatility and pre vesting forfeiture rates are updated with each year s option valuing process  there have not been significant revisions made in these estimates to date 
results of operations the following data should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the associated notes contained elsewhere in this report

offshore services segment revenues decreased by million compared to the record levels of  which saw unprecedented activity and demand 
increased onshore oil and gas industry activity during contributed to the revenue increases by our production testing and fluids divisions  with the fluids division also reflecting increased sales of manufactured products from our new el dorado  arkansas  calcium chloride plant 
maritech revenues increased largely because of higher realized oil prices  which include the impact of certain commodity derivative hedges which expired at the end of overall gross profit decreased primarily du e to million of decreased profitability from our offshore services segment  and due to significant impairments and other charges incurred by our maritech  offshore services  and fluids segments 
in addition  the gross profit of our fluids and compressco segments were also decreased compared to the prior year 
these decreases were partially offset by increased production testing gross profit 
consolidated general and administrative expenses decreased as compared to the prior year due to approximately million of decreased bad debt expenses and million of decreased insurance expenses during the current year 
these decreases were largely offset by approximately million of increased employee related costs  including increased salary  benefits  contract labor costs  and other associated employee expenses 
in addition  general and administrative expenses during include million of increased professional fees  million of increased office expenses  and million of increased taxes  investor relations  and other general expenses 
consolidated interest expense increased primarily due to a decrease in capitalized interest compared to the prior year period following the completion of significant construction projects  including the el dorado  arkansas  calcium chloride facility and our corporate headquarters building 
consolidated other income decreased during compared to the prior year  primarily due to approximately million of decreased gains on sales of assets  million of decreased legal settlement gains  million of decreased foreign currency gains  and due to the expensing of a million prepayment premium on the repayment of the senior notes 
these decreases were partially offset by million of increased earnings in an unconsolidated joint venture  primarily due to a million charge for an impairment of our fluids division european joint venture investment during in addition  we recorded million of decreased hedge ineffectiveness losses compared to the prior year 
we recorded a consolidated income tax benefit of million during due to our net loss for the period 
this compares to a consolidated tax provision of million during divisional comparisons fluids division year ended december  period to period change vs change in thousands  except percentages revenues gross profit gross profit as a percentage of revenue general and administrative expense general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue interest income expense  net other income expense  net income before taxes and discontinued operations income before taxes and discontinued operations as a percentage of revenue the increase in fluids division revenues as compared to the prior year was primarily due to million of increased product sales revenues 
this increase in product sales revenues was partially attributed to increased revenues from sales of liquid calcium chloride produced from our el dorado  arkansas  calcium chloride plant  which began production during the fourth quarter of product sales revenues also increased due to increased domestic sales volumes of clear brine fluids cbfs  particularly during the fourth quarter of domestic product sales revenues also benefitted from increased pricing compared to the prior year and due to a significant sale of bromide products during the first quarter of international product sales revenues also increased  due to improved oil and gas activity levels in certain of the foreign markets w e serve and due to increased product sales from our european calcium chloride operations 
the increase in domestic product sales revenues during occurred despite the decreased activity and pricing on product sales to domestic deepwater operators as a result of the deepwater drilling moratorium  which was in effect during a portion of the year 
although this moratorium was lifted in october  delays due to permitting and increased regulatory requirements have continued to slow the return of improved demand in the deepwater gulf of mexico 
however  cbf sales volumes increased during the fourth quarter of  and this trend may indicate that activity levels are increasing going forward 
in addition to increased product sales revenues  service revenues increased by approximately million due to increased domestic frac water and filtration service activities 
despite the increased revenues  gross profit decreased compared to the prior year primarily due to the significant losses from our domestic calcium chloride manufacturing operations 
these losses were primarily due to the million impairment of the division s lake charles  louisiana  calcium chloride plant 
due to the current market pricing for calcium chloride and the uncertain supply of raw materials needed to operate the plant on economic terms  the expected operating cash flows of the plant are insufficient to cover the plant s carrying value  resulting in the impairment 
in addition  start up costs and continuing production inefficiencies have negatively affected the profitability of our el dorado  arkansas  calcium chloride plant 
we continue to take steps to improve the operational efficiency of this plant  however  there is still considerable effort required  and significant improvement in plant performance is not expected until mid partially offsetting the significantly decreased profitability of our domestic calcium chloride manufacturing operations  gross profit on cbf sales and completion services increased approximately million  due to the increased activity levels during the current year 
in addition  gross profit from the division s european calcium chloride manufacturing operations also increased 
income before taxes decreased compared to the prior year  primarily due to the decreased gross profit discussed above and due to an increase in general and administrative expense  primarily due to increased employee related costs 
this decrease in profitability was partially offset by a significant decrease in other expense as compared to the prior year when we recorded a million charge for the impairment of the division s investment in a european unconsolidated joint venture 
partially offsetting this decrease in other expense  other income decreased as a result of decreased foreign currency gains on the division s international operations

the decreased activity resulted in reduced utilization of much of the segment s fleet as compared to the prior year period  without taking into effect the addition of a leased dive support vessel beginning in june in addition to the decreased activity for certain of the segment s operations  overall pricing levels were lower during compared to the prior year 
during  the boemre issued ntl g  the idle iron guidance regulations  which require that permanent plugs be set in nearly  nonproducing wells in the us gulf of mexico 
in addition  the new regulation requires approximately oil and gas production platforms to be dismantled if they are not being used 
we anticipate that these new requirements will increase  perhaps significantly  the future demand for well abandonment and decommissioning services to be performed by our offshore services segment 
in addition  we continue to capitalize on the remaining demand for well abandonment and decommissioning services for the remaining offshore properties that were damaged or destroyed by hurricanes 
still  we anticipate that levels of offshore services segment activity in will again be lower than the record activity levels we experienced during most of a total of million of the segment s revenues during were performed for maritech  compared with million during the prior year 
these intersegment revenues are eliminated in the consolidated statements of operations 
the decrease in gross profit was primarily due to the decreased activity and pricing  but also included the impact of decreased utilization and efficiencies compared to the prior year period 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of  the offshore services segment recorded an impairment of million to the net carrying value of the epic diver  a dive support vessel owned by our epic diving marine services subsidiary 
we determined that the vessel is no longer strategic to the segment s plan to serve its markets going forward 
in addition  the segment recorded additional impairments of approximately million during  associated with other non strategic assets 
as a result of the ntl g regulations discussed above  we anticipate that activity and profitability levels of the offshore services segment will increase c ompared to however  we expect profitability to be lower than the record high profitability levels of  due to the expected decrease in utilization rates and pricing 
the decrease in income before taxes was primarily due to the decreased gross profit discussed above 
increased general and administrative expenses include the impact of increased salaries and personnel related costs compared to the prior year 
partially offsetting these decreases  other expense during included a charge for a million legal settlement

maritech has hedged a portion of its expected future oil production levels by entering into commodity derivative hedge contracts  with certain contracts extending through  although contracts having a positive impact compared to market prices expired at the end of including the impact of its commodity derivative hedge contracts  maritech reflected average realized oil and natural gas prices during of barrel and mmbtu  respectively  each of which were significantly higher than market prices of oil and natural gas during the period 
much of the favorable hedged oil pricing impact was as a result of oil swaps that were liquidated during partially offsetting the increased realize d prices  overall production volumes decreased during the current year period  resulting in million of decreased revenues 
this decrease was attributed to natural gas production interruptions and normal production declines during the period 
a portion of maritech s main pass area production is currently shut in due to third party pipeline issues and the lack of available transportation for production 
although total oil production increased compared to the prior year period  maritech s interest in the east cameron field will continue to have a portion of its production shut in until maritech completes the redrilling of certain wells from a newly installed platform to replace the platform that was toppled during hurricane ike in recent successful development efforts at maritech s timbalier bay field are expected to result in increased production going forward 
however  since late  as a result of our efforts to conserve capital and decrease our investment in maritech  we have significantly reduced overall acquisition and development activities  and the level of such activity is expected to continue to be decreased going forward 
in february  maritech sold a portion of its oil and gas properties  which will also result in decreased revenues going forward 
in addition  maritech reported million of decreased processing revenue during despite the increased revenues  maritech s gross profit for decreased significantly compared to the prior year due to several factors 
during  maritech recorded million of additional credits to operating expense for the collection of insurance settlement proceeds  primarily from the million insurance litigation settlement in december regarding certain claims associated with damage from hurricanes katrina and rita 
in addition  partly due to the issuance by the boemre of ntl g idle iron guidance regulations in the us gulf of mexico  maritech significantly adjusted its decommissioning liabilities as of december  largely as a result of these adjustments  as well as a result of the cost of significant abandonment and decommissioning work performed during the year  maritech recorded approximately million of increased excess decommissioning expense associated with work performed or to be performed on nonproductive oil and gas properties 
in addition  adjustments to decommissioning liabilities associated with productive properties were capitalized to oil and gas properties and  along with the decreased fair value of certain oil and gas properties  contributed significantly to maritech recording approximately million of increased oil and gas property impairments during compared to the prior year 
partially offsetting these increased operating expenses were approximately million of decreased insurance expense and million of decreased repair expense  primarily due to the amount of repairs performed during associated with hurricane ike 
maritech s pretax profitability decreased during compared to  primarily due to the significant decrease in gross profit discussed above 
in addition  maritech other income decreased due to gains that were recorded during on sales of oil and gas properties 
partially offsetting these decreases  maritech general and administrative expenses decreased  primarily due to decreased bad debt expense 
production enhancement division beginning in the fourth quarter of  certain mexican production enhancement operations were reclassified from our production testing segment to our compressco segment 
segment information for prior years has been revised to conform to the presentation 
production testing segment year ended december  period to period change vs change in thousands  except percentages revenues gross profit gross profit as a percentage of revenue general and administrative expense general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue interest income expense  net other income expense  net income before taxes and discontinued operations income before taxes and discontinued operations as a percentage of revenue the increase in revenues for the production testing segment was primarily due to a million increase in domestic operations  approximately million of which was recorded during the fourth quarter of this increase reflects the increase in domestic drilling activity  which we anticipate will continue in in addition  international operations generated million of increased revenues 
approximately million of this increase was associated with a south american technical management contract 
increased international revenues were reported during due to increases in eastern hemisphere and brazil  and were partially offset by decreased activity and revenues in mexico  where customer budgetary issues  security disruptions  and regional flooding during the year have negatively affected activity levels 
the increase in gross profit was due to approximately million of increased domestic gross profit  which more than offset the approximately million decrease in international gross profit 
domestic profitability increased due to the higher activity levels and improved operating efficiencies 
while international production testing operations have historically generated higher operating margins than domestic operations  decreased activity and operating interruptions in mexico have hampered international profitability 
despite the increase in gross profit  income before taxes decreased primarily due to a million gain from a legal settlement which was recorded in the prior year 
this decrease in other income plus increased administrative costs was partially offset by the increased gross profit during the current year 
compressco segment year ended december  period to period change vs change in thousands  except percentages revenues gross profit gross profit as a percentage of revenue general and administrative expense general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue interest income expense  net other income expense  net income before taxes and discontinued operations income before taxes and discontinued operations as a percentage of revenue the decrease in compressco revenues was due to million of decreased us compression service revenues  primarily reflecting the reduced us demand for wellhead compression services during we believe the reduced demand was primarily due to continuing lower natural gas prices compared to prices during previous years  as well as due to the impact of increased competition 
compressco s domestic activity levels have begun to increase during the past three quarters  and fourth quarter of revenue levels were increased compared to the prior year period 
over the past year  many domestic oil and gas operators  including certain compressco customers  have responded to the lower gas prices by reducing operating expenses 
in addition  international service revenues also decreased by million  primarily due to decreased activity in m exico 
going forward  we anticipate that compressco s international revenues will continue to be negatively affected by conditions in mexico  where customer budgetary issues and security disruptions have negatively impacted activity levels during revenues from sales of compressor units and parts during decreased million compared to the prior year 
compressco has reduced the fabrication of new compressor units until demand for its production enhancement services increases and inventories of available units are reduced 
the decrease in gross profit was due to decreased demand domestically for compressco s products and services  as well as due to the above described decreased activity in mexico 
domestic profitability during was also affected by decreased pricing and certain non recurring operating charges during the year 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues also decreased due to the decreased activity  despite compressco s efforts to improve operating efficiencies 
the decrease in income before taxes was primarily due to the decrease in gross profit and  to a lesser extent  from increased administrative expenses  which were primarily due to increased salary and personnel related expenses 
corporate overhead year ended december  period to period change vs change in thousands  except percentages gross profit primarily depreciation expense general and administrative expense interest expense  net other expense  net income loss before taxes and discontinued operations corporate overhead includes corporate general and administrative expense  interest income and expense  and other income and expense 
such expenses and income are not allocated to our operating divisions  as they relate to our general corporate activities 
corporate overhead increased during compared to the prior year  as decreased general and administrative expenses were offset by increased interest expense and other expense 
corporate general and administrative costs decreased primarily due to approximately million of decreased salaries and employee related expenses  which was mainly due to decreased incentive compensation 
in addition  general and administrative expenses decreased due to million of decreased office expenses  million of decreased insurance and taxes expenses  million of decreased professional fee expenses  and approximately million of decreased general expenses 
these decreases were partially offset by approximately million of increased investor relations expenses 
largely offsetting this decrease  corporate interest expense increased due to a decrease in the amount of interest capitalized on construction projects during the period  particularly following the completion of the construction of the el dorado  arkansas  calcium chloride facility 
in addition  other expense increased  despite a million decrease in hedge ineffectiveness losses  due to the charge for approximately million in prepayment premium on the repayment of the senior notes

this was due to decreased revenues by each of the other reporting segments  which reflected the impact of the general decline in oil and gas industry activity during this decrease was primarily due to the global economic environment and specifically due to lower oil and natural gas commodity prices during compared to offshore services revenues increased by million due to increased demand for diving  platform decommissioning  cutting  and abandonment services during  following the damage to offshore platforms from hurricanes in the gulf of mexico in prior years and due to the risk of damage from future storms 
this increase was more than offset by significantly decreased revenue from our fluids division  which experi enced decreased demand for its products  primarily due to decreased oil and gas completion activity 
in addition  our production testing  maritech  and compressco segments also reported decreased revenues  generally due to decreased demand resulting from lower oil and gas commodity pricing 
despite these decreases  overall gross profit increased during compared to  primarily due to the unprecedented favorable performance of our offshore services segment  a favorable litigation settlement  and due to significant impairments to oil and gas properties during during the fourth quarter of  changes to the global economic environment resulting in uncertain capital markets and reductions in global economic activity had a severe impact on the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units as of december  as part of our annual test of goodwill impairment  we determined that an impairment of the goodwill of our fluids and offshore services reporting units was necessary 
accordingly  we recorded goodwill impairment charges for these segments 
consolidated general and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to approximately million of decreased salary  benefits  contract labor costs  and other associated employee expenses  primarily due to overall personnel cost reduction efforts 
this decrease was despite increased incentive bonus and equity compensation expenses 
general and administrative expenses were also decreased due to approximately million of decreased office expense  primarily from decreased office rent following the first quarter relocation to our new corporate headquarters building  approximately million of decreased professional fees  and approximately million of decreased marketing  investor relations  and other general expenses 
these decreases were partially offset by approximately million of increased insurance and property tax expenses and approximately million of increased bad debt expenses 
consolidated other income decreased primarily due to the change in hedge ineffectiveness  as we recognized approximately million of hedge ineffectiveness losses during compared to million of hedge ineffectiveness gains during the prior year 
in addition  earnings from unconsolidated joint ventures decreased million  primarily due to an impairment charge of approximately million during associated with the write down of our unconsolidated european joint venture investment 
partially offsetting these decreases  we recorded million of increased net legal settlement income  million of increased gains on sales of assets  and million of increased foreign currency gains during consolidated net interest expense decreased  despite increased borrowings of long term debt during much of the year 
the increased borrowings were used to fund our capital expenditure and working capital requirements 
the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to million of increased capitalized interest primarily associated with our arkansas calcium chloride plant and corporate headquarters construction projects 
the corporate headquarters building was completed during the first quarter of  and our calcium chloride facility in el dorado  arkansas  began initial production during the fourth quarter of accordingly  despite a decrease in the balance of long term debt outstanding as of december   our net interest expense is expected to increase beginning in since the amount of interest capitalized will be red uced 
consolidated provision for income taxes increased primarily due to increased earnings

this decrease reflects the overall decreased industry spending as reflected in the us and international rig counts during compared to and the trend of many operators during to defer completion operations on drilled oil and gas wells 
in addition  the decreased product sales revenues were due to decreased sales volumes of the division s manufactured chemicals products  primarily due to the impact of decreased economic conditions which have affected the level of activity of the division s oil and gas industry customers 
the division also reflected million of de creased service revenues  primarily due to decreased us onshore oil and gas activity 
during the fourth quarter of  the division began initial production of liquid calcium chloride from its el dorado  arkansas  plant facility 
the plant also began initial production of dry calcium chloride in early the decrease in fluids division gross profit was primarily due to the decreased sales volumes discussed above  particularly for us completion fluids products 
in addition  the fluids division recorded approximately million of impairments of long lived assets during gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased  however  due to increased international margins  particularly by the division s european calcium chloride operation 
as discussed above  the division s new el dorado  arkansas  calcium chloride plant facility began initial production during the fourth quarter of the increase in fluids division income before taxes was primarily due to a non recurring million charge for the impairment of goodwill recorded during the fourth quarter of this increase was partially offset by the million decrease in gross profit discussed above and a million charge during associated with the impairment of the division s investment in a european unconsolidated joint venture 
the joint venture ceased operation of the calcium chloride manufacturing plant following our joint venture partner s announced closure of its adjacent plant facility which supplies the joint venture s plant with feedstock raw material 
these decreases in earnings were partially offset by approximately million of decreased administrative expenses and approximately million of increased other income  which w as primarily due to a million charge for a legal settlement in the prior year period 
offshore division offshore services segment year ended december  period to period change vs change in thousands  except percentages revenues gross profit gross profit as a percentage of revenue general and administrative expense general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue impairment of goodwill interest income expense  net other income expense  net income before taxes and discontinued operations income before taxes and discontinued operations as a percentage of revenue the increase in offshore services revenues was due to increased utilization  particularly by the segment s diving  abandonment  heavy lift  and cutting services businesses  which enjoyed unprecedented high demand following the and hurricanes 
beginning in june  the segment increased its service fleet through the leasing of a specialized dive support vessel which was utilized for contracted hurricane recovery work during the remainder of the year 
in addition  many offshore oil and gas operators  including maritech  have accelerated their efforts to abandon and decommission offshore platform facilities in response to the risks from future storms and the significantly increased windstorm insurance cost for offshore properties 
many operators have discontinued or reduced their windstorm insurance coverage until premium costs decr ease or become justifiable and are seeking to maximize their abandonment and decommissioning activity in order to decrease their risk of future damage 
the increase in gross profit was primarily due to the increased gross profit of the segment s heavy lift  diving  and cutting services businesses  which generated significant efficiencies from increased utilization during these efficiencies were partially due to improved weather conditions during  as the segment incurred significant downtime during the third quarter of due to hurricanes gustav and ike 
the hurricane season from june through november can generate significant downtime in certain years 
in addition  heavy seas  winds  and winter squalls tend to disrupt activities and  therefore  reduce demand for our services in the first and fourth quarters 
also during the offshore services segment recorded an million impairment of certain long lived assets 
in addition  during the segment consolidated certain o ffice and administrative functions  reduced crews  and sold or temporarily idled selected inland water equipment in order to increase efficiencies for certain of its operations 
offshore services segment income before taxes increased due to the increase in gross profit described above and million of decreased administrative expenses  partially offset by approximately million of increased other expense  primarily due to a legal settlement during the third quarter of in addition  the offshore services segment recorded a charge to earnings of million for a goodwill impairment during the fourth quarter of maritech segment year ended december  period to period change vs change in thousands  except percentages revenues gross profit gross profit as a percentage of revenue general and administrative expense general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue interest income expense  net other income expense  net income before taxes and discontinued operations income before taxes and discontinued operations as a percentage of revenue maritech s revenues decreased during compared to the prior year due to decreased pricing and production volumes 
decreased realized commodity prices resulted in million of decreased revenues  as during maritech reflected average realized oil and natural gas prices of barrel and mmbtu  respectively  each of which was lower than levels 
maritech has hedged a portion of its expected future production levels by entering into derivative hedge contracts 
the average realized prices above include the impact of these hedge contracts during  which significantly reduced the impact of decreased prices during the year 
in addition to decreased pricing  decreased maritech production volumes resulted in decreased revenues of approximately million primarily due to one of maritech s key oil producing fields  the east cameron field  being shut in for most of the year 
the decreased production from normal production declines and the shut in properties more than offset newly added production during the period from wells drilled in and the level of maritech s drilling and development activity has decreased during as a result of our efforts to conserve capital 
partially offsetting the revenue decreases associated with decreased pricing and production volumes  maritech reported million of increased processing revenue during the current year period 
the increase in gross profit was primarily due to the million of increased insurance related gains  primarily from the million settlement of our insurance litigation regarding claims associated with damage from hurricanes katrina and rita 
the proceeds from this settlement were received during the fourth quarter of in addition  maritech recorded oil and gas property impairments of million during  compared to million during also  maritech recorded million of decreased operating expenses and depreciation  depletion  and amortization during compared to the prior year 
this decrease was primarily due to decreased production volumes and reduced insurance premium costs  following maritech s decision to self insure from windstorm damage risk during the last half of the year 
maritech also recorded million of dry hole costs during partially offsetting these expense decreases  maritech recorded million of increased excess decommissioning costs incurred during the increase in maritech income before taxes compared to the prior year was due to the increase in gross profit discussed above  approximately million of increased gains on sales of properties recorded  and approximately million of decreased administrative costs  partially offset by approximately million of decreased other income during production enhancement division production testing segment year ended december  period to period change vs change in thousands  except percentages revenues gross profit gross profit as a percentage of revenue general and administrative expense general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue interest income expense  net other income expense  net income before taxes and discontinued operations income before taxes and discontinued operations as a percentage of revenue production testing revenues decreased due to the decrease in us operations  primarily from reduced drilling activity as reflected by the us rig count 
the decreased demand also resulted in decreased day rates for our services 
the division s production testing segment is particularly affected by the activities of its us customers  many of which have been significantly affected by the current economic climate 
this decrease was partially offset by increased international revenues  primarily in mexico and brazil 
production testing gross profit decreased primarily due to an approximately million decrease in domestic gross profit due to the weaker demand  lower day rates  and decreased activity in the us in addition  gross profit from international production testing activities also decreased by approximately million 
production testing income before taxes decreased due to the million decrease in gross profit discussed above  which was partially offset by approximately million of increased other income  primarily due to a million legal settlement gain  million of increased gains on sales of assets  and million of increased other income  primarily from increased earnings from an unconsolidated joint venture

lower natural gas prices and general industry economic conditions resulted in decreased demand compared to for wellhead compression services  as reflected in compressco s reduced utilization of its gasjack compressor fleet 
beginning in early  compressco reduced the fabrication of new compressor units until demand for its production enhancement services increases and inventories of available units are reduced 
however  compressco continues to seek new niche opportunities to expand its operations  including additional opportunities in international markets 
compressco gross profit decreased primarily due to decreased activity and due to unabsorbed fabrication overhead as a result of the decreased production of new compressor units along with other increased operating expenses for compressco s us operations 
income before taxes for compressco decreased primarily due to the million of decreased gross profit discussed above  partially offset by decreased administrative costs and increased other income 
corporate overhead year ended december  period to period change vs change in thousands  except percentages gross profit primarily depreciation expense general and administrative expense interest income expense  net other income expense  net income loss before taxes and discontinued operations corporate overhead includes corporate general and administrative expense  interest income and expense  and other income and expense 
such expenses and income are not allocated to our operating divisions  as they relate to our general corporate activities 
corporate administrative costs increased primarily due to approximately million of increased salary and employee expenses 
although corporate employee salary expenses decreased due to cost reduction efforts  these decreases were more than offset by increases in company wide incentive bonus and equity compensation expense 
in addition  corporate administrative expenses increased due to approximately million of increased insurance  taxes  and other general expenses 
these administrative cost increases were partially offset by million of decreased professional services and investor re lations expense and million of decreased office expenses  primarily from decreased office rent following the first quarter relocation to our new corporate headquarters building 
in addition to increased administrative expenses  other expense increased due to million of hedge ineffectiveness losses included in other expense during compared to million of hedge ineffectiveness gains which were included in other income during in addition  corporate overhead expense increased due to million of increased depreciation expense  primarily due to our new corporate headquarters building 
partially offsetting these increases  corporate interest expense decreased during primarily due to an increase in the amount of interest capitalized on construction projects during the period 
liquidity and capital resources during the past year  we have continued to conserve capital  improve our liquidity  and maintain a strong financial position 
during the fourth quarter of  we sold million of series senior notes  using the proceeds from the offering to help retire million of series senior notes which were scheduled to mature in september in addition  we amended our bank credit facility to extend its scheduled maturity to october  which will provide a source of capital for the next five years 
we continue to fund our existing capital expenditure needs  however  from our operating cash flows 
our operating cash flows during were significantly less than  primarily due to the decreased profitability and cash flows from our offshore services segment  which enjoyed unprecedented activity levels during the prior year 
also  o perating cash flows during have been negatively affected by the current uncertain regulatory environment following the recent events in the gulf of mexico  low natural gas prices  and the effects of the continuing economic recovery 
still  the demand for the products and services of many of our businesses was improving during compared to the prior year  and this bodes well for additional growth in the capital expenditure plans for many of our businesses are also increasing from levels  and we anticipate these expenditures will again be funded primarily from operating cash flows 
however  due to a desire to conserve and reallocate capital  we have begun to decrease our investment in maritech by suspending our search for oil and gas property acquisitions and decreasing our development activities 
in addition  we are exploring strategic alternatives to our ownership of maritech and its oil and gas properties and we are reviewing opportunities to sell maritech oil and gas property packages to industry participants and other third parties 
as part of this overall effort  in late february  maritech sold a group of properties that accounted for of its proved reserves as of december  our capital conservation efforts are expected to position us so that we may continue to seek acquisition and growth opportunities that meet certain criteria  particularly internationally  either through strategic expansion of existing businesses in niche markets or through suitable acquisitions 
operating activities cash flows generated by operating activities totaled approximately million during compared to million during  a decrease of 
approximately million of current period operating cash flows were generated from insurance settlements and claims proceeds from a portion of maritech s insurance coverage related to damages suffered from hurricane ike during operating cash flows from insurance settlement collections were similarly significant during prior period operating cash flows include million from the liquidation of certain oil swap derivative contracts 
however  the decrease in operating cash flows during primarily reflects the decreased operating cash flows of our offshore services segment  which enjoyed unprecedented demand for its products and services during operating cash flows were also reduced during as a result of the regulatory uncertainty that followed the april macondo oil spill in the us gulf of mexico 
future operating cash flows for many of our businesses will also be largely dependent upon the level of oil and gas industry activity  particularly in the us gulf of mexico region 
as a result of the macondo oil spill  regulatory requirements for offshore operators  particularly deepwater operators  have increased 
we estimate that the combined impact of the recent us government imposed deepwater drilling moratorium and related regulatory issues resulted in the reduction of our consolidated revenues by approximately to million during  compared to the level of revenues we would have expected ha d the recent events in the gulf of mexico not occurred 
this decrease was experienced primarily by our fluids division  although our offshore services segment was also affected 
although the deepwater drilling moratorium was lifted in october  the impact of regulatory uncertainty is expected to continue to negatively affect the cost and timing of offshore activities in the future  perhaps significantly 
many within the oil and gas industry are expecting further increases in regulatory requirements for all us offshore drilling and production operations  particularly for deepwater projects 
operators are currently experiencing delays in permitting for deepwater as well as shallow water offshore projects 
a portion of our revenues will continue to be impacted by the current regulatory environment 
following the macondo spill and the announcement of the drilling moratorium  the us gulf of mexico offshore rig count dropped significantly  and while this offshore rig count has improved recently  it is stil l below pre macondo spill levels 
for certain of our businesses  increased government regulations could affect us positively 
however  to the extent more stringent government regulations affecting deepwater and shallow water drilling are enacted  our future revenues and operating cash flows could be negatively affected overall 
perhaps the most significant impact affecting our operations from the newly enacted regulations following the macondo oil spill is the new ntl g idle iron guidance regulation which requires that permanent plugs be set in nearly  nonproducing wells and that approximately oil and gas production platforms be dismantled if they are no longer being used 
these idle iron guidance requirements are expected to increase  possibly significantly  the future demand for the abandonment and decommissioning services of our offshore services segment 
also significantly affected is our maritech subsidiary  as the new regulatory requirement is one factor resulting in maritech significantly increasing its estimate of the decommissioning liabilities for the plugging  abandonment  and decommissioning of its oil and gas prope rties as of december  our future operating cash flow will be affected by the actual timing and amount of these decommissioning expenditures 
the estimated third party discounted fair value  including an estimated profit  of maritech s decommissioning liabilities as adjusted as of december   totals million million undiscounted 
approximately million of the cash outflow necessary to extinguish maritech s decommissioning liabilities is expected to occur during the remainder of maritech s decommissioning liabilities are expected to be extinguished in future years  as reserves are depleted 
the amount and timing of these cash outflows are estimated based on expected costs  as well as on the timing of future oil and gas production and the resulting depletion of maritech s oil and gas reserves 
such estimates are imprecise and subject to change due to changing cost estimates  further changes to boemre requirements  commodity prices  revisions of r eserve estimates  and other factors 
in addition to the impact from regulatory changes  maritech s increased decommissioning liabilities also reflect the decision to limit future development activity 
this decision results in the acceleration of the estimated timing of when abandonment and decommissioning activities on certain properties will be performed 
maritech s estimated decommissioning liabilities are net of amounts allocable to joint interest owners and any contractual amounts to be paid by the previous owners of the properties 
in some cases  the previous owners of the properties that were acquired by maritech are contractually obligated to pay maritech a fixed amount for the future well abandonment and decommissioning work on these properties as the work is performed  which partially offsets maritech s future expenditures 
as of december   maritech s total undiscounted decommissioning obligation is approximately million and consists of maritech s total liability of million plus approximately million of such contractual reimbursement arrangements with the previous owners 
while the timing and strength of the current global economic recovery continues to be difficult to predict  industry rig count and other data indicates that domestic oil and gas industry spending is increasing  spurred by the current strong pricing for crude oil and the recent trends for onshore shale gas exploitation 
still  domestic oil and gas operators activities and spending levels are significantly below early levels 
demand for a large portion of our products and services is driven by oil and gas drilling and production activity  which is affected by oil and natural gas commodity pricing 
in particular  our production testing  compressco  and fluids segments reported increased domestic activity levels during the last half of we are anticipating similar increases in revenues and cash flows for these businesses in  howe ver  these planned levels are expected to continue to be significantly below the levels generated by these businesses during the first half of our operating cash flows continue to be affected by hurricanes 
during the past two years  maritech has performed an extensive amount of well intervention  abandonment  decommissioning  debris removal  and platform construction associated with the six offshore platforms that were destroyed by hurricanes rita and ike during and  respectively 
as of december   maritech has two remaining downed platforms to be removed  and has begun redrilling certain wells at its east cameron field using a newly installed replacement platform 
until these wells are redrilled  production from the east cameron field continues to be below their pre storm levels 
the estimated cost to perform the remaining abandonment  decommissioning  debris removal  and well redrilling will be approximately to million net to our interest before any in surance recoveries 
due to the unique nature of the remaining work to be performed  actual costs could greatly exceed these estimates and  depending on the nature of any excess costs incurred  could result in significant charges to earnings in future periods 
approximately million of this amount has been accrued as part of maritech s decommissioning liabilities 
an additional amount of approximately to million relates primarily to the estimated cost to finalize the newly installed offshore platform and to complete the redrilling of the wells at the east cameron location 
following the collection of million of insurance settlement proceeds associated with hurricane ike during  maritech has additional maximum remaining insurance coverage available of approximately million  all of which relates to hurricane ike 
we anticipate that damages from hurricane ike will exceed our coverage limits for this storm 
despite our confidence that the majority of the remaining abandonme nt  decommissioning  debris removal  and well redrilling costs up to our coverage limits will qualify as covered costs pursuant to our insurance coverage  a portion of these costs may not be reimbursed 
one of the underwriters associated with our windstorm insurance coverage for hurricane ike damages has contested whether certain repair costs incurred are covered costs under the policy 
during december  we initiated legal proceedings against this underwriter in an attempt to collect the amount of claim reimbursements provided for under the policy 
also  the timing of the collection of any future reimbursements is beyond our control  and we will continue to use a significant amount of our working capital until such reimbursements are received 
the recent explosion and subsequent oil spill at the macondo well evidences the general operating risks associated with offshore oil and gas activities 
while we have no liability associated with this specific incident  we are subject to operating hazards normally associated with the oilfield service industry and offshore oil and gas production operations  including fires  explosions  blowouts  cratering  mechanical problems  abnormally pressured formations  and environmental accidents 
we maintain various types of business insurance that would be applicable in the event of an explosion or other catastrophic event involving our offshore operations 
this insurance includes third party liability  workers compensation and employers liability  general liability  vessel pollution liability  and operational risk coverage for our maritech o il and gas properties  including named windstorm damage  removal of debris  operator s extra expense  control of well  and pollution and clean up coverage 
our insurance coverage includes deductibles that must be met prior to recovery 
additionally  our insurance is subject to certain exclusions and limitations 
we believe our policy of insuring against such risks  as well as the levels of insurance we maintain  is typical in the industry 
in addition  we provide services and products in the offshore gulf of mexico generally pursuant to agreements that create insurance and indemnity obligations for both parties 
our maritech subsidiary maintains a formalized oil spill response plan that it submits to boemre 
maritech has designated employees and third party contracts in place to ensure that resources are available as required in the event of an environmental accident 
while it is impossible to anticipate every potential accident or incident involving our offshore operations  we believe we have taken appropriate steps to mitigate the potential impact of such an event on the environment in the regions in which we operate 
future operating cash flow will continue to be affected by the oil and gas prices received for maritech s production 
to minimize the risk of fluctuating oil and gas prices  maritech enters into oil and natural gas swap derivative transactions that are designated to hedge a portion of maritech s oil and gas production 
maritech s oil and natural gas swap derivative contracts during resulted in maritech receiving a fixed price for hedged natural gas production that was in excess of prices currently being received 
following the expiration of its swap derivative contracts  maritech s natural gas production is currently unhedged and its hedged oil production is fixed at prices below current oil prices 
investing activities during  we expended million of capital expenditures and other investing activities 
this level of capital expenditures was significantly reduced compared to the past several years  partially due to the completion during of our new corporate headquarters in the woodlands  texas  and our el dorado  arkansas  calcium chloride plant facility 
in light of uncertainties regarding our future operating cash flows  our capital expenditure plans have been  and will continue to be  reviewed carefully  and a significant amount of such capital expenditures have been deferred until activity levels increase 
this restraint on capital expenditure activity may also affect future growth 
in particular  prior to  we had invested significantly in maritech acquisition and development activities 
the current effort to reduce our investment in maritech includes the suspension of oil and gas property acquisition activities and the reduction of oil and gas development activities 
in addition  we are exploring strategic alternatives to our ownership of maritech and its oil and gas properties and we are reviewing opportunities to sell maritech oil and gas property packages to industry participants and other third parties 
during  our cash capital expenditures totaled approximately million 
in addition  in december  we expended million for the acquisition of certain well abandonment and wireline assets for our offshore services segment 
approximately million of our capital expenditures was expended by our fluids division  approximately million of which related to the ongoing modification of our new calcium chloride plant facility 
our offshore division expended approximately million  consisting of approximately million of acquisition  exploration and development expenditures for maritech 
in addition  the offshore division expended approximately million on its offshore services operations for costs on its various heavy lift and dive support vessels exclusive of the december acquisition 
our production enhanceme nt division spent approximately million  consisting of approximately million by the production testing segment to replace or enhance a portion of its production testing equipment fleet and approximately million by the compressco segment for general infrastructure needs  along with minimal expansion of its wellhead compressor fleet 
corporate capital expenditures were approximately million 
generally  a significant majority of our planned capital expenditures is related to identified opportunities to grow and expand our existing businesses  however  certain of these expenditures may be postponed or cancelled in our continuing efforts to conserve capital 
we plan to expend over million on total capital expenditures during this anticipated level of capital expenditure activity would result in increased spending for each of our business segments other than maritech and compressco 
the deferral of certain capital projects  such as the replacement or upgrading of vessels in our offshore services fleet  could affect our ability to compete in the future 
this restraint on capital expenditure activity may also affect future growth 
however  our long term growth strategy also continues to include the pursuit of suitable acquisition s or opportunities to establish operations in additional niche oil and gas service markets 
to the extent we consummate a significant transaction  our liquidity position will be affected 
financing activities to fund our capital and working capital requirements  we may supplement our existing cash balances and cash flow from operating activities as needed from long term borrowings  short term borrowings  equity issuances  and other sources of capital 
bank credit facilities on october   we amended our existing bank revolving credit facility agreement with a syndication of banks  whereby the credit facility was decreased from million to million and its scheduled maturity was extended from june to october in addition  the amended credit facility agreement allows us to increase the facility by million up to a million limit upon the agreement of the lenders and the satisfaction of certain conditions 
as of march   we did not have any outstanding balance on the amended revolving credit facility and had million in letters of credit and guarantees against the million amended revolving credit facility  leaving a net availability of million 
under the amended credit facility agreement the credit agreement  the revolving credit facility remains unsecured and guaranteed by certain of our material us subsidiaries 
borrowings generally bear interest at the british bankers association libor rate plus to  depending on one of our financial ratios 
we pay a commitment fee ranging from to on unused portions of the facility 
similar to the previous terms  the credit agreement contains customary covenants and other restrictions  including certain financial ratio covenants involving our levels of debt and interest cost compared to a defined measure of our operating cash flows over a twelve month period 
in addition  the credit agreement includes limitations on aggregate asset sales  individual acquisitions  and aggregate annual acquisitions and capital expenditures 
ac cess to our revolving credit line is dependent upon our ability to comply with the certain financial ratio covenants set forth in the credit agreement  as discussed above 
significant deterioration of the financial ratios could result in a default under the credit agreement and  if not remedied  could result in termination of the agreement and acceleration of any outstanding balances 
the credit agreement also includes cross default provisions relating to any other indebtedness greater than a defined amount 
if any such indebtedness is not paid or is accelerated and such event is not remedied in a timely manner  a default will occur under the credit agreement 
our credit agreement also contains a covenant that restricts us from paying dividends in the event of a default or if such payment would result in an event of default 
we are in compliance with all covenants and conditions of our credit agreement as of december  our continuing ability to comply with these financial covenants depends largely upon our ability to generate adequate cash flow 
historically  our financial performance has been more than adequate to meet these covenants and we expect this trend to continue

the note purchase agreement and the master note purchase agreement also contain customary default provisions as well as a cross default provision relating to any other of our indebtedness of m illion or more

other sources in addition to the aforementioned revolving credit facility  we fund our short term liquidity requirements from cash generated by operations  from short term vendor financing and  to a lesser extent  from leasing with institutional leasing companies 
should additional capital be required  we believe that we have the ability to raise such capital through the issuance of additional debt or equity 
however  instability or volatility in the capital markets at the times we need to access capital may affect the cost of capital and the ability to raise capital for an indeterminable length of time 
as discussed above  our credit agreement matures in and our senior notes mature at various dates between april and december the replacement of these capital sources at similar or more favorable terms is not certain 
if it is necessary to utilize equity to fund our capital needs  dilution to our common stockholders could occur 
in november  we filed a universal shelf registration statement on form s that permits us to issue an indeterminate amount of securities including common stock  preferred stock  senior and subordinated debt securities  warrants  and units

commitments and contingencies litigation we are named defendants in several lawsuits and respondents in certain governmental proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business 
while the outcome of lawsuits or other proceedings against us cannot be predicted with certainty  management does not reasonably expect these matters to have a material adverse impact on the financial statements 
class action lawsuit between march   and april   two putative class action complaints were filed in the united states district court for the southern district of texas houston division against us and certain former officers by certain stockholders on behalf of themselves and other stockholders who purchased our common stock between january   and october  the complaints assert claims under sections b and a of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and rule b promulgated thereunder 
on may   the court consolidated these complaints as in re tetra technologies  inc securities litigation  no

derivative lawsuit between may  and june   two petitions were filed by alleged stockholders in the district courts of harris county  texas  rd and th judicial districts  purportedly on our behalf 
the suits name our directors and certain officers as defendants 
the factual allegations in these lawsuits mirror those in the class action lawsuit  and the claims are for breach of fiduciary duty  unjust enrichment  abuse of control  gross mismanagement  and waste of corporate assets

on september   the plaintiffs in this state court action filed a consolidated petition which makes factual allegations similar to the surviving allegations in the federal lawsuit 
on april   the court granted our motion to abate the suit  based on plaintiff s inability to demonstrate derivative standing 
on june   we received a letter from plaintiff s counsel demanding that our board of directors take action against the defendants named in the previously filed derivative lawsuit 
our board is curren tly evaluating the best course of action to take in response to the demand letter 
at this stage  it is impossible to predict the outcome of these proceedings or their impact upon us 
we continue to believe that the allegations made in the derivative lawsuits are without merit  and we intend to seek dismissal of and vigorously defend against this lawsuit 
while a successful outcome cannot be guaranteed  we do not reasonably expect this lawsuit to have a material adverse effect

in august of  the environmental protection agency epa  pursuant to sections and of the clean water act cwa  served a request for information with regard to a release of zinc bromide that occurred from one of our transport barges on the mississippi river on march  we timely filed a response to that request for information in august in january  the epa issued a notice of violation and opportunity to show cause related to the spill 
we met with the epa in april to discuss potential violations and penalties 
it has been agreed that no injunctive relief will be required 
we have finalized a joint stipulation of settlement with the epa whereby we are responsible for a penalty of  which has been submitted to the department of justice for approval 
we expect to pay this penalty amount during the second qu arter of and expect the full amount to be covered by insurance 
product purchase obligations in the normal course of our fluids division operations  we enter into supply agreements with certain manufacturers of various raw materials and finished products 
some of these agreements have terms and conditions that specify a minimum or maximum level of purchases over the term of the agreement 
other agreements require us to purchase the entire output of the raw material or finished product produced by the manufacturer 
our purchase obligations under these agreements apply only with regard to raw materials and finished products that meet specifications set forth in the agreements 
we recognize a liability for the purchase of such products at the time we receive them 
as of december   the aggregate amount of the fixed and determinable portion of the purchase obligation pursuant to our fluids division s supply agreements was approxi mately million  extending through other contingencies related to its acquired interests in oil and gas properties  our maritech subsidiary estimates the third party fair values including an estimated profit to plug and abandon wells  decommission the pipelines and platforms  and clear the sites  and uses these estimates to record maritech s decommissioning liabilities  net of amounts allocable to joint interest owners and any amounts contractually agreed to be paid in the future by the previous owners of the properties 
in some cases  previous owners of acquired oil and gas properties are contractually obligated to pay maritech a fixed amount for the future well abandonment and decommissioning work on these properties as such work is performed 
as of december   maritech s decommissioning liabilities are net of approximately million for such future reimbursements from these previous owners 
contractual obligations the table below summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of december  payments due total thereafter in thousands long term debt interest on debt purchase obligations decommissioning and other asset retirement obligations operating and capital leases total contractual cash obligations decommissioning liabilities related to oil and gas properties generally must be satisfied within twelve months after a property s lease expires 
lease expiration generally occurs six months after the last producing well on the lease ceases production 
we have estimated the timing of these payments based upon anticipated lease expiration dates  which are subject to many changing variables  including the estimated life of the producing oil and gas properties  which is affected by changing oil and gas commodity prices 
the amounts shown represent the undiscounted obligation as of december  amounts exclude other long term liabilities reflected in our consolidated balance sheet that do not have known payment streams 
these excluded amounts include approximately million of liabilities under fasb codification topic  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlements 
see note f income taxes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
approximately million of the amounts expected to be paid in represent well abandonment  decommissioning  and debris removal related to offshore platforms destroyed in the and hurricanes  net of anticipated insurance recoveries 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb published accounting standards update asu  revenue recognition topic  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  which establishes the accounting and reporting guidance for arrangements under which service providers will perform multiple revenue generating activities 
specifically  this guidance addresses how to separate deliverables and how to measure and allocate arrangement consideration to one or more units of accounting 
additional disclosures of multiple deliverable arrangements will also be required 
asu is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  early adoption is permitted 
the adoption of the accounting and disclosure requirements of this as u will not have a significant impact on our financial statements 
in january  the fasb published asu  fair value measurements and disclosures topic  improving disclosures about fair value measurements  which requires new disclosures about transfers in and out of fair value hierarchy levels  requires more detailed disclosures about activity in level fair value measurements  and clarifies existing disclosure requirements about asset and liability aggregation  inputs  and valuation techniques 
the new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosures are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the disclosure requirements of activity in level fair value measurements  which become effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
the adoption of the disclosu re requirements of this asu did not have a significant impact on our financial statements  and the disclosure requirements of activity in level fair value measurements will not have a significant impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk any balances outstanding under the floating rate portion of our bank credit facility are subject to market risk exposure related to changes in applicable interest rates 
we borrow funds pursuant to our bank credit facility as necessary to fund our capital expenditure requirements and certain acquisitions 
these instruments carry interest at an agreed upon percentage rate spread above libor 
we had no balance outstanding under our bank credit facility as of december  accordingly  as of that date  there are no long term debt obligations which bear a variable rate of interest 
exchange rate risk we are exposed to fluctuations between the us dollar and the euro with regard to our euro denominated operating activities 
in september  we borrowed euros to fund the acquisition of our european calcium chloride assets 
we entered into long term euro denominated borrowings  in order to provide a natural currency hedge for our euro based operating cash flow 
in december  we repaid our euro denominated debt and currently have no currency hedge for our euro denominated operations 
in our european operations  we continue to have exposure related to revenues  expenses  operating receivables  and payables denominated in euros  as well as other currencies  however  such transactions are not pursuant to long term contract terms  and the amount of such foreign currency exposure is not determinable or considered material 
we also have operation s in other foreign countries in which we have exposure to the fluctuation between the local currencies in those markets and the us dollar 
we currently have no hedges in place with regard to these currencies 
commodity price risk we have market risk exposure in the pricing applicable to our oil and gas production 
realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot prices in the us natural gas market 
historically  prices received for oil and gas production have been volatile and unpredictable  and such price volatility is expected to continue 
our risk management activities involve the use of derivative financial instruments  such as swap agreements  to hedge the impact of market price risk exposures for a portion of our oil and gas production 
we are exposed to the volatility of oil and gas prices for the portion of our oil and gas production that is not hedged 
net of the impact of the crude oil hedges as of december   described below  each per barrel decrease in future crude oil prices would result in a decrease in after tax earnings of million 
as of december   we have no natural gas hedges  therefore  each decrease in future gas prices of per mcf would result in a decrease in after tax earnings of million 
fasb codification topic  derivatives and hedging  requires companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets and liabilities  measured at fair value 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting 
as of december  and  we had the following cash flow hedging swap contracts outstanding relating to a portion of our maritech subsidiary s oil and gas production commodity contracts aggregate daily volume weighted average contract price contract year december  oil swaps  barrels day barrel december  oil swaps  barrels day barrel natural gas swaps  mmbtu day mmbtu each oil and gas swap contract uses the nymex wti west texas intermediate oil price and the nymex henry hub natural gas price as the referenced price 
based upon an average nymex strip price over the remaining contract term of barrel  the market value of our oil swaps liability at december   was million 
a increase in the future price of oil would result in the market value of the combined oil derivative liability increasing by million 
the market value associated with the oil swap contract is reflected as a current liability as of december   in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
based upon an average nymex strip price over the remaining contract term of barrel  the market value of our oil swaps liability at december  was million 
a increase in the future price of oil would result in the market value of the combined oil derivative liability increasing by million 
based on an average nymex strip price over the remaining contract term of mmbtu  the market value of our natural gas swaps asset at december  was million 
a increase in the future price of natural gas would result in the market value of the combined natural gas derivative asset decreasing by million 
as of december   the market value associated with the natural gas swap contracts is reflected as a current asset  and the market value associated with the oil swap contracts is reflected as a current liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet
