item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this section provides management s discussion of chesapeake and its consolidated subsidiaries  with specific information on results of operations  liquidity and capital resources  as well as discussion on how certain accounting principles affect our financial statements 
it includes management s interpretation of financial results of the company and its operating segments  the factors affecting these results  the major factors expected to affect future operating results as well as investment and financing plans 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
several factors exist that could influence our future financial performance  some of which are described in item a  risk factors 
they should be considered in connection with forward looking statements contained in this report  or otherwise made by or on behalf of us  since these factors could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from those set out in such forward looking statements 
the following discussions and those later in the document on operating income and segment results include use of the term gross margin 
gross margin is determined by deducting the cost of sales from operating revenue 
cost of sales includes the purchased cost of natural gas  electricity and propane and the cost of labor spent on direct revenue producing activities 
gross margin should not be considered an alternative to operating income or net income  which are determined in accordance with gaap 
we believe that gross margin  although a non gaap measure  is useful and meaningful to investors as a basis for making investment decisions 
it provides investors with information that demonstrates the profitability achieved by the company under its allowed rates for regulated energy operations and under its competitive pricing structure for unregulated natural gas marketing  and propane distribution operations 
chesapeake s management uses gross margin in measuring its business units performance and has historically analyzed and reported gross margin information publicly 
other companies may calculate gross margin in a different manner 
in addition  certain information is presented  which  for comparison purposes  includes only fpu s results of operations or exclude fpu s results from the consolidated results of operations for the periods from the merger closing october  to december  and in certain other information is presented  which  for comparison purposes  excludes all merger related costs incurred in connection with the fpu merger 
although the non gaap measures are not intended to replace the gaap measures for evaluation of chesapeake s performance  we believe that the portions of the presentation which include only the fpu results  or which exclude fpu s financial results for the post merger period and merger related costs provide a helpful comparative basis for investors to understand chesapeake s performance 
the following discussion sometimes refers to legacy chesapeake and words of similar import 
such terms and phrases mean our results  excluding the impacts from the fpu merger and merger related costs a introduction chesapeake is a diversified utility company engaged  directly or through subsidiaries  in regulated energy businesses  unregulated energy businesses  and other unregulated businesses  including advanced information services

on october   we completed a merger with fpu 
the merger increased our overall presence in florida by adding approximately  natural gas distribution customers and  propane distribution customers to our existing natural gas and propane distribution operations in florida 
we also now serve approximately  electric distribution customers in northwest and northeast florida as a result of the merger 
fpu s results have been included in our consolidated results since the completion of the merger 
excluding the impacts from the fpu merger and merger related costs  our diluted earnings per share from legacy chesapeake businesses increased by percent and six percent in and  respectively  compared to the respective prior year 
the following is a summary of key factors affecting our businesses and their impacts on our results 
more detailed discussion and analysis are provided in the results of operations section 
since fpu s results for the period prior to the merger were not included in our results  the year over year variances resulting from the factors described below as they relate to fpu are limited to the period after the merger 
weather 
we measure weather based on the number of heating degree days hdd for the natural gas and propane distribution operations and the number of hdd and the number of cooling degree days cdd for the electric distribution operation 
we use historical averages as the normal weather for this analysis 
hdd on the delmarva peninsula in increased by  or two percent  compared to  and by  or seven percent  compared to normal 
hdd on the delmarva peninsula in increased by  or seven percent  compared to  and by  or six percent  compared to normal 
we estimate that colder weather contributed approximately  and million in additional gross margin for our delmarva natural gas and propane distribution operations in and  respectively  compared to the respective prior year 
we also estimate that the effect of the colder than normal temperatures on the delmarva peninsula in was increased gross margin of million for our delmarva natural gas and propane distribution operations 
chesapeake utilities corporation form k page 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis the colder temperatures in in florida produced average hdd that were  or percent  higher than and  or percent  higher than normal 
the average hdd in and were fairly consistent and did not fluctuate significantly from the normal weather 
the warmer temperatures in the summer of also produced average cdd for the year that were  or three percent  higher than the prior year and  or five percent  higher than normal 
we estimate that colder weather in the winter months and warmer weather in the summer months contributed approximately million in additional gross margin for our florida natural gas and electric distribution operations in  compared to growth 
despite the continued slowdown in growth and overall economic conditions on the delmarva peninsula  our delmarva natural gas distribution operations achieved two percent growth in average residential customers in both and  compared to the respective prior year 
these growth rates exceeded the industry s growth rates 
in addition to the residential growth  in  our delmarva natural gas distribution operations added large commercial and industrial customers with total expected annual margin of  as they were able to convert these customers to natural gas from other energy sources due to the pricing advantage of natural gas and its environmentally friendly features 
in total  customer growth for the delmarva natural gas distribution operations generated additional margin of million and million in and  respectively  compared to the respective prior year 
the addition of certain industrial customers in also positioned us to further extend our natural gas distribution and transmission infrastructure in southern delaware to serve other potential customers in the same area 
esng continued to expand its infrastructure and add new transportation services 
the additional margin generated from the continued expansions and new services  net of the expired services  was million and million in and  respectively  compared to the respective prior year 
although not affecting our results in  esng completed the eight mile mainline extension in december to interconnect with the tetlp pipeline 
esng commenced its new transportation services to chesapeake s delaware and maryland divisions in january the new transportation services have a three year phase in from  mcfs per day to  mcfs per day  providing estimated annualized margin of million in  million in and million thereafter 
fpu s natural gas distribution operation experienced growth in commercial and industrial customers in  which contributed  in additional margin in chesapeake s florida natural gas distribution division experienced a slight growth in customers in after experiencing a net customer loss in  including a loss of three large industrial customers  in florida in late and  which decreased its margin by  in compared to customer growth in the florida electric and propane distribution operations was flat 
rates and regulatory matters 
on january   new rates for chesapeake s florida natural gas distribution division became effective 
the new rates for chesapeake s florida natural gas distribution division represented an annual rate increase of approximately million and generated million in increased margin in  net of the impact from the interim rates in  compared to an annual rate increase of approximately million for fpu s natural gas distribution operation pursuant to the settlement agreement also became effective on january  the florida psc previously issued an order in may  approving a rate increase for fpu s natural gas distribution operation 
the subsequent protest by the office of public counsel of florida led to this settlement agreement between the office of public counsel and fpu  which the florida psc approved in december chesapeake utilities corporation form k page 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis the merger with fpu and the purchase of the operating assets of igc resulted in approximately million in purchase premium  which we intend to seek the recovery through rates 
we also intend to seek the recovery of approximately million in merger related costs attributed to the natural gas operations 
our florida natural gas distribution operations are required to submit to the florida psc by april  data that details benefits  synergies  cost savings and cost increases resulting from the merger 
we are currently in the process of discussing with the office of public counsel and the florida psc staff the benefits and cost savings resulted from the merger  current and expected operating results of the regulated operations in florida  and recovery of the purchase premium and merger related costs 
our results in reflect an accrual of  by fpu s natural gas distribution operation for the regulatory risk associated with its earnings  merger benefits and recovery of purchase premium and merger related costs 
also reflected in our results were approximately  of the costs associated with these discussions  which were expensed in although not affecting our results in  esng filed a proposed rate increase with the ferc on december  esng expects this base rate proceeding to be completed in esng expensed approximately  in costs associated with this filing in propane prices 
a sharp decline in propane prices in the winter months when our propane inventory is at its highest level exposes us to inventory valuation risk as gaap requires us to re value the propane inventory using the lower of cost or market approach 
we have implemented various propane supply and inventory strategies to hedge such risk 
in late  a sharp decline in propane prices resulted in inventory and swap valuation adjustments of million in  which lowered the propane inventory cost of our delmarva propane distribution operation during the first half of the absence of similar inventory valuation adjustments in and increased margin generated from the low propane cost during the first half of  coupled with sustained retail prices  contributed to increased gross margin of million in compared to for the delmarva propane distribution operation 
retail margins returned to more normal levels in continued lack of volatility in wholesale propane prices reduced the opportunities for our propane wholesale marketing subsidiary  xeron  and decreased its trading volume by percent and percent in and  respectively  compared to the respective prior year 
the lower volumes reduced gross margin by approximately  and million for and  respectively  over the prior year 
natural gas spot sale opportunities 
our unregulated natural gas marketing subsidiary  pesco  entered into spot sales in with a refinery on the delmarva peninsula  which contributed significantly to pesco s gross margin increase of million in the absence of spot sales opportunities to the same customer in reduced pesco s margin in  compared to spot sales are not predictable  and  therefore  are not included in our long term financial plans or forecasts 
interest rates 
we continued to experience low short term interest rates throughout and as our short term weighted average interest rate approximated percent in  percent in  and percent in the level of our short term borrowings in increased over as we used a new short term term loan facility to finance the redemption of million of fpu s percent and percent secured first mortgage bonds prior to their respective maturities 
the level of our short term borrowings in was reduced by the placement of million of percent unsecured senior notes in october and a decline in working capital requirements due to lower commodity prices  lower trading volume by the propane wholesale marketing subsidiary  lower income tax payments from bonus depreciation and the timing of our capital expenditures

our advanced information services subsidiary  bravepoint  generated  in operating income in  compared to an operating loss of  in increased billable consulting hours in and cost containment actions implemented throughout contributed to the increased operating results 
c critical accounting policies we prepare our financial statements in accordance with gaap 
application of these accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingencies during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
since most of our businesses are regulated and the accounting methods used by these businesses must comply with the requirements of the regulatory bodies  the choices available are limited by these regulatory requirements 
in the normal course of business  estimated amounts are subsequently adjusted to actual results that may differ from estimates 
management believes that the following policies require significant estimates or other judgments of matters that are inherently uncertain 
these policies and their application have been discussed with our audit committee 
regulatory assets and liabilities as a result of the ratemaking process  we record certain assets and liabilities in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  regulated operations  consequently  the accounting principles applied by our regulated energy businesses differ in certain respects from those applied by the unregulated businesses 
costs are deferred when there is a probable expectation that they will be recovered in future revenues as a result of the regulatory process 
as more fully described in item under the heading notes to the consolidated financial statements note a  summary of accounting policies  we have recorded regulatory assets of million and regulatory liabilities of million  at december  if we were required to terminate application of this topic  we would be required to recognize all such deferred amounts as a charge or a credit to earnings  net of applicable income taxes 
such an adjustment could have a material effect on our results of operations 
valuation of environmental assets and liabilities as more fully described in item under the heading notes to the consolidated financial statements note p  environmental commitments and contingencies  we have completed our responsibilities related to one environmental site and are currently participating in the investigation  assessment or remediation of seven other former mgp sites 
amounts have been recorded as environmental liabilities and associated environmental regulatory assets based on estimates of future costs provided by independent consultants 
there is uncertainty in these amounts  because the united states environmental protection agency epa  or other applicable state environmental authority  may not have selected the final remediation methods 
in addition  there is uncertainty with regard to amounts that may be recovered from other potentially responsible parties 
since we believe that recovery of these expenditures  including any litigation costs  is probable through the regulatory process  we have recorded a regulatory asset and corresponding environmental liability 
at december   we have recorded environmental regulatory and other assets of million and a liability of million for environmental costs

table of contents management s discussion and analysis derivatives we use derivative and non derivative instruments to manage the risks related to obtaining adequate supplies and the price fluctuations of natural gas  electricity and propane 
we also use derivative instruments to engage in propane marketing activities 
we continually monitor the use of these instruments to ensure compliance with our risk management policies and account for them in accordance with appropriate gaap 
if these instruments do not meet the definition of derivatives or are considered normal purchases and sales  they are accounted for on an accrual basis of accounting 
the following is a review of our use of derivative instruments at december  and during and  our natural gas distribution  electric distribution  propane distribution and natural gas marketing operations entered into physical contracts for the purchase or sale of natural gas  electricity and propane 
these contracts either did not meet the definition of derivatives as they did not have a minimum requirement to purchase sell or were considered normal purchases and sales as they provided for the purchase or sale of natural gas  electricity or propane to be delivered in quantities expected to be used and sold by our operations over a reasonable period of time in the normal course of business 
accordingly  these contracts were accounted for on an accrual basis of accounting 
during and  the propane distribution operation entered into a put option to protect it from the impact of price decreases on the pro cap propane price cap plan that we offer to customers 
we accounted for the put option on a mark to market basis and recorded a loss of  and  at december  and  respectively 
xeron  our propane wholesale marketing subsidiary  enters into forward  futures and other contracts that are considered derivatives 
these contracts are marked to market  using prices at the end of each reporting period  and unrealized gains or losses are recorded in the consolidated statement of income as revenue or expense 
these contracts generally mature within one year and are almost exclusively for propane commodities 
for the years ended december  and  these contracts had net unrealized gains of  and net unrealized losses of million  respectively 
operating revenues revenues for our natural gas and electric distribution operations are based on rates approved by the pscs of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
the natural gas transmission operation s revenues are based on rates approved by the ferc 
customers base rates may not be changed without formal approval by these commissions 
the pscs  however  have authorized our regulated operations to negotiate rates  based on approved methodologies  with customers that have competitive alternatives 
the ferc has also authorized esng to negotiate rates above or below the ferc approved maximum rates  which customers can elect as an alternative to negotiated rates 
for regulated deliveries of natural gas and electricity  we read meters and bill customers on monthly cycles that do not coincide with the accounting periods used for financial reporting purposes 
we accrue unbilled revenues for natural gas and electricity that have been delivered  but not yet billed  at the end of an accounting period to the extent that they do not coincide 
in connection with this accrual  we must estimate amounts of natural gas and electricity that have not been accounted for on our delivery systems and must estimate the amount of the unbilled revenue by jurisdiction and customer class 
a similar computation is made to accrue unbilled revenues for propane customers with meters  such as community gas system customers  and natural gas marketing customers  whose billing cycles do not coincide with the accounting periods 
the propane wholesale marketing operation records trading activity for open contracts on a net mark to market basis in our statement of income 
for certain propane distribution customers without meters and advanced information services customers  we record revenue in the period the products are delivered and or services are rendered 
chesapeake utilities corporation form k page 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis each of our natural gas distribution operations in delaware and maryland  our bundled natural gas distribution service in florida and our electric distribution operation in florida has a purchased fuel cost recovery mechanism 
this mechanism provides us with a method of adjusting billing rates to customers to reflect changes in the cost of purchased fuel 
the difference between the current cost of fuel purchased and the cost of fuel recovered in billed rates is deferred and accounted for as either unrecovered purchased fuel costs or amounts payable to customers 
generally  these deferred amounts are recovered or refunded within one year 
we charge flexible rates to industrial interruptible customers on our natural gas distribution systems to compete with the price of alternative fuel that they can use 
neither we nor any of our interruptible customers is contractually obligated to deliver or receive natural gas on a firm service basis 
allowance for doubtful accounts an allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded against amounts due to reduce the net receivable balance to the amount we reasonably expect to collect based upon our collections experiences  the condition of the overall economy and our assessment of our customers inability or reluctance to pay 
if circumstances change  however  our estimate of the recoverability of accounts receivable may also change 
circumstances which could affect our estimates include  but are not limited to  customer credit issues  the level of natural gas  electricity and propane prices and general economic conditions 
accounts are written off once they are deemed to be uncollectible 
pension and other postretirement benefits pension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by numerous assumptions and estimates including the market value of plan assets  estimates of the expected returns on plan assets  assumed discount rates  the level of contributions made to the plans  and current demographic and actuarial mortality data 
the assumed discount rates and the expected returns on plan assets are the assumptions that generally have the most significant impact on the pension costs and liabilities 
the assumed discount rates  the assumed health care cost trend rates and the assumed rates of retirement generally have the most significant impact on our postretirement plan costs and liabilities 
additional information is presented in item under the heading notes to the consolidated financial statements note m  employee benefit plans  including plan asset investment allocation  estimated future benefit payments  general descriptions of the plans  significant assumptions  the impact of certain changes in assumptions  and significant changes in estimates 
the total pension and other postretirement benefit costs included in operating income were million   and  in  and  respectively 
we expect to record pension and postretirement benefit costs of approximately million for  of which  are settlement losses related to lump sum distributions we expect to make during  from the chesapeake pension plan and the chesapeake serp related to the retirement of our former chief executive officer  who retired in january actuarial assumptions affecting include expected long term rates of return on plan assets of percent and percent for chesapeake s pension plan and fpu s pension plan  respectively  and discount rates of percent and percent for chesapeake s plans and fpu s plans  respectively 
the discount rate for each plan was determined by management considering high quality corporate bond rates based on moody s aa bond index  the citigroup yield curve  changes in those rates from the prior year  and other pertinent factors  such as the expected lives of the plans and the lump sum payment option 
actual changes in the fair value of plan assets and the differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets could have a material effect on the amount of pension and postretirement benefit costs that we ultimately recognize 
a percent increase in the discount rate could decrease our pension and postretirement costs by approximately  and a decrease of percent could increase our pension and postretirement costs by  a percent increase in the rate of return would decrease our pension cost by approximately  and a decrease of percent could increase our pension cost by approximately  and will not have an impact on postretirement and serp plans because these plans are not funded

table of contents management s discussion and analysis acquisition accounting the merger with fpu and other acquisitions were accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting  with chesapeake treated as the acquirer 
the acquisition method of accounting requires  among other things  that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the merger be recognized at their fair value as of the acquisition date 
it also establishes that the consideration transferred be measured at the closing date of the merger at the then current market price 
fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
in addition  market participants are assumed to be buyers and sellers in the principal or the most advantageous market for the asset or liability and fair value measures for an asset assume the highest and best use by those market participants  rather than our intended use of those assets 
in estimating the fair value of the assets and liabilities subject to rate regulation  we considered the nature of the assets and liabilities and the regulatory mechanism for recovery  to which these assets and liabilities are subject  as a factor in determining their appropriate fair value 
we also considered the existence of a regulatory process that would allow  or sometimes require  regulatory assets and liabilities to be established to offset the fair value adjustment to certain assets and liabilities subject to rate regulation 
if a regulatory asset or liability should be established to offset the fair value adjustment based on the current regulatory process  as was the case for fuel contracts and long term debt  we did not gross up our balance sheet to reflect the fair value adjustment and corresponding regulatory asset liability  because such gross up would not have resulted in a change to our value of net assets and future earnings 
the acquisition method of accounting also requires acquisition related costs to be expensed in the period in which those costs are incurred  rather than including them as a component of consideration transferred 
it also prohibits an accrual of certain restructuring costs at the time of the merger for the acquiree 
as we intend to seek recovery in future rates in florida of a certain portion of the purchase premium paid and merger related costs incurred  we also considered the impact of asc topic  regulated operations  in determining proper accounting treatment for the merger related costs 
we deferred a certain portion of the total costs incurred as a regulatory asset  which represents our best estimate of the costs  which we expect to be permitted to recover when we complete the appropriate rate proceedings based on similar proceedings in florida in the past 
the remaining costs have been expensed

fpu s natural gas and electric distribution operations had million in gross margin for the period from the merger closing october  to december   which contributed to this increase 
the natural gas distribution operations for the delmarva peninsula generated an increase in gross margin of million in the factors contributing to this increase were as follows the delmarva natural gas distribution operations experienced growth in residential  commercial  and industrial customers  which contributed   and  respectively  to the gross margin increase  in spite of the continued slowdown in the new housing construction and industrial growth in the region

our energy businesses are weather sensitive and seasonal 
we generate a large portion of our annual net income and subsequent increases in our accounts receivable in the first and fourth quarters of each year due to significant volumes of natural gas and propane delivered by our natural gas and propane distribution operations to customers during the peak heating season

our propane distribution business is exposed to market risk as a result of propane storage activities and entering into fixed price contracts for supply 
we can store up to approximately six million gallons including leased storage and rail cars of propane during the winter season to meet our customers peak requirements and to serve metered customers 
decreases in the wholesale price of propane may cause the value of stored propane to decline 
to mitigate the impact of price fluctuations  we have adopted a risk management policy that allows the propane distribution operation to enter into fair value hedges or other economic hedges of our inventory 
our propane wholesale marketing operation is a party to natural gas liquids forward contracts  primarily propane contracts  with various third parties 
these contracts require that the propane wholesale marketing operation purchase or sell natural gas liquids at a fixed price at fixed future dates 
at expiration  the contracts are settled by the delivery of natural gas liquids to us or the counterparty or booking out the transaction 
booking out is a procedure for financially settling a contract in lieu of the physical delivery of energy 
the propane wholesale marketing operation also enters into futures contracts that are traded on the new york mercantile exchange 
in certain cases  the futures contracts are settled by the payment or receipt of a net amount equal to the difference between the current market price of the futures contract and the original contract price  however  they may also be settled by physical receipt or delivery of propane

table of contents management s discussion and analysis i competition our natural gas and electric distribution operations and our natural gas transmission operation compete with other forms of energy including natural gas  electricity  oil and propane 
the principal competitive factors are price and  to a lesser extent  accessibility 
our natural gas distribution operations have several large volume industrial customers that are able to use fuel oil as an alternative to natural gas 
when oil prices decline  these interruptible customers may convert to oil to satisfy their fuel requirements  and our interruptible sales volumes may decline 
oil prices  as well as the prices of other fuels  fluctuate for a variety of reasons  therefore  future competitive conditions are not predictable 
to address this uncertainty  we use flexible pricing arrangements on both the supply and sales sides of this business to compete with alternative fuel price fluctuations 
as a result of the transmission operation s conversion to open access and chesapeake s florida natural gas distribution division s restructuring of its services  these businesses have shifted from providing bundled transportation and sales service to providing only transmission and contract storage services 
our electric distribution operation currently does not face substantial competition as the electric utility industry in florida has not been deregulated 
in addition  natural gas is the only viable alternative fuel to electricity in our electric service territories and is available only in a small area 
our natural gas distribution operations in delaware  maryland and florida offer unbundled transportation services to certain commercial and industrial customers 
in  chesapeake s florida natural gas distribution division  central florida gas  extended such service to residential customers 
with such transportation service available on our distribution systems  we are competing with third party suppliers to sell gas to industrial customers 
with respect to unbundled transportation services  our competitors include interstate transmission companies  if the distribution customers are located close enough to a transmission company s pipeline to make connections economically feasible 
the customers at risk are usually large volume commercial and industrial customers with the financial resources and capability to bypass our existing distribution operations in this manner 
in certain situations  our distribution operations may adjust services and rates for these customers to retain their business 
we expect to continue to expand the availability of unbundled transportation service to additional classes of distribution customers in the future 
we have also established a natural gas marketing operation in florida  delaware and maryland to provide such service to customers eligible for unbundled transportation services 
our propane distribution operations compete with several other propane distributors in their respective geographic markets  primarily on the basis of service and price  emphasizing responsive and reliable service 
our competitors generally include local outlets of national distributors and local independent distributors  whose proximity to customers entails lower costs to provide service 
propane competes with electricity as an energy source  because it is typically less expensive than electricity  based on equivalent btu value 
propane also competes with home heating oil as an energy source 
since natural gas has historically been less expensive than propane  propane is generally not distributed in geographic areas served by natural gas pipeline or distribution systems 
the propane wholesale marketing operation competes against various regional and national marketers  many of which have significantly greater resources and are able to obtain price or volumetric advantages 
our advanced information services subsidiary faces significant competition from a number of larger competitors having substantially greater resources available to them than does our subsidiary 
in addition  changes in the advanced information services business are occurring rapidly  and could adversely affect the markets for the products and services offered by these businesses 
this segment competes on the basis of technological expertise  reputation and price

table of contents management s discussion and analysis j inflation inflation affects the cost of supply  labor  products and services required for operations  maintenance and capital improvements 
while the impact of inflation has remained low in recent years  natural gas and propane prices are subject to rapid fluctuations 
in the regulated natural gas and electric distribution operations  fluctuations in natural gas and electricity prices are passed on to customers through the fuel cost recovery mechanism in our tariffs 
to help cope with the effects of inflation on our capital investments and returns  we seek rate increases from regulatory commissions for our regulated operations and closely monitor the returns of our unregulated business operations 
to compensate for fluctuations in propane gas prices  we adjust propane selling prices to the extent allowed by the market 
k marianna franchise on march   the city of marianna  florida filed a declaratory action against fpu in the circuit court of the fourteenth judicial circuit in and for jackson county  florida  alleging that fpu breached its obligations under its franchise with the city to provide electric service to customers within and without the city by failing i to develop and implement tou and interruptible rates that were mutually agreed to by the city and fpu  ii to have such mutually agreed upon rates in effect by february   and iii to have such rates available to all of fpu s customers located within and without the corporate limits of the city 
the city is seeking a declaratory judgment to exercise its option under the franchise agreement to purchase fpu s property consisting of the electric distribution assets within the city of marianna 
any such purchase would be subject to approval by the commission which would also need to approve the presentation of a referendum to voters in the city of marianna for approval of the purchase and the operation by the city of an electric distribution facility 
if the purchase is approved by the commission and the voters in the city of marianna  the closing of the purchase must occur within months after the referendum is approved 
if the purchase occurs  fpu would have a gain in the year of the disposition 
additionally  future financial results would be negatively impacted from the loss in earnings generated by fpu under the franchise agreement  however such impact is anticipated to be immaterial 
fpu intends to file a response to the city s complaint and vigorously contest this litigation and intends to oppose the passage of any proposed referendum that is presented to voters to approve the purchase of the fpu property in the city of marianna
