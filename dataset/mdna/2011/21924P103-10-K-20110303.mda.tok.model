in addition to historical information  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by the forward looking statements due to important factors including  but not limited to  those set forth in the risk factors section of this annual report on form k 
executive overview strategy we are a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on acquiring  developing and commercializing products for the respiratory and related markets 
our strategy is to leverage commercial capabilities by promoting respiratory and related products to high prescribing physicians through our respiratory sales force and to hospital based healthcare professionals through our hospital sales force  acquire rights to existing patent or trade secret protected  branded products  which can be promoted through the same channels to generate on going high value earnings streams  advance our development projects and further build a robust pipeline  and generate revenues by marketing approved generic products through our wholly owned subsidiary  aristos 
we believe that if we implement this strategy successfully  we can deliver consistent long term earnings growth 
highlights our performance for the year ended december  reflects the continued execution of our strategy 
the proportion of our sales generated by strategic products increased over the prior year 
also  we focused our business development efforts on identifying products and companies that meet our strategic acquisition criteria 
finally  we advanced our development pipeline candidates crtx  crtx  and crtx and commenced preliminary development on crtx as we committed  we also ceased manufacturing and distribution of our marketed unapproved products from which we had historically derived a significant part of our revenues 
the following summarizes certain key financial results for the year ended december  overall  cash and cash equivalents increased million or to million as of december  compared to million as of december   net revenues increased million  or  from million in to million in  the percentage of net revenues generated from strategic products increased from in to in income from operations decreased million  or  from million in to million in on a gaap basis  and decreased million  or  from million in to million in on a non gaap basis  and net income decreased million  or  from million in to million in on a gaap basis  and increased million  or  to million on a non gaap basis 

table of contents opportunities and trends we generate revenue by promoting our products to targeted physicians whose practices focus on the treatment of respiratory disorders 
primarily  these physicians are specialists 
however  we continually identify and target high decile primary care physicians who are treating patients with respiratory ailments 
we will continue to direct our marketing efforts on targeted physicians in order to understand unmet patient needs in the respiratory area 
by understanding these needs  we believe that we can systematically focus our efforts on acquiring or developing products that meet these needs 
also  we believe there are opportunities to acquire companies whose products or other assets may enhance our growth opportunities 
as of december   our working capital was million  which represents a million increase over our december  working capital of million 
the primary driver of the increase was a million increase in available cash to million as of december  also  our relationship with chiesi as a commercial partner continues to strengthen 
in what we view as a challenging economic environment  we believe these two attributes  available cash and the chiesi relationship  uniquely position us among our peers to capitalize on potential growth opportunities 
in summary  during  we plan to continue to implement our strategy of combining organic growth  strategic acquisitions and product development 
we plan to evaluate our performance with particular reference to the following fiscal and management measures  which we believe will be drivers of our success sales growth of our strategic products through our respiratory and hospital sales forces  acquisition of rights to proprietary respiratory or hospital products that align with our strategy and that offer potential for sustainable growth  and progress in the development of our product candidates  including receiving marketing approval by the fda for crtx in meanwhile  our recent results reflect our diminished reliance on marketed unapproved products to generate revenues  and this trend will continue 
in december  we sold our remaining inventory of these products  which included allerx dose pack products and the hyomax product family 
revenue related to these sales was deferred due to our inability to reasonably estimate returns as a result of large channel inventory levels and extended payment terms given related to certain sales 
as a result  revenue from the sales of these products will be recorded at the later of when cash payment is received or the risk of product returns has been substantially eliminated  which we expect will be when the product is sold to the end user based upon prescriptions filled 
for this reason  net product sales for these products will continue to be recognized after even though we are no longer manufacturing and distributing these products 
our net sales of allerx dose pack products and the hyomax family of products were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
on november   the company announced that it was complying with a request from the fda that the industry voluntarily remove all products containing propoxyphene from the us market 
net product sales from the company s three propoxyphene products were million  million and million in   and  respectively 
during  we continued our intentional  strategic shift away from marketed unapproved products in order to focus on the branded approved products and  as of december   we are no longer manufacturing or distributing any marketed unapproved products 
because we have historically derived significant revenues from sales of marketed unapproved products  we expect that our net product sales will begin to decline once all of our deferred revenue related to recent sales of these products has been recognized 
we plan to replace these revenues  as well as revenues from other products we withdrew from the market in  with increased revenues from our branded approved products  particularly curosurf and zyflo cr  and with revenues from our cough cold product candidate  crtx  for which we are targeting fda approval during  and from any other approved products which we can acquire and commercialize

as a result of changes in market dynamics  large amounts of channel inventory and extended payment terms offered on certain sales  we are unable to estimate returns due to uncertainty regarding consumer demand and the level of competition 
deferred revenue related to these sales will be recognized as revenue when prescriptions are filled 
hyomax net product sales decreased million  or  during compared to this decrease was primarily due to lower net prices and lower volume as a result of increased competition from other manufacturers as well as deferral of revenue from sales made during december at december   approximately million of revenue from sales of hyomax products was deferred due to the inability to estimate returns

we added curosurf and factive to our product portfolio during the third quarter of provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes was million during  compared to million in our effective tax rates for and were and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate was due to the impact of the release of valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets during as well as changes in the estimated income tax provision related to the year ended december  the majority of the impact from changes in the estimated income tax provision related to a change in estimate regarding utilization of net operating losses resulting from additional analysis that we performed related to the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that can be used under the rules governing ownership changes in section of the internal revenue code 
we performed an in depth analysis during the year that resulted in a larger amount of net operating loss carryforward to be available to offset taxable income for the tax year 
upon release of the valuation allowances  we fully utilized our net operating loss carryforwards that were not subject to limitations  thereby reducing total income tax expense in and significantly lowering our effective tax rate

reconciliation of non gaap financial measures to supplement the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with gaap  we use non gaap measures of certain components of financial performance 
these non gaap measures include non gaap operating income  non gaap net income and non gaap net income per diluted share 
our management regularly uses supplemental non gaap financial measures to understand  manage and evaluate our business and make operating decisions 
these non gaap measures are among the primary factors management uses in planning for and forecasting future periods 
these non gaap measures are not in accordance with  or an alternative to  measures prepared in accordance with gaap and may be different from similarly titled non gaap measures used by other companies 
in addition  these non gaap measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles 
the additional non gaap financial information presented herein should be considered in conjunction with  and not as a substitute for  or superior to  the financial information presented in accordance with gaap such as operating income  net income and earnings per share and should not be considered measures of our liquidity 
these non gaap measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding gaap measures 
the non gaap financial measures reflect adjustments for stock based compensation expense  amortization of product rights and acquisition related expenses 
acquisition related expenses consist of certain expenses that were incurred in connection with the transaction with chiesi  including additional stock based compensation due to the accelerated vesting of certain stock options and shares of restricted stock resulting from the closing of that transaction 
we exclude these expenses from our non gaap measures because we believe that their exclusion provides an additional means to assess the extent to which our efforts and execution of our strategy are reflected in our operating results 
in particular  stock based compensation expense is excluded primarily because it is a non cash expense that is determined based on subjective assumptions  product rights amortization is excluded because it is not reflective of the cash settled expenses incurred related to product sales  and acquisition related expenses are excluded because they arise from prior acquisitions and management believes they have no direct correlation to current operating results 
our management believes that these non gaap measures  when shown in conjunction with the corresponding gaap measures  enhance investors and management s overall understanding of our current financial performance and our prospects for the future 
the non gaap measures are subject to inherent limitations because they do not reflect all of the expenses associated with the results of operations as determined in accordance with gaap and the exclusion of these expenses involved the exercise of judgment by management 
even though we have excluded stock based compensation expense  amortization of product rights and acquisition related expenses from the non gaap financial measures  stock based compensation is an integral part of our compensation structure  the acquisition of product rights is an important part of our business strategy and the transaction with chiesi resulted in significant cash expenses

off balance sheet arrangements since inception  we have not engaged in any off balance sheet arrangements  including structured finance  special purpose entities or variable interest entities 
effects of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on our revenues or results of operations since inception 
we expect our cost of product sales and other operating expenses will change in the future in line with periodic inflationary changes in price levels 
because we intend to retain and continue to use our property and equipment  we believe that the incremental inflation related to the replacement costs of such items will not materially affect our operations 
however  the rate of inflation affects our expenses  such as those for employee compensation and contract services  which could increase our level of expenses and the rate at which we use our resources 
while our management generally believes that we will be able to offset the effect of price level changes by adjusting our product prices and implementing operating efficiencies  any material unfavorable changes in price levels could have a material adverse affect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and other financial information 
we base these estimates on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  and these estimates form the basis for our judgments concerning the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we periodically evaluate our estimates and judgments based on available information and experience 
actual results could differ from our estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
if actual results significantly differ from our estimates  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially impacted 
we believe that the accounting policies described below are critical to understanding our business  results of operations and financial condition because they involve more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form k for a description of our significant accounting policies and method used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we record revenue from product sales  license agreements and royalty agreements when realized or realizable and earned 
revenue is realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
net product sales product sales 
we recognize revenue from our product sales upon transfer of title  which occurs when product is received by our customers 
we sell our products primarily to large national wholesalers  which have the right to return the products they purchase 
we estimate the amount of future returns at the time of revenue recognition 
we recognize product sales net of estimated allowances for product returns  rebates  price adjustments  chargebacks  and prompt payment and other discounts 
when we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of future product returns  we record revenues when the risk of product return has been substantially eliminated 
as of december   the company had million of deferred revenue related to sales for which future returns could not be reasonably estimated at the time of sale 
deferred revenue is recorded net of estimated allowances for rebates  price adjustments  chargebacks  and prompt payment and other discounts 
estimated allowances are recorded and classified as accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december  the deferred revenue is recognized when the product is sold through to the end user based upon prescriptions filled 
to estimate product sold through to end users  we rely on third party information  including prescription data and information obtained from significant distributors with respect to their inventory levels and sell through to customers 
when we implement a price increase  we generally offer our existing customers an opportunity to purchase a limited quantity of product at the previous list price 
shipments resulting from these programs generally are not materially in excess of ordinary levels  therefore  we recognize the related revenue when the product is received by the customers and include the shipments in estimating our various product related allowances 
in the event we determine that these shipments represent purchases of inventory in excess of ordinary levels for a given wholesaler  the potential impact on product returns exposure would be specifically evaluated and reflected as a reduction in revenue at the time of such shipments 
product returns 
consistent with industry practice  we offer contractual return rights that allow our customers to return the majority of our products within an month period that begins six months prior to and ends up to twelve months subsequent to expiration of the products 
our products have an to month 
table of contents expiration period from the date of manufacture 
in determining our return allowance  we consider various relevant factors  including actual and historical return rates for expired lots 
our historical return rates for expired lots vary by product and approximate  on a product by product basis  our current return rates 
historical and forecasted product sales and consumer consumption data reported by external information management companies 
management reviews sales forecasts and consumption data on a product by product basis to assist it in estimating whether product is expected to become short dated and thus subject to return 
estimated expiration dates or remaining shelf life of inventory in the distribution channel 
our products generally have remaining shelf lives of between to months at time of shipment 
levels of inventory in the distribution channel and any significant changes to these levels 
levels of inventory in the distribution channel typically range from six to eight weeks of product demand 
competitive issues such as new product entrants and other known changes in sales trends 
based on the above factors  management determines an estimated return rate for each product and applies that rate to the quantity of units sold that is subject to future return 
as of december   our estimated return rates for products currently subject to return ranged from to depending on the product 
we routinely assess our experience with product returns and adjust our reserves accordingly 
the amount of actual product returns could be either higher or lower than the amounts we have accrued 
changes in our returns estimates are charged to income in the period in which the information that gives rise to the change becomes known 
if our estimates of returns differ from our actual results  there could be a material impact on our financial statements 
based on historical experience  our average actual return rates vary based on our product mix 
we consider a one percentage point variation to be a reasonably possible change in the percentage of our product returns to related gross sales on a product by product basis 
a one percentage point increase or decrease in each of the individual product s estimated product returns rate would have had an approximate million  or  effect on our net revenues recognized in expense recognized for product returns was million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing  and of gross product sales in  and  respectively 
expense recognized during for product returns related to current year sales was million  or of gross product sales 
expense recognized during for product returns related to sales made in prior years was million  or of gross product sales 
the additional expense of million consisted of million  million  million and million related to allerx dose pack products  spectracef  zyflo family of products and factive  respectively  partially offset by a million reduction to our estimate of product returns upon the withdrawal of our propoxyphene acetaminophen products 
the majority of additional expense recorded in for allerx related to an increase in actual returns of allerx pe and allerx df products due to significant changes in market dynamics during early all sales of allerx pe and allerx df made in were deferred due to our inability to estimate returns 
during  demand for certain of our spectracef products declined due to increased competition in the antibiotic market and dilution of our sales promotion efforts as a result of the introduction of factive into our product portfolio 
as a result  we increased our estimated rates for product returns for these various spectracef products by a range of two to eight percentage points of gross product sales  depending on the specific spectracef product 
additional expense of million related to zyflo cr and zyflo was recorded to account for an increase in actual returns compared to management s initial estimate at the time of the merger 
the product 
table of contents returns relate to product sold by critical therapeutics  inc prior to the merger 
these returns have not affected our estimated rate of returns on sales made subsequent to the merger 
during  we increased our estimated rate of return for factive by eight percentage points 
this increase is due to a change in our initial estimate of product returns related to sales made by oscient prior to our acquisition of factive product rights 
in addition  we believe these product return rates will remain at the higher levels due to lower than expected sales volume 
rebates 
the liability for government program rebates is calculated based on historical and current rebate redemption and utilization rates contractually submitted by each program s administrator 
expense recognized for rebates was million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing approximately  and of gross product sales in  and  respectively 
the increase in rebates as a percentage of gross product sales is primarily due to new legislation  specifically health care reform 
price adjustments and chargebacks 
our estimates of price adjustments and chargebacks are based on our estimated mix of sales to various third party payors  which are entitled either contractually or statutorily to discounts from the listed prices of our products 
these estimates are also based on the contract fees we pay to certain group purchasing organizations  or gpos  in connection with our sales of curosurf 
we make these estimates based on the facts and circumstances known to us in accordance with gaap 
in the event that the sales mix to third party payors or the contract fees paid to gpos are different from our estimates  we may be required to pay higher or lower total price adjustments and or chargebacks than we have estimated 
from time to time  we offer certain promotional incentives to our customers for our products  and we expect that we will continue this practice in the future 
these programs include sample cards to retail consumers  certain product incentives to pharmacy customers and other sales stocking allowances 
we estimate our liability for each promotional program and record the liabilities as price adjustments 
we estimate our liability for these voucher programs based on the historical redemption rates for similar completed programs used by other pharmaceutical companies as reported to us by a third party claims processing organization and actual redemption rates for our completed programs 
expense recognized for price adjustments and chargebacks was million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing approximately  and of gross product sales in  and  respectively 
the increase in the expense as a percentage of gross product sales during was primarily due to increased competition for hyomax  increase in the number of voucher programs offered  and the addition of curosurf to our product portfolio  which caused higher levels of price adjustments and chargebacks 
there were no current period adjustments during related to prior period provisions for price adjustments and chargebacks 
we do not expect future changes in our estimates for price adjustments and chargebacks to be material 
prompt payment discounts 
we typically require our customers to remit payments within the first or days  depending on the customer and the products purchased 
in addition  we offer wholesale distributors a prompt payment discount if they make payments within these deadlines 
this discount is generally  but may be higher in some instances due to product launches or customer and or industry expectations 
because our wholesale distributors typically take the prompt payment discount  we accrue of the prompt payment discounts  based on the gross amount of each invoice  at the time of our original sale to them  and we apply earned discounts at the time of payment 
we adjust the accrual periodically to reflect actual experience 
historically  these adjustments have not been material 
we do not anticipate that future changes to our estimates of prompt payment discounts will have a material impact on our net revenue 
expense recognized for prompt payment discounts was million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing approximately of gross product sales in each year
