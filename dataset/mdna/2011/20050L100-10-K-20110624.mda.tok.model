critical accounting policies and estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
principles of consolidation the accompanying consolidated financial statements include our accounts and accounts of our wholly owned domestic subsidiaries 
as of december   strategic security services  inc  rodgers police patrol  inc and command security services  inc  the company s three wholly owned subsidiaries  were merged with and into command security corporation 
all significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in our consolidated financial statements 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the estimates that we make include allowances for doubtful accounts  depreciation and amortization  income tax assets and insurance reserves 
estimates are based on historical experience  where applicable or other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances 
due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates  actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition we record revenues as services are provided to our customers 
revenues consist primarily of aviation and security services  which are typically billed at hourly rates 
these rates may vary depending on base  overtime and holiday time worked 
revenue for administrative services provided to other security companies are calculated as a percentage of the administrative service customer revenue and are recognized when billings for the related security services are generated 
revenue is reported net of applicable taxes 
trade receivables we periodically evaluate the requirement for providing for billing adjustments and or credit losses on our accounts receivable 
we provide for billing adjustments where management determines that there is a likelihood of a significant adjustment for disputed billings 
criteria used by management to evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts include  among others  the creditworthiness of the customer  current trends  prior payment performance  the age of the receivables and our overall historical loss experience 
individual accounts are charged off against the allowance as management deems them as uncollectible 
intangible assets intangible assets are stated at cost and consist primarily of customer lists and borrowing costs that are being amortized on a straight line basis over three to ten years and goodwill which is reviewed annually for impairment 
the life assigned to customer lists acquired is based on management s estimate of the attrition rate 
the attrition rate is estimated based on historical contract longevity and management s operating experience 
we test for impairment annually or when events and circumstances warrant such a review  if sooner 
any potential impairment is evaluated based on anticipated undiscounted future cash flows and actual customer attrition in accordance with fasb asc  property  plant  and equipment 
insurance reserves general liability estimated accrued liabilities are calculated on an undiscounted basis based on actual claim data and estimates of incurred but not reported claims developed utilizing historical claim trends 
projected settlements and incurred but not reported claims are estimated based on pending claims  historical trends and data 
workers compensation annual premiums are based on the incurred losses as determined at the end of the coverage period  subject to minimum and maximum premium 
estimated accrued liabilities are based on our historical loss experience and the ratio of claims paid to our historical payout profiles 
income taxes income taxes are based on income loss for financial reporting purposes and reflect a current tax liability asset for the estimated taxes payable recoverable in the current year tax return and changes in deferred taxes 
deferred tax assets or liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax laws and rates 
a valuation allowance is provided on deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized 
the company determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities before any part of the benefit can be recorded in the financial statements 
in the event that interest and or penalties are assessed in connection with our tax filings  interest will be recorded as interest expense and penalties as selling  general and administrative expense 
stock based compensation fasb asc  stock compensation  requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values at grant date and the recognition of the related expense over the period in which the share based compensation vests 
we use the modified prospective transition method 
under the modified prospective transition method  we recognize compensation expense in our financial statements for all share based payments granted  modified or settled 
non cash charges of  and  for stock based compensation have been recorded for the years ended march  and  respectively 
overview we principally provide uniformed security officers and aviation services to commercial  residential  financial  industrial  aviation and governmental customers through more than company offices in over states throughout the united states 
in conjunction with providing these services  we assume responsibility for a variety of functions  including recruiting  hiring  training and supervising all operating personnel as well as paying such personnel and providing them with uniforms  fringe benefits and workers compensation insurance 
our customer focused mission is to provide the best personalized supervision and management attention necessary to deliver timely and efficient security solutions so that our customers can operate in safe environments without disruption or loss 
technology underpins our efficiency  accuracy and dependability 
we use a sophisticated software system that integrates scheduling  payroll and billing functions  giving customers the benefit of customized programs using the personnel best suited to the job 
renewing and extending existing contracts and obtaining new contracts are crucial to our ability to generate revenues  earnings and cash flow 
in addition  our growth strategy involves the acquisition and integration of complementary businesses in order to increase our scale within certain geographical areas  capture market share in the markets in which we operate and improve our profitability 
we intend to pursue acquisition opportunities for contract security officer businesses 
we frequently evaluate acquisition opportunities and  at any given time  may be in various stages of due diligence or preliminary discussions with respect to a number of potential acquisitions 
from time to time  we may enter into non binding letters of intent  but we are currently not subject to any definitive agreement with respect to any acquisition material to our operations or otherwise so far advanced in any discussions as to make an acquisition material to our operations reasonable certain 
however  we cannot assure you that we will identify any suitable acquisition candidates or  if identified  that we will be able to complete the acquisition of such candidates on favorable terms or at all 
the global security industry has grown largely due to an increasing fear of crime and terrorism 
in the united states  the demand for security related products and central station monitoring services also has grown steadily 
we believe that there is continued heightened attention to and demand for security due to worldwide events  and the ensuing threat  or perceived threat  of criminal and terrorist activities 
for these reasons  we expect that security will continue to be a key area of focus both domestically in the united states and internationally 
demand for security officer services is dependent upon a number of factors  including demographic trends  general economic variables such as growth in the gross domestic product  unemployment rates  consumer spending levels  perceived and actual crime rates  government legislation  terrorism sensitivity  war external conflicts and technology 
results of operations earnings our net income for the fiscal years ended march  and was  and  respectively 
our net income was impacted primarily by i a full twelve months of security services related to a contract that commenced at various dates during the prior year period to provide security services to a major transportation company  and ii expansion of services provided to new and existing security customers and several airlines 
net income decreased in the current year period as compared with the same period last year primarily due to i the loss of skycap  wheelchair  cargo  security and baggage handling services previously provided to delta air lines delta at john f 
kennedy international airport jfk  ii the loss of a contract to provide services to a major domestic airline carrier at oakland international airport oak  iii higher wage and related benefit rates at los angeles international airport lax resulting from local living wage ordinances and a collective bargaining agreement which we were not able to fully recover through increases to our customer billing rates during the current year and iv reductions in service hours and rates of certain security services customers 
revenues our revenues for the fiscal year ended march  were essentially the same as our revenues for the fiscal year ended march  revenues in fiscal increased  or to  from  in fiscal our revenues were impacted primarily by i a full twelve months of revenues in the current year period related to a contract that commenced at various dates during the prior year period to provide security services to a major transportation company that generated additional aggregate revenues in the fiscal year ended march  of approximately  ii expansion of services provided to new and existing security customers and several airlines that resulted in additional aggregate revenues of approximately  and iii rate increases at lax in connection with higher wage and related benefit rates resulting from local living wage ordinances and a collective bargaining agreement 
the increase in our revenues was partially offset by i the loss of revenues of approximately  associated with skycap  wheelchair  cargo  security and baggage handling services previously provided to delta at jfk  ii the loss of a contract to provide services to a major domestic airline carrier at oak of approximately  and iii reductions in service hours and rates of certain security and aviation services customers 
gross profit our gross profit for the fiscal year ended march  decreased  or to  of revenues from  of revenues for fiscal our gross profit was impacted primarily by i the loss of delta skycap  wheelchair  cargo  security and baggage handling services at jfk as noted above  ii the loss of an aviation services contract at oak as noted above  iii higher wage and related benefit rates at lax resulting from local living wage ordinances and a collective bargaining agreement which we were not able to fully recover through increases to our customer billing rates during the current year period and iv reductions in service hours and rates of certain security services customers 
the decrease in gross profit was partially offset by i expansion of security services to a major transportation company as noted above and ii expansion of services provided to new and existing security customers and several airlines as discussed above 
we have an insurance policy covering workers compensation claims in states in which we perform services 
estimated accrued liabilities are based on our historical loss experience and the ratio of claims paid to our historical payout profiles 
charges for estimated workers compensation related losses incurred and included in cost of sales were  and  for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
the nature of our business also subjects us to claims or litigation alleging that we are liable for damages as a result of the conduct of our employees or others 
we insure against such claims and suits through general liability policies with third party insurance companies 
our insurance coverage limits are currently  per occurrence for non aviation related business with an additional excess umbrella policy of  and  per occurrence for aviation related business 
we retain the risk for the first  per occurrence on the non aviation related policy which includes airport wheelchair and electric cart operations  and  on the aviation related policy except for  for damage to aircraft and  for skycap operations 
estimated accrued liabilities are based on specific reserves in connection with existing claims as determined by third party risk management consultants and actuarial factors and the timing of reported claims 
these are all factored into estimated losses incurred but not yet reported to us 
general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended march  increased by  to  of revenues from  of revenues in fiscal the increase in general and administrative expenses resulted primarily from i executive salaries resulting mainly from additional costs associated with reorganizing and closing one regional cost center and increased charges for vacation time  ii facility costs and iii professional fees 
partially offsetting the increase in general and administrative expenses are lower administrative salaries 
provision for doubtful accounts the provision for doubtful accounts for the fiscal year ended march  decreased by  to  from  in fiscal the decrease is due mainly to the absence in fiscal of an additional bad debt charge of  recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal in connection with a large medical center customer located in the new york metropolitan area that filed for protection under chapter of the bankruptcy code in april we periodically evaluate the requirement for providing for billing adjustments and or credit losses on our accounts receivable 
we provide for billing adjustments where our management determines that there is a likelihood of a significant adjustment for disputed billings 
criteria used by management to evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts include  among others  the creditworthiness of the customer  current trends  prior payment performance  the age of the receivables and our overall historical loss experience 
individual accounts are charged off against the allowance as management deems them as uncollectible 
we do not know if bad debts will increase in future periods nor does our management believe that the decrease during the fiscal year ended march  compared with the same period of the prior year is necessarily indicative of a trend 
bad debt recoveries bad debt recoveries for the fiscal year ended march  increased by  to  from  in fiscal due mainly to stock that we received under our claim related to the bankruptcy filing of a security services customer  which was valued at approximately  interest income interest income was comparable for the fiscal years ended march  and  and principally represents interest earned on cash balances 
interest expense interest expense for the fiscal year ended march  decreased by  to  from  in fiscal the decrease is due mainly to lower average outstanding borrowings and weighted average interest rates under our commercial revolving loan agreement 
the decrease was partially offset by increased interest expense associated with our short term insurance financing 
equipment dispositions equipment dispositions are a result of the sale of vehicles  office equipment and security equipment at prices above or below book value 
the  and  gain on equipment dispositions for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively  were primarily due to the disposition of company vehicles at amounts in excess of their respective book values 
gain on sale of investments the  gain on sale of investments for the fiscal year ended march  represents proceeds in excess of carrying amount for the sale of stock received under our claim related to the bankruptcy filing of spansion inc provision for income taxes provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended march  decreased  compared with fiscal due mainly to a decrease in our pre tax earnings and effective tax rate 
we have determined based on our expectations for the future that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be sufficient to utilize fully the net deferred tax assets at march  and liquidity and capital resources we pay employees and administrative service customers on a weekly basis  while customers pay for services generally within days after billing by us 
in order to fund our payroll and operations  we maintain a commercial revolving loan arrangement  currently with wells fargo  to fund our payroll and operations 
our principal use of short term borrowings is for carrying accounts receivable 
our short term borrowings have supported the accounts receivable associated with our ongoing expansion and organic growth 
we intend to continue to use our short term borrowings to support our working capital requirements 
we believe that our existing funds  cash generated from operations  and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our working capital  capital expenditure and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future 
however  we cannot assure you that this will be the case  and we may be required to obtain alternative or additional financing to maintain and expand our existing operations through the sale of our securities  an increase in our credit facilities or otherwise 
we are currently evaluating preliminary terms and conditions as relates to an extension of our existing credit agreement 
the failure by us to obtain such financing  if needed  would have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition and results of operations 
wells fargo revolving loan on february   we entered into a new  credit facility with wells fargo the credit agreement 
this new credit facility  which matures in february contains customary affirmative and negative covenants  including  among other things  covenants requiring us to maintain certain financial ratios 
this new facility replaced our previous  revolving credit facility with cit group business credit  inc  and was used to refinance outstanding indebtedness under that facility  to pay fees and expenses in connection therewith and  thereafter  for working capital including acquisitions  letters of credit and other general corporate purposes 
the credit agreement provides for a letter of credit sub line in an aggregate amount of up to  the credit agreement also provides for interest to be calculated on the outstanding principal balance of the revolving loans at the prime rate as defined in the credit agreement plus 
for libor loans  interest will be calculated on the outstanding principal balance of the libor loans at the libor rate as defined in the credit agreement plus 
as of march   the interest rates were and for revolving and libor loans under the credit agreement  respectively 
as of march   the interest rates were and for revolving and libor loans under the credit agreement  respectively 
closing costs for the credit agreement totaled  and are being amortized over the three year life of the credit agreement 
as of march  and  we had borrowed  and  in libor loans and had approximately  and  letters of credit outstanding under the credit agreement representing approximately and of the maximum borrowing capacity under the credit agreement based on our eligible accounts receivable as defined under the credit agreement as of such dates  respectively 
we rely on our revolving loan from wells fargo which contains a fixed charge covenant and various other financial and non financial covenants 
if we breach a covenant  wells fargo has the right to immediately request the repayment in full of all borrowings under the credit agreement  unless wells fargo waives the breach 
for the fiscal year ended march   we were in compliance with all covenants under the credit agreement 
other borrowings we may obtain short term financing to meet our annual property and casualty insurance needs 
for the fiscal years ended march  and   and  respectively  was borrowed for this purpose at an annual interest rate of for each year 
at march  and  we had  and  respectively  of short term insurance borrowings outstanding 
during the fiscal year ended march   we decreased our libor borrowings by  and increased our insurance financing borrowing by  cash flows the following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the fiscal years ended march  and net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities investing we have no material commitments for capital expenditures at this time 
financing the company may obtain short term financing to meet its insurance needs 
for the fiscal years ended march  and   and  respectively  was borrowed for this purpose as described under other borrowings above 
working capital working capital increased by  or  to  as of march   from  as of march  we experienced checks issued in advance of deposits defined as checks drawn in advance of future deposits of  as of march   compared with  at march  cash balances and book overdrafts can fluctuate materially from day to day depending on such factors as collections  timing of billing and payroll dates  and are covered via advances from the revolving loan as checks are presented for payment 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are currently material or reasonably likely to be material to our financial position or results of operations 
outlook financial results our future revenues will largely depend on our ability to gain additional business from new and existing customers in our security and aviation services divisions at acceptable margins while minimizing terminations of contracts with existing customers 
in addition  our growth strategy involves the acquisition and integration of complementary businesses in order to increase our scale within certain geographical areas  capture market share in the markets in which we operate and improve our profitability 
we intend to pursue acquisition opportunities for contract security officer businesses 
our ability to complete future acquisitions will depend on our ability to identify suitable acquisitions candidates  negotiate acceptable terms for their acquisition and  if necessary  finance those acquisitions 
our security services division continues to experience organic growth over the past few years as demand for security services has increased steadily 
our current focus is on increasing revenue while our sales and marketing team and branch managers work to develop new business and retain profitable contracts 
however  several of our airline customers have continued to reduce capacity within their system which results in reductions of service hours provided by us to such carriers 
also  competitive pressures impact our ability to gain or maintain sales  gross margins and or employees 
since september   the department of homeland security and the transportation security administration have implemented numerous security measures that affect airline operations  including expanded cargo and baggage screening  and are likely to implement additional measures in the future 
additional measures taken to enhance either passenger or cargo security procedures in the future may increase the airline industry s demand for third party services provided by us 
additionally  our aviation services division is continually subject to such government regulation  which has adversely affected us in the past with the federalization of the pre board screening services and the document verification process at several of our domestic airport locations 
our gross profit margin decreased during the fiscal year ended march  to of revenues  compared with for the corresponding period of the previous year 
we expect our gross profit margins to average between and of revenue for fiscal year based on current business conditions 
we expect gross profit to remain under pressure due primarily to continued price competition 
however  we expect these effects to be moderated by continued operational efficiencies resulting from better management and leveraging of our cost structures  improved workers compensation experience ratings  workflow process efficiencies associated with our integrated financial software system and higher contributions from our continuing new business development 
our cost reduction program is expected to reduce certain of our operating and general and administrative expenses in future periods 
additional cost reduction opportunities are being identified and will be pursued as they are determined 
our security services division generated approximately million  or of our revenues for the fiscal year ended march  one security services customer accounted for approximately million or of our total revenues for the fiscal year ended march  the loss of this customer or any material reduction in business from this customer would materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our aviation services division generated approximately million or of our revenues for the fiscal year ended march  during the second half of fiscal  we participated in a competitive bidding process for a major domestic carrier s aviation services business at both existing and potentially new domestic airport locations 
during the fiscal year ended march   we were advised that we were not the successful bidder to either retain our existing business or be awarded additional new business with such airline carrier 
annual revenues with such airline aggregated approximately million among several of our existing domestic airport locations 
the aviation industry continues to face various financial and other challenges  including the cost of security and higher fuel prices 
additional bankruptcy filings by aviation and non aviation customers could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity  results of operations and financial condition 
as described above on february   we entered into a new  credit facility the credit agreement with wells fargo 
as of the close of business on june   our cash availability was approximately  which we believe is sufficient to meet our needs for the foreseeable future barring any increase in reserves imposed by wells fargo 
we believe that existing funds  cash generated from operations  and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our working capital  capital expenditure and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future  barring any increase in reserves imposed by wells fargo 
however  we cannot assure you that this will be the case  and we may be required to obtain alternative or additional financing to maintain and expand our existing operations through the sale of our securities  an increase in credit facilities or otherwise 
the financial markets generally  and the credit markets in particular  are and have been experiencing substantial turbulence and turmoil  and extreme volatility  both in the united states and  increasingly  in other markets worldwide 
the current market situation has resulted generally in substantial reductions in available loans to a broad spectrum of businesses  increased scrutiny by lenders of the credit worthiness of borrowers  more restrictive covenants imposed by lenders upon borrowers under credit and similar agreements and  in some cases  increased interest rates under commercial and other loans 
if we require alternative or additional financing at this or any other time  we cannot assure you that such financing will be available upon commercially acceptable terms or at all 
if we fail to obtain additional financing when and if required by us  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected
