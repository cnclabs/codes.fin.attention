item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to those financial statements  included elsewhere in this filing 
except where otherwise indicated or where the context is clear  the portfolio statistics in item of this form k represent or are calculated from our carry value for financial reporting purposes before depreciation and amortization 
with respect to our loan portfolio  we have adjusted our carry value to exclude a million general loss reserve 
overview we are a reit that invests primarily in single tenant commercial real estate assets subject to long term leases to high credit quality tenants 
we focus on properties that are subject to a net lease  or a lease that requires the tenant to pay all or substantially all property operating expenses  such as utilities  real estate taxes  insurance and routine maintenance 
we also continue to be opportunistic and have made and expect to continue to make investments in single tenant properties where the owner has exposure to property operating expenses when we determine we can sufficiently underwrite that exposure and isolate a predictable cash flow 
our primary business line is and we expect will continue to be the ownership of single tenant properties 
we also have a portfolio of first mortgage loans and other debt investments on single tenant properties and may continue to make such debt investments from time to time on an opportunistic basis in the future 
as a result of lease non renewals or lease terminations  we have classified three properties as multi tenant properties  as each is no longer leased primarily by a single tenant 
as of december   we had an approximately billion investment portfolio  including billion of owned properties and billion of loans and other debt investments 
our primary business objective is to generate stable  long term and attractive returns based on the spread between the yields generated by our assets and the cost of financing our portfolio 
we believe that our focus on assets leased to high credit quality tenants subject to long term leases will provide us with a stable and predictable stream of cash flows that will support our business and the payment of dividends to our stockholders for the foreseeable future 
the principal sources of our revenues are rental income on our owned real properties and interest income from our debt investments loans and securities 
in order to grow our revenues  we will be primarily dependent on our ability to add new assets to our portfolio 
we are also intensely focused on growing revenues by re letting vacant space within our portfolio 
as of december   the occupancy rate in our owned property portfolio was with virtually all of the vacant space being in our office property in johnston  rhode island and our two office buildings in omaha  nebraska 
we cannot provide any assurance as to when and on what terms we will be able to re let properties that are or may become vacant in our portfolio 
the principal sources of our expenses are interest expense on our assets financed  depreciation expense on our real properties  general and administrative expenses and property expenses net of expense recoveries 
with the exception of our credit agreement with wells fargo bank  all of our debt is currently fixed rate and  therefore  the interest expense we pay is not subject to fluctuation based on changes in market interest rates 
our credit agreement with wells fargo bank is floating rate debt and  therefore  the interest expense we pay is expected to increase if interest rates  in particular the one month libor rate  increases 
the average remaining lease term on our owned properties is approximately years  although we have some leases that are scheduled to mature over the next few years 
we are subject to the risk that our tenants do not renew their leases at maturity and that we are unable to promptly re let the property  or the terms of renewal or re letting may be less favorable to us than the current lease terms  any of which could result in a reduction in our revenues and an increase in our property operating costs 
we rely on leverage to allow us to invest in a greater number of assets and enhance our asset returns 
our overall portfolio leverage  expressed as a percentage of our total debt to our total assets before depreciation and amortization on owned properties and with other minor adjustments  was approximately as of december  our leverage ratios by segment as of december  were approximately for the owned properties segment and for the debt investments segment 
see liquidity and capital resources leverage below for information about our use of leverage ratios and how we compute them 
we expect our leverage level to continue to decrease over time  as a result of one or more of the following factors scheduled principal amortization on our debt  voluntary debt reduction including potentially through selected asset sales  and lower or no leverage on new asset acquisitions 
during  the focus of our portfolio activity was on strengthening our balance sheet through debt repayment and or repurchase and on resuming portfolio growth as market conditions permitted during the second half of the year 
our portfolio financing strategy is to finance our assets with long term fixed rate debt as soon as practicable after we invest  generally on a secured  non recourse basis 
through non recourse debt  we seek to limit the overall company exposure in the event we default on the debt to the amount we have invested in the asset or assets financed 
we also had million of recourse debt obligations outstanding as of december   including million outstanding under our credit agreement with wells fargo bank which is scheduled to mature in july we will be required to repay or refinance our debt obligations at maturity  which we expect  although cannot provide any assurance  that we will be able to do 
to the extent we are unable to refinance debt obligations  we may rely on a combination of cash on hand  cash from asset sales  and cash from future debt or equity capital raises to fund the liquidity needed to repay the obligations 
our ability to refinance debt  sell assets and or raise capital on favorable terms will be highly dependent upon prevailing market conditions 
business environment the performance of our existing portfolio and our ability to add new assets will continue to be impacted by market conditions 
commercial real estate market conditions are improving  although various signs of weakness still persist 
for example  delinquency rates on commercial real estate loans remains at historic highs  which has impacted the amount and terms of credit available for new transactions 
further  overall transaction volumes remain lower and interest rates remain at historic lows  which has driven significant competition for new investment opportunities 
we cannot provide any assurance as to when and at what yields and other terms we will be able to add new assets to our portfolio 
in addition  while rents and property values have been recovering in some markets  weakness and uncertainty persists  particularly in those markets hardest hit by the recent downturn 
we have a series of leases maturing over the next several years and commercial real estate conditions in the relevant markets at lease maturity will have a significant impact on our ability to retain tenants or re let vacant properties promptly and on favorable terms as leases mature 
we also have a series of non recourse mortgages on our owned properties maturing over the next several years and lending for commercial real estate transactions  while improving  remains uneven and muted  which could impact our ability to sell properties and refinance maturing debt on favorable terms or at all 
we cannot make any assurance that capital markets will be favorable to us at any time  which could impact our ability to raise capital to support our business  including to add new assets to our portfolio and support additional investments in our existing assets 
application of critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires the use of judgments  estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following is a summary of our accounting policies that are most affected by judgments  estimates and assumptions 
the summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of our accounting policies included in note to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
impairment on owned real properties 
we are required under gaap to review our owned properties for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
the evaluation includes estimating and reviewing anticipated future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset 
if such cash flows are less than the asset s carrying value  an impairment charge is recognized to earnings to the extent by which the asset s carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value 
estimating future cash flows is highly subjective and includes an evaluation of factors such as the anticipated cash flows from the property  which may include rent from current leases in place and projected future leases  estimated capital expenditures  and an estimate of proceeds to be realized upon sale of the property 
our estimates could differ materially from actual results 
we did not record any impairment losses on our owned properties during we recorded impairment losses on our owned properties of million in including million on the write down to estimated fair value of a property in johnston  rhode island that is now vacant and million on the sale of one property during and a second property sold during  and million in impairment of loan investments 
we are required under gaap to periodically evaluate each of our loan investments for possible impairment 
in accordance with applicable accounting guidance  our impairment analysis includes both a general reserve component on performing loans and an asset specific component on loans where we have deemed it probable that we will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms 
significant judgment is required in the analysis of each component  including under the general reserve component making estimates of the likelihood of default and lease rejection given the credit characteristics of the tenant  and estimates of stressed collateral values and potential bankruptcy claim recoveries  and under the asset specific component evaluating factors such as the status of the loans ie  current or expected payment or other defaults  the credit quality of the underlying tenants  the present value of expected future cash flows on the loans  the fair market value of our collateral  and the amount and status of any senior debt 
these estimates are highly subjective and could differ materially from actual results 
as of december   we had a general loan loss reserve of million established in and an asset specific loan loss reserve related to a mezzanine loan investment of million established in 
purchase accounting for acquisition of real estate 
we allocate the purchase price of rental real estate acquired to the following based on fair values acquired tangible assets  consisting of land  building and improvements  and identified intangible assets and liabilities  consisting of above market and below market leases  in place leases and tenant relationships 
in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired  we consider information obtained about each property as a result of our due diligence activities and other market data  and utilize various valuation methods  such as estimated cash flow projections utilizing appropriate discount and capitalization rates  estimates of replacement costs  and available market information 
the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant the dark value 
above market and below market lease values for acquired properties are recorded based on the present value of the differences between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in place lease and ii management s estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in place lease 
fair market lease rates are measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below market rate renewal options for below market leases 
in computing present value  we consider the costs which would need to be invested to achieve the fair market lease rates 
we use a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired 
the capitalized above market lease values are amortized as a reduction of base rental revenue over the remaining term of the respective leases  and the capitalized below market lease values are amortized as an increase to base rental revenue over the remaining initial terms plus the terms of any below market renewal options of the respective leases 
other intangible assets acquired include in place leases and tenant relationships which are valued based on management s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease and our overall relationship with the respective tenant 
factors considered by management in its analysis of in place lease values include an estimate of the dark value of the property  carrying costs during the hypothetical expected time it would take management to find a tenant to lease the space for the existing lease term a lease up period considering current market conditions  and costs to execute similar leases 
management estimates carrying costs  including such factors as real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses during the expected lease up period  considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases 
in estimating costs to execute similar leases  management considers leasing commissions and other related expenses 
characteristics considered by management in valuing tenant relationships include the nature and extent of our existing business relationships with the tenant  growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant  the tenant s credit quality and expectations of lease renewals 
the value of in place leases is amortized to expense over the remaining initial terms of the respective leases 
the value of tenant relationship intangibles is amortized to expense over the anticipated life of the relationships 
through december   we have assigned no value to tenant relationships on any of our acquisitions 
commercial mortgage backed securities 
under applicable accounting guidance  we estimate the fair value on our investments in securities quarterly 
management evaluates a variety of inputs and then estimates fair value based on those inputs 
the primary inputs evaluated by management are broker quotations  index pricing  market yields and credit spreads on securities with similar credit ratings and duration  collateral values  and liquidity of the security 
our estimates of fair value are subject to significant variability based on market conditions  including interest rates and credit spreads 
we are then required under gaap to assess whether any unrealized losses on securities below our carry value reflect a decline in value which is other than temporary 
if an other than temporarily impaired security is intended to be sold or required to be sold prior to the recovery of its carrying amount  the full amount of the impairment loss is charged to earnings 
otherwise  losses on the security must be separated into two categories  the portion which is considered credit loss  which is charged to earnings  and the portion due to other factors  which is charged to other comprehensive income loss  a component of balance sheet equity 
significant judgment is required in this analysis 
current credit market conditions have made these judgments even more challenging 
in determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary  we consider whether the decline is due to factors such as changes in interest rates or credit spreads indicator of temporary decline or credit rating downgrades on the securities or credit defaults on the underlying collateral assets indicator of an other than temporary decline 
in estimating other than temporary impairment losses  management considers a variety of factors including the financial condition and near term prospects of the credit  including credit rating of the security and the underlying tenant and an estimate of the likelihood and expected timing of any default  whether we expect to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery in fair value  the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been below cost  current market conditions  expected cash flows from the underlying collateral and an estimate of underlying collateral values  and subordination levels within the securitization pool 
these estimates are highly subjective and could differ materially from actual results 
we recorded other than temporary impairment losses on our cmbs securities of million in  million in  million in stock based compensation 
pursuant to our stock incentive plan  we have made and expect to continue to make awards of common stock to our employees with vesting subject to attainment of performance criteria 
under applicable accounting guidance  we are required to estimate the probability of vesting of these shares quarterly and recognize expense generally equal to the fair market value of the shares awarded on the grant date for any shares deemed probable to vest over the period the employee is required to perform services to receive the shares 
we base our estimates of probability on an assessment of our actual results against the relevant performance criteria 
these estimates may change over time as our actual results against the criteria are re assessed 
changes in these estimates could have a material impact on the expense we recognize 
property acquisitions during the quarter ended december   we completed the following real estate acquisition 
month acquired tenant location purchase price lease expires net rentable square feet december cooper tire rubber company bartram parkway  franklin  in million may business segments we conduct our business through two operating segments operating real estate including our investments in owned real properties  and debt investments including our loan investments as well as our investments in securities 
segment data for the year ended december  are as follows amounts in thousands corporate unallocated operating real estate debt investments total total revenues total expenses loss on extinguishment of debt income loss from continuing operations total assets segment data for the year ended december  are as follows amounts in thousands corporate unallocated operating real estate debt investments total total revenues total expenses gain on extinguishment of debt provision for income tax loss from continuing operations total assets segment data for the year ended december  are as follows amounts in thousands corporate unallocated operating real estate debt investments total total revenues total expenses gain on extinguishment of debt income loss from continuing operations total assets comparison of year ended december  to the year ended december the following discussion compares our operating results for the year ended december  to the comparable period in revenue 
total revenue decreased million  or  to million 
the decrease was primarily attributable to decreases in rental revenue and interest income 
rental revenue and property expense recoveries  in the aggregate  decreased million  or  to million  primarily reflecting the vacancy of our property in johnston  rhode island during the fourth quarter of interest income decreased million  or  to million during  primarily as a result of lower loan balances and lower interest rates on cash balances 
other revenue decreased million  or  to million  from million  primarily reflecting the lease termination payment we received on the omaha  nebraska properties during expenses 
total expenses decreased million  or  to million 
the decrease in expenses was primarily attributable to higher investment losses in the period  and lower interest expense and depreciation expense in the period  offset in part by higher property expenses in the period 
interest expense decreased million  or  to million  from million 
the decrease in the period resulted primarily from million of lower interest expense on floating rate borrowings resulting from lower borrowings in the period  million of lower interest expense on convertible debt due to repurchases of the convertible debt  million of lower interest expense on property mortgages  million of lower interest expense on the secured term loan and million of lower interest expense on collateralized debt obligations due to repurchases in the company s average balance outstanding and effective financing rate under its floating rate borrowings was approximately million at during the period average one month libor of  compared with approximately million at during the period average one month libor of 
market interest rates remained low during but we cannot predict the level of market interest rates in the future 
property expense increased million  or  to million  primarily reflecting carrying costs associated with the johnston  rhode island property of approximately million and expenses on the omaha  nebraska properties where the leases are now gross and were previously net during when the property was leased to a single tenant 
the net amount of property expenses we incurred in net of expense recoveries from our tenants was million  compared to million in we had losses on investments of million during  compared to losses on investments of million in the losses reflect other than temporary impairment losses primarily on one security investments see note 
the losses reflect a million impairment loss on the johnston  rhode island property that is now vacant see note  an aggregate of million of impairment losses on four assets that were sold during two loans  one property and one security and one asset that was sold during cott property see note  of impairment losses on a mezzanine loan investment see note  and of impairment losses on a security investment see note 
general and administrative expense in was largely unchanged from  as it decreased million  or  to million  from million 
general and administrative expense stock based compensation increased million  or  to million 
the increase was primarily a result of higher share prices year over year  which primarily impacted the value of prior year performance share grants that do not price until the eligible vesting year 
as of december   million of unvested shares fair value at the grant dates is expected to be charged to our consolidated statement of operations ratably over the remaining vesting period through march 
as of december   the grant date fair value for awards of  restricted shares made in   restricted shares made in   restricted shares made in and  restricted shares made in  has not yet been determined because the grant date as defined under relevant accounting guidance had not yet occurred 
depreciation and amortization expense on real property decreased million  or  to million  primarily due to the value of our in place lease on the property in johnston  rhode island being fully amortized at the scheduled lease maturity in july gain loss on extinguishment of debt 
we had million of non cash gains on extinguishment of debt in  compared to a loss of in the period 
these amounts related primarily to repurchases of our convertible senior notes see note 
net loss 
net loss decreased million  to million in  from million in  as lower loss on investments  interest expense and depreciation and amortization expense on real property during was substantially offset by lower revenues and gain on debt extinguishment and higher property expenses during net loss allocable to common stockholders was million in  reflecting dividends to preferred stockholders of million 
comparison of year ended december  to the year ended december the following discussion compares our operating results for the year ended december  to the comparable period in revenue 
total revenue decreased million  or  to million 
the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in interest income 
rental revenue and property expense recoveries  in the aggregate  was basically unchanged  as it decreased million  or less than one percent  to million 
while we had one tenant vacancy during johnston  rhode island property  the impact on revenue during was modest as the tenant held over for three months beyond the scheduled lease maturity in july and paid higher rent during the holdover period 
interest income decreased million  or  to million during  primarily as a result of lower loan balances and lower interest rates on cash balances 
other revenue increased million  or  to million  primarily reflecting the lease termination payment we received on the omaha  nebraska properties during expenses 
total expenses decreased million  or  to million 
the decrease in expenses was primarily attributable to lower interest expense and various other expenses in the period  offset in part by higher investment losses in the period 
interest expense decreased million  or  to million  from million 
the decrease in the period resulted primarily from million of lower interest expense on floating rate borrowings resulting from lower borrowings and interest rates in the period  million of lower interest expense on convertible debt due to repurchases of the convertible debt  million of lower interest expense on property mortgages and million of lower interest expense on the secured term loan 
the company s average balance outstanding and effective financing rate under its floating rate borrowings was approximately million at during the period average one month libor of  compared with approximately million at during the period average one month libor of 
market interest rates were low during but we cannot predict the level of market interest rates in the future 
depreciation and amortization expense on real property decreased million  or  to million  primarily due to the value of our in place lease on the property in johnston  rhode island being fully amortized at the scheduled lease maturity in july property expense increased million  or  to million  reflecting increased expenses including costs paid to one of our tenants and real estate taxes 
the net amount of property expenses we incurred in net of expense recoveries was million  compared to million in we had no loss on derivatives in  compared to a million loss on derivatives in the period 
the loss in the period relates primarily to million of losses we realized in november when we closed our only open hedge position 
as of december  and during most of  we had a single open interest rate swap  intended to manage our exposure to interest rate movements for a planned long term financing of assets financed on our credit agreement with wachovia bank 
during november  we closed the swap as a result of unprecedented credit market dislocations and associated declines in the year treasury and other benchmark market interest rates 
the full amount of the realized loss on closing the swap of million  along with million of related losses previously deferred in other comprehensive income loss on our consolidated balance sheet  were charged directly to our consolidated statement of operations  as the swap position no longer represented an effective cash flow hedge under applicable accounting guidance 
we currently have no open hedge positions and did not have any open hedge positions during or loss on investments was million in  compared to million in the losses reflect a million impairment loss on the johnston  rhode island property that is now vacant see note  an aggregate of million of impairment losses on four assets that were sold during two loans  one property and one security and one asset that was sold during cott property see note  of impairment losses on a mezzanine loan investment see note  and of impairment losses on a security investment see note

the increase was primarily a result of an additional year of stock awards and an increase in estimated vesting percentage in the period  offset in part by reduced amortization expense related to the vesting of prior year awards 
as of december   million of unvested shares fair value at the grant dates is expected to be charged to our consolidated statement of operations ratably over the remaining vesting period through march 
as of december   the grant date fair value for awards of  restricted shares made in   restricted shares made in   restricted shares made in and  restricted shares made in  had not yet been determined because the grant date as defined under relevant accounting guidance had not yet occurred

gains in the period related to the repurchase of our convertible senior notes and cdo debt see note 
gains in the period related to the repurchase of our convertible senior notes in december see note net loss 
net loss decreased to million in  from million in  primarily as a result of lower interest expense in the period 
net loss allocable to common stockholders was million in  reflecting dividends to preferred stockholders of million 
funds from operations funds from operations  or ffo  is a non gaap financial measure 
we believe ffo is a useful additional measure of our performance because it facilitates an understanding of our operating performance after adjustment for real estate depreciation  a non cash expense which assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
in addition  we believe that ffo provides useful information to the investment community about our financial performance as compared to other reits  since ffo is generally recognized as an industry standard for measuring the operating performance of an equity reit 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and is not indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income or earnings per share determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of our operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
since all companies and analysts do not calculate ffo in a similar fashion  our calculation of ffo may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
we calculate ffo in accordance with standards established by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit which defines ffo as net income loss computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
the following table reconciles our net income loss allocable to common stockholders to ffo for the years ended december   december  and december  year ended december  in thousands  except per share amounts net loss allocable to common stockholders add deduct non controlling interest in consolidated subsidiaries depreciation and amortization expense on real property depreciation and amortization expense on discontinued operations funds from operations weighted average number of common shares outstanding  diluted weighted average number of op units outstanding weighted average number of common shares and op units outstanding  diluted net loss per common share  basic and diluted funds from operations per share liquidity and capital resources short term liquidity 
we define our short term liquidity as our ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet day to day operating expenses and material cash commitments over the next twelve months 
our primary sources of short term liquidity are available cash and cash equivalents  cash provided by operations  and a portion of the cash proceeds from issuances of debt and equity capital 
we may also use revolving loan borrowings under our credit agreement with wells fargo bank to finance  likely on a short term basis  a portion of our new investment activity 
as of december   we had million in available cash and cash equivalents 
as of february   we had million in available cash and cash equivalents 
we believe that our sources of short term liquidity will be sufficient to enable us to satisfy our short term liquidity requirements  including the payment of our dividend 
as a reit  we are required to distribute at least of our taxable income to our stockholders on an annual basis  and we intend to distribute all or substantially all of our reit taxable income in order to comply with the distribution requirements of the code and to avoid federal income tax and the nondeductible excise tax 
we declared total cash dividends of per share of common stock during the year ended december   including per share in each of the first  second and third quarters  and per share in the fourth quarter 
we declared a cash dividend of per share of series a cumulative redeemable preferred stock in each of the first  second  third and fourth quarters of our dividend policy is subject to revision at the discretion of our board of directors 
all distributions will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our cash available for distribution  our funds from operations  our maintenance of reit status  market conditions and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant 
while we believe we will be able to satisfy our short term liquidity requirements  the following are the primary factors that we believe could have a material adverse effect on our plans payment defaults on our assets which we expect could be triggered primarily in the event of the bankruptcy of the underlying tenant or tenants  unexpected capital expenditures on our owned properties  margin calls on our wells fargo bank credit agreement  or margin calls on any future risk management transactions 
long term liquidity 
we define our long term liquidity as our ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet cash demands and commitments beyond the next months  including balloon payments on our debt obligations and capital expenditures on our owned properties 
our primary sources of long term liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents  cash provided by operations  cash from long term financings on our asset investments and issuances of debt and equity capital 
we may continue to selectively sell assets to allow us to generate additional long term liquidity 
we believe that our various sources of long term liquidity will be sufficient to enable us to satisfy our long term liquidity requirements 
our primary long term liquidity requirement is repayment of our debt obligations 
we intend generally to manage our debt maturities by refinancing or repaying the related debt at maturity 
we expect to utilize a combination of i cash on hand  ii cash from sales of assets which may include the collateral for the debt  and iii cash from future debt or equity capital raises to fund any liquidity needed to satisfy these obligations 
these actions  however  may not enable us to generate sufficient liquidity to satisfy our borrowings and  therefore  we cannot provide any assurance we will be able to refinance or repay our debt obligations as they come due 
our ability to refinance debt  sell assets and or raise capital on favorable terms will be highly dependent upon prevailing market conditions 
see item a risk factors our use of debt financing could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
in this annual report on form k 
we have two recourse debt obligations that are scheduled to mature over the next few years 
our convertible senior notes can be put to us at the option of the note holders for a repurchase price of of the principal amount of the notes in october and our credit agreement with wells fargo bank is scheduled to mature in july the convertible senior notes are unsecured obligations and the credit agreement with wells fargo bank is a secured borrowing agreement 
with respect to the convertible notes  we have through various repurchase transactions reduced the principal amount of notes outstanding to million as of december  from million at original issuance in october 
we may continue to seek to opportunistically repurchase this debt over time and then intend to repay or refinance any remaining obligation at or prior to maturity 
with respect to the wells fargo bank agreement  we entered into an amendment and restatement of the agreement in july  which  among other things  extended the maturity date until july while we believe we will be successful in either refinancing or repaying these obligations at or prior to maturity  we cannot provide any assurance we will be able to do so 
if we are unsuccessful in refinancing these obligations  we may not have sufficient liquidity to repay the debt in full at maturity 
our failure to do so is a default under the debt and could materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results in a variety of ways 
for example  if we default under the wells fargo bank agreement  the bank could foreclose on the related collateral causing us to lose some of our assets 
wells fargo bank and the convertible note holders also would have general recourse against our company if we default in our obligations to them 
in addition  each of these obligations is cross defaulted with the other  meaning that a default under one obligation could result in the other lender accelerating the maturity of our obligations to them 
we have various non recourse mortgage debt obligations that are scheduled to mature in the future beginning in september see the schedule of mortgage note maturities included at note in our consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
in connection with the maturity of our mortgage debt obligations  we intend to evaluate a variety of alternatives with respect to our investment in the subject property  including refinancing the debt  utilizing cash on hand and other sources of liquidity to repay the mortgage debt  and selling the property 
if we are unsuccessful with one or more of these alternatives  we could convey the property to the lender to satisfy in full our obligations under the non recourse debt 
we hold two mortgage note obligations on the travelers corporation property in hartford  connecticut  one scheduled to mature in september and the second in october  and our lease with travelers corporation is scheduled to mature in october the remaining rent payments from travelers will be fully utilized to amortize in full the principal on the note that matures in september  while the note that matures in october does not require current debt service and is scheduled to accrete in value to million due at maturity 
we do not expect travelers to renew its lease at this property 
our willingness to re lease the property will be dependent to a large degree on our ability to either restructure the existing mortgage debt or secure new debt 
if we are unsuccessful in our efforts to restructure the existing debt or secure new debt  we could convey the property to the lender to satisfy in full our obligations under the non recourse mortgage debt  which would trigger an impairment charge on the property with a fully offsetting gain on extinguishment of debt 
the above impairment charge and gain on debt extinguishment  if any  may not be recorded in the same financial reporting period 
our mortgage debt obligations are non recourse and not cross defaulted with our other debt obligations  and therefore  default of any of our mortgage debt obligations will not threaten the viability of our company  although it could result in us losing all or some of our remaining investment in the property 
as an owner of commercial real estate  we will be required to make capital expenditures to maintain and upgrade our properties 
we expect the vast majority of these expenditures will be made as the leases mature and we renew existing leases or find new tenants to occupy the property 
any estimates we make of expected capital expenditures are highly subjective and actual amounts we spend may differ materially and will be impacted by a variety of factors  including market conditions which are beyond our control 
we may be required to incur additional debt  sell assets and or raise capital to generate the liquidity needed to pay for capital expenditures on our properties  and our ability to do so on favorable terms will be highly dependent upon prevailing market conditions 
our ability to satisfy our long term liquidity requirements could be materially adversely affected by capital expenditures we make on our owned properties 
sources of equity capital 
we have implemented a dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase plan and an at the market offering program as defined in rule of the securities act of  as amended  each of which may be utilized by us from time to time to sell shares of our common stock and increase liquidity 
during march  we expanded our at the market offering program to enable us to sell shares of our series a preferred stock and increase liquidity 
during december  we expanded our common stock at the market offering program to include a new sales agent  merrill lynch  pierce fenner smith incorporated 
we completed a refresh of our shelf registration statement in february  and now have an effective shelf registration statement under which we can offer an aggregate of million of common stock  preferred stock and or senior or subordinated debt securities from time to time 
in march  we implemented a dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase plan 
the plan allows interested stockholders to reinvest all or a portion of their cash dividends in shares of our common stock and to make monthly purchases of our common stock generally up to a maximum of  unless a higher amount is approved by us in our sole discretion 
shares purchased through the plan may be either i newly issued by us which may be sold at a discount of up to off of the average of the high and low sales prices on the applicable investment date or ii purchased by the plan administrator in the open market  at our discretion 
during the year ended december   we issued shares of common stock through the plan at a price of per share 
during the year ended december   we issued  shares of common stock through the plan at an average price of per share 
as of december   we have reserved an aggregate of  shares of common stock for future issuance pursuant to the dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase plan 
we issued a small number of new shares through the plan during december and january  at a two percent discount off of the market price of the common stock as determined under the plan 
we are not currently issuing new shares through the plan  although we reserve the right to elect to do so in our sole discretion at any time in the future 
we have entered into a sales agreement with brinson patrick securities corporation that permits us to issue and sell through brinson patrick  from time to time  shares of our common stock and series a preferred stock  and brinson patrick agrees to use its best efforts to sell such shares during the term of the agreement and on the terms set forth therein 
our board of directors initially authorized the sale of up to  shares of common stock and  shares of series a preferred stock through the program from time to time  of which  shares of common stock and  shares of series a preferred stock have been sold 
we are not obligated to sell any shares pursuant to the agreement and we may start and stop selling shares pursuant to the program at any time in our sole discretion 
we must pay brinson patrick a commission of of the gross sales price per share sold 
we have entered into a separate sales agreement with merrill lynch  pierce fenner smith incorporated pursuant to which we may sell  from time to time  up to  shares of common stock through or to merrill lynch  and merrill lynch agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to sell such shares during the term of the agreement and on the terms set forth therein 
we may sell our common stock to merrill lynch as principal for its own account at prices agreed upon at the time of sale 
we are not obligated to sell any shares pursuant to the agreement and we may start and stop selling shares pursuant to the program at any time in our sole discretion 
we must pay merrill lynch a commission of of the gross sales price per share sold

we completed a refresh of our shelf registration statement in february  and now have an effective shelf registration statement under which we can offer an aggregate of million of common stock  preferred stock and or senior or subordinated debt securities from time to time  including an aggregate of  shares of common stock and  shares of series a preferred stock reserved for sale under the brinson patrick sales agreement  and an aggregate of  shares of common stock reserved for sale under the merrill lynch sales agreement 
we intend to continue to raise additional capital from time to time to enable us to continue to implement our strategy 
our ability to raise capital is influenced by market conditions  and we cannot assure you that conditions for raising capital will be favorable for us at any time 
in addition to the stock issuances through our at the market offering program discussed above  we executed the following transactions off of our shelf registration statement during the year ended december  on march   we issued  shares of our common stock to an institutional investor for a price of per share  or net proceeds of approximately million 
on march   we issued  shares of series a cumulative redeemable preferred stock in a public offering at a price of per share  resulting in an effective annual yield of 
we received net proceeds in the transaction after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses of approximately million  including million of accrued dividends 
we have now fully deployed the approximately million of net proceeds from the share issuances we completed in  with million used to reduce recourse indebtedness and the remaining million utilized to fund a portion of the purchase price of the real property we purchased in december leverage 
we rely on leverage to allow us to invest in a greater number of assets and enhance our asset returns 
leverage also exposes us to a variety of risks which are discussed in more detail in our most recent annual report on form k under the heading risk factors 
in reviewing and analyzing our debt  we look at a variety of financial metrics such as our leverage ratios  weighted average and individual interest rates on the debt  weighted average and individual maturity dates and scheduled principal amortization and balloon balances due at maturity 
we also evaluate a variety of subjective factors such as present and expected future market conditions 
leverage ratios are a widely used financial measure by the real estate investment community  especially for reits 
we measure our leverage ratios by dividing total debt by total assets  as adjusted 
we measure total assets  as adjusted  at historical cost before depreciation and amortization on owned properties 
therefore  our leverage ratios do not account for any fluctuations in value  up or down  that may have occurred since we acquired our owned properties 
other companies including other reits may compute leverage ratios in a different manner and  therefore  our leverage ratios may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
the following table sets forth the computation of our overall portfolio leverage ratio as of december   and december  dollars in thousands 
dec  dec  debt mortgages on real estate investments collateralized debt obligations credit agreement secured term loan convertible senior notes other long term debt total debt assets total assets accumulated depreciation and amortization on owned properties intangible liabilities on real estate investments prepaid expenses and deposits accrued rental income debt issuance costs  net other total assets  as adjusted leverage total debt total assets  as adjusted the following table sets forth the computation of our leverage ratios by segment as of december  dollars in thousands

the carry value of our debt investments has been adjusted to exclude a general loss reserve 
we expect our leverage level to continue to decrease over time  as a result of one or more of the following factors scheduled principal amortization on our debt  voluntary debt reduction including potentially through selected asset sales  and lower or no leverage on new asset acquisitions 
our portfolio financing strategy is to finance our assets with long term fixed rate debt as soon as practicable after we invest  generally on a secured  non recourse basis 
through non recourse debt  we seek to limit the overall company exposure in the event we default on the debt to the amount we have invested in the asset or assets financed 
we seek to finance our assets with match funded or substantially match funded debt  meaning that we seek to obtain debt whose maturity matches as closely as possible the maturity of the asset financed 
through december   our long term fixed rate asset financings have been in the form of traditional third party non recourse first mortgage financings on most of our owned real properties and two non recourse term financings  including a secured term loan completed in december and one cdo completed in march 
as of december   we have financed on a long term basis an aggregate of approximately billion of portfolio assets with third party first mortgage debt of million and term financings of million 
long term mortgage financings 
we have financed most of our owned properties through traditional first mortgage financings provided through the commercial mortgage backed securitization market 
we also have utilized the term financings described below to add incremental leverage on many of our owned properties 
during the quarter ended december   we did not obtain any new mortgage financings 
as of december   we had million of non recourse first mortgage debt at a weighted average coupon of and a weighted average effective financing rate of 
our mortgage financings are all fixed rate financings 
the notes typically mature over a long term period of approximately ten years  and debt service is payable monthly 
the notes are non recourse to us subject to limited recourse exceptions and are secured by a mortgage on the property and an assignment of the underlying lease and rents on the property 
the notes are often interest only for all or a portion of the note term  and thus require a balloon payment at maturity 
as described above  we cannot provide any assurance we will be able to refinance or repay these obligations at maturity and our ability to do so on favorable terms will be highly dependent upon prevailing market conditions 
see business environment above and item a risk factors in this annual report on form k 
term financings 
we have financed most of our loan and securities investments as well as a select number of our owned properties through the term financings described below 
as noted above  we have also utilized term financings to add incremental leverage on our owned properties financed with mortgage debt 
in december  we completed a million original principal balance secured term loan 
upon closing of the financing  we pledged approximately million principal amount of collateral to secure our obligations under the loan 
as of december   we had million outstanding under the secured term loan 
the interest coupon on the loan is fixed at annually until the loan matures in january our effective financing rate on the loan is annually inclusive of hedge and closing costs 
the loan is non recourse to us  subject to limited non recourse exceptions 
we also completed an entirely fixed rate cdo financing in march we aggregated approximately million face amount of assets and then transferred these assets into a wholly owned securitization vehicle  and issued million face amount of multi class notes and million face amount of preferred equity through the securitization vehicle 
the assets serve as collateral for our obligations under the notes 
the securitization vehicle is a special purpose entity  or spe  with its business limited to the issuance of the notes and the preferred equity  the acquisition of the collateral and certain other matters related thereto 
the net amount of the debt we initially issued was million  inclusive of a million discount to face  as we retained the three most junior note classes aggregating a face amount of million and the full million face amount of preferred equity 
as of december   we had million outstanding under the cdo 
the cdo notes have a stated maturity in january  although the actual life of the notes is expected to be substantially shorter 
our weighted average effective financing rate inclusive of original issue discount and debt issuance and hedge costs on our cdo is approximately 
our cdo debt is non recourse to us but is secured by the collateral assets 
we reduced the debt outstanding under our cdo by repurchasing million of our class a cdo notes during the year ended december  we have financed certain of our portfolio assets pursuant to a credit agreement we entered into with wells fargo bank in april we entered into an amendment and restatement of the credit agreement with wells fargo in july  which  among other things established a maximum revolving credit commitment of million  extended the maturity date of the credit agreement to july   from april   and set the interest rate on our borrowings at one month libor plus basis points an increase from one month libor plus basis points at june  
also in connection with the july amendment and restatement  we made a million principal payment to the lender and agreed to repay another million of principal in four equal quarterly installments beginning on october   the first two installments of which have been paid 
our outstanding borrowings under the agreement were million as of december  the agreement is a floating rate libor based facility 
our borrowings under the agreement are secured by a combination of first mortgage loan investments  intercompany mortgage loans on our owned property investments  commercial mortgage backed securities and a first lien on our ownership interest in the real property located in johnston  rhode island 
our obligations under the credit agreement are also fully recourse to all of our other assets and  pursuant to the margin call provisions in the agreement  we may be obligated to prepay a portion of the debt if wells fargo determines the value of our collateral has declined  including as a result of an underlying tenant credit rating downgrade or other adverse tenant credit event  wells fargo may require us to prepay a portion of our borrowings  provided that wells fargo may not reduce the value of any of our collateral other than cmbs securities due to general credit spread or interest rate fluctuations 
as of december   we had million borrowed against collateral classified as cmbs securities by wells fargo 
we may utilize the undrawn amount of the lender s revolving credit commitment to finance assets approved by the lender in its sole discretion at an advance rate of of the asset s value as determined by the lender 
we drew million under the credit agreement during december to fund a portion of the purchase price for the cooper tire and rubber company asset discussed under property acquisitions above 
we are required to comply with the following financial covenants under the credit agreement minimum liquidity basically cash and cash equivalents of at least million  minimum consolidated tangible net worth basically stockholders equity before accumulated depreciation and amortization of at least million plus of the aggregate net proceeds from equity offerings or capital contributions after july   maximum corporate leverage basically total liabilities divided by total assets before accumulated depreciation and amortization of and minimum interest coverage basically ebitda  or net income before income taxes  interest expense  depreciation and amortization  divided by interest expense of 
as of december   we were in compliance with the above financial covenants  and we do not currently anticipate any difficulty in maintaining compliance with these covenants in future periods 
we had million outstanding as of december  under our wells fargo credit agreement  which borrowings were secured by loan investments with an aggregate carry value of million  intercompany mortgage loans and investments in our cdo with an aggregate carry value of million  cmbs investments with a carry value of million and a single owned property with a carry value of million 
we may pursue a variety of strategies for the assets financed on the credit agreement  which may include obtaining long term fixed rate financing when market conditions permit  pursuing selected asset sales  and retiring the debt on selected assets and holding the assets unlevered 
we expect credit market conditions to impact our ability to achieve these objectives and  therefore  we cannot provide any assurance as to the timing or our ability to do so 
statement of cash flows operating activities provided million of cash during the year ended december   primarily driven by net loss as adjusted by various non cash gains  losses  income and charges of million 
operating activities provided million of cash during the year ended december   primarily driven by net loss as adjusted by various non cash gains  losses  income and charges of million  partially offset by increases in other assets of million 
operating activities provided million of cash during the year ended december   primarily driven by net loss before the loss on derivatives and as adjusted by various non cash gains  income and charges of million and decreases in other assets of million 
we recognize rental income on our owned properties on a straight line basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
as of december   this has resulted in us accruing million of rental income in excess of actual rents due under the various leases 
during the year ended december   rents on a straight line basis exceeded actual rents due under the leases by million 
we expect the impact of straight lining of rents to fluctuate over time as contractual rents step up and actual rents due increase under the various leases and we purchase additional properties 
certain of our owned properties are also subject to rents which pay semi annually  rather than monthly  and this also impacts the quarter to quarter changes due to straight lining of rents

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in the level of one or more market prices  rate indices or other market factors 
we are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates  credit spreads  tenant credit ratings and equity prices 
we may attempt to mitigate certain of these risks by entering into hedge and other risk management transactions during the short term and fixed rate financings for the long term 
we seek to obtain long term fixed rate financing as soon as practicable after we make an asset investment 
there can be no assurance  however  that such mitigation strategies will be completely or even partially successful 
the level of our exposure to market risk is subject to factors beyond our control  including political risk including terrorism  monetary and tax policy  general economic conditions and a variety of other associated risks 
interest rate exposure we are exposed to interest rate risk in various aspects of our business 
the most significant ways we can be impacted by interest rates are as follows increases in the level of interest rates may impact our ability to add new assets  as spreads on assets we are targeting may compress unless there is a corresponding increase in asset returns 
declines in interest rates could result in increased competition for our asset class 
also  to the extent we finance assets in our portfolio on our floating rate borrowing facilities  our net income from these fixed rate assets will decrease as interest rates rise particularly libor rates and our borrowing cost increases 
our wells fargo credit agreement is currently our only floating rate borrowing facility 
low market interest rates kept our borrowing cost on the wells fargo credit agreement low during and although we cannot predict the level of market interest rates in the future 
in addition  as interest rates rise  our anticipated cost to finance these assets on a long term fixed rate basis may rise  causing our expected spread on these assets to be reduced 
we may attempt to mitigate these risks by entering into risk management transactions that react in a manner that offsets our increased interest costs and by locking our long term financing cost as soon as practicable after we commit to an asset 
as a result of market conditions  we are not currently carrying an open interest rate hedge to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations for assets for which we may obtain long term financing for in the future 
our decision to do so leaves us exposed to increases in long term interest rates for those assets and  therefore  may make it more difficult or more costly to obtain long term financing 
as noted above  there can be no assurance that our mitigation strategies will be successful 
furthermore  shifts in the us treasury yield curve  which represents the market s expectations of future interest rates  would also affect the yield required on our loans and real estate securities 
changes in the required yield would result in a higher or lower value for these assets 
if the required market yields increase as a result of these interest rate changes  the value of our loans and real estate securities would decline relative to us treasuries 
conversely  if the required market yields decrease as a result of interest rate changes  the value of our loans and real estate securities would increase relative to us treasuries 
these changes in the market value may affect the equity on our balance sheet or  if the value is less than our cost basis and we determine the losses to be other than temporary  our statement of operations through impairment losses on our loans or securities 
these value changes may also affect our ability to borrow and access capital 
credit spread curve exposure we are subject to credit spread risk in various aspects of our business 
credit spreads represent the portion of the required yield on an income investment attributable to credit quality 
credit spreads fluctuate over time as investor appetite for credit risk changes 
changes in credit spreads can have many of the same impacts on us as a change in interest rates  or principally increases in credit spreads can result in spread compression on investments we target and  thus  a slowing of our new investment pace  increases in credit spreads can increase our anticipated cost to finance assets not yet financed with long term fixed rate debt  causing our expected spread on these assets to be reduced  and increases in credit spreads can lower the value of our loans and securities as required yields on these assets increase 
tenant credit rating exposure substantially all of our portfolio assets are subject to risks due to credit rating changes of the underlying tenant or tenants 
deterioration in the underlying tenant s credit rating can result in a lower value for the related asset  which could result in a reduction in the equity on our balance sheet or  if the value is less than our cost basis and we determine the loss to be other than temporary  an impairment loss on our statement of operations 
in addition  declines in the credit rating of a particular tenant prior to our obtaining long term fixed rate financing could result in a margin call by the related lender  and precipitous declines may significantly impede or eliminate our ability to finance the asset 
we manage these risks by maintaining diversity among our credits and assessing our aggregate exposure to ratings classes  in particular lower rated classes 
we also seek to lock or procure long term financing on our assets as promptly as practicable after we commit to invest 
equity price risk exposure we may seek to raise capital by sale of our common stock 
our ability to do so is dependent upon the market price of our common stock and general market conditions 
any sales we make may be dilutive to existing stockholders 
fair value for certain of our financial instruments  fair values are not readily available since there are no active trading markets as characterized by current exchanges between willing parties 
accordingly  we derive or estimate fair values using various valuation techniques  such as computing the present value of estimated future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved 
however  the determination of estimated cash flows may be subjective and imprecise 
changes in assumptions or estimation methodologies can have a material affect on these estimated fair values 
the fair values indicated below are indicative of the interest rate and credit spread environment as of december   and december   as the case may be  and may not take into consideration the effects of subsequent interest rate or credit spread fluctuations  or changes in the ratings of the underlying tenants

we have estimated the fair value of this portfolio of loans with a discounted cash flow analysis  utilizing scheduled cash flows and discount rates estimated by management to approximate those that a willing buyer and seller might use 
the maturity dates for the loans range from through commercial mortgage backed securities represent subordinate interests in securitizations  as well as pass through certificates representing our pro rata investments in a pool of mortgage loans collectively  cmbs 
structuring fees receivable represent cash flows receivable by us from the sale of loans to third party purchasers 
the notional values for the cmbs are shown at their respective face amounts 
the fair values of cmbs reflect management s best estimate and require a considerable amount of judgment and assumptions 
management evaluates a variety of inputs and then estimates fair value based on those inputs 
the primary inputs evaluated by management are broker quotations  collateral values  subordination levels  and liquidity of the security 
fair value for the structuring fees receivable is shown at our amortized cost for these items 
for the cmbs  we expect to receive monthly interest coupon payments  and contractual principal payments as scheduled 
our credit agreement bears interest at floating rates  and we believe that for similar financial instruments with comparable credit risks  the effective rates approximate market value 
accordingly  the carrying amounts outstanding are believed to approximate fair value 
we estimate the fair value of mortgage notes on real estate investments  collateralized debt obligations and the secured term loan using a discounted cash flow analysis  based on our estimates of market interest rates 
for mortgages where we have an early payment right  we also consider the prepayment amount to evaluate the fair value
