license fees the company incorporates software licensed from various vendors into its proprietary software 
in addition  third party  stand alone software is required to operate streamline health s proprietary software 
the company licenses these software products  and pays the required license fees when such software is delivered to customers 
employees as of january   streamline health had full time employees  a net decrease of during the fiscal year 
the company utilizes independent contractors to supplement its staff  as needed 
none of the company s employees are represented by a labor union or subject to a collective bargaining agreement 
the company has never experienced a work stoppage and believes that its employee relations are good 
key personnel streamline health s success depends  to a significant degree  on its management  sales and technical personnel 
streamline health must recruit  motivate and retain highly skilled managers  sales force  consulting and technical personnel  including application programmers  database specialists  consultants and system architects skilled in the technical environments in which streamline health s systems operate 
competition for such technical expertise is intense 
the failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse impact on the company 
regulatory matters the us department of health and human services hhs asked the institute of medicine of the national academy of sciences to design a standardized model of an electronic health record  in a move that may help spur nationwide acceptance of ehr s 
the impact of such a change  if implemented by hhs  on current streamline health systems and services is unknown at this time 
however  streamline health believes that its systems are sufficiently flexible to accommodate changing regulatory requirements 
patient privacy is of utmost concern  as evidenced by current hipaa regulations 
streamline health s systems enable a healthcare organization to lock down protected health information  as defined by hipaa  by preventing unauthorized access and providing audit trails for every occurrence of access to phi 
regulations relating to confidentiality federal and state laws regulate the confidentiality of patient records and the circumstances under which such records may be released 
these regulations govern both the disclosure and use of protected health information phi 
regulations governing electronic health data privacy are continuing to evolve 
the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa of  enacted august   is designed to improve the efficiency of healthcare by standardizing the interchange of specified electronic data  and to protect the security and confidentiality of phi 
the legislation requires that covered entities comply with national standards for certain types of electronic health information transactions and the data elements used in such transactions  and adopt policies and practices to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of phi 
regulations adopted pursuant to hipaa include rules addressing several areas 
the privacy rule also extended the scope of enforcement to phi residing on non electronic media  such as paper  as well as to email  oral and written communications 
streamline health cannot predict the potential impact of new or revised regulations that have not yet been released or made final  or any other regulations that might be adopted 
congress may adopt legislation that may change  override  conflict with  or preempt the currently issued regulations 
additionally  legislation governing the dissemination of patient health information is also from time to time proposed and debated at the state level 
these laws or regulations  when adopted  could restrict the ability of customers to obtain  use  or disseminate phi 
streamline health believes that the features and architecture of streamline health s systems are such that it currently supports or should be able to make the necessary modifications to its products  if required  to ensure support of the hipaa regulations  and other legislation or regulations 
however  if the regulations are unduly restrictive  this could cause delays in the delivery of new versions of software and adversely affect the licensing of streamline health s software 
overall  streamline health believes the hipaa regulations will continue to stimulate healthcare organizations to purchase computer based ehr systems that automate the collection  use  and disclosure of phi  while maintaining appropriate security and audit controls over the information 
however  there can be no assurance that an increase in the purchase of new systems or additional use of streamline health software and services will occur 
the company has not yet been able to measure any direct benefit from hipaa regulations  and cannot be certain that we will be a direct financial beneficiary of any of its provisions in the future 
limited protection of proprietary technology the success of streamline health depends on the protection of its intellectual property rights relating to its proprietary technology 
streamline health relies on a combination of confidentiality  nondisclosure  license  employment agreements  trade secret laws  copyrights  and restrictions on the disclosure of its intellectual property 
notwithstanding these precautions  others may copy  reverse engineer or design independently  technology similar to streamline health s products 
it may be necessary to litigate to enforce or defend streamline health s proprietary technology or to determine the validity of the intellectual property rights of others 
streamline health could also be required to defend itself against claims made by third parties for intellectual property right infringement 
any litigation  could be successful or unsuccessful  may result in substantial cost and require significant attention by management and technical personnel 
item a risk factors see also  part i  item  business 
the following is a list of risk factors that affect the company 
they are not listed in any particular order or relative importance and no inferences should be given to the listing order 
in addition  risks and uncertainties not currently known to the company or that the company currently deems to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect the company  its financial condition and or operating results 
the variability of the company s quarterly operating results can be significant 
the company s operating results have fluctuated from quarter to quarter in the past  and the company may experience continued fluctuations in the future 
future revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of a number of factors  many of which are outside the control of the company 
these factors include the relatively large size of customer agreements  unpredictability in the number and timing of system sales and sales of applications hosting services  length of the sales cycle  delays in installations  changes in customers financial condition or budgets  increased competition  the development and introduction of new products and services  the loss of significant customers or remarketing partners  changes in government regulations  particularly as to the healthcare industry  the size and growth of the overall healthcare information technology markets  any liability and other claims that may be asserted against the company  the company s ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  national and local general economic and market conditions  and other factors referenced or incorporated by reference in this form k and any other filings by the company with the securities and exchange commission 
the company s sales have been concentrated in a small number of customers 
the company s revenues have been concentrated in a relatively small number of large customers  and the company has historically derived a substantial percentage of its total revenues from a few customers 
there can be no assurance that a customer will not cancel all or any portion of a master agreement or delay installations 
a termination or installation delay of one or more phases of an agreement  or the failure of streamline health to procure additional agreements  could have a material adverse effect on streamline health s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
in addition to direct sales  the company relies on third party remarketing alliances for a substantial portion of its revenues 
the company seeks to expand its distribution channels by creating remarketing alliances with third parties who are engaged in the sale of healthcare information systems  medical records management and outsourcing  and other healthcare information technology and patient care solutions 
ge healthcare and telus health  the company s major remarketing partners  could choose to discontinue reselling streamline health products  and significant customers could elect to discontinue using the company s products 
the company needs to ensure that it expands its distribution channels to reduce the reliance on a single major reseller 
if we are unable to maintain and grow the company s remarketing relationship with ge healthcare or enter into new remarketing agreements  or similar alliances  failure to do so could be materially adverse to the growth of our base business 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  streamline health learned of planned organizational changes by ge healthcare which could adversely affect streamline health s core technology s sales 
if streamline health s existing remarketing agreement with ge healthcare is terminated  or fails to generate future new business  or the company is unable to enter other agreements with leading healthcare service providers  the company may be unable to maintain or increase market presence 
ge may have multiple relationships with other third parties and ge may not regard the company as significant to ge s business 
ge healthcare may pursue relationships with our competitors or develop or acquire products and services that compete with our products and services 
ge healthcare may formally terminate its relationship with the company with little or no notice 
a significant increase in new application hosting services contacts could reduce near term profitability and require a significant cash outlay which could adversely affect near term cash flow 
if new or existing customers purchase significant amounts of remote application hosting services  the company may have to expend a significant amount of initial setup costs and time before those new customers are able to begin using such services  and the company cannot begin to recognize revenues from those hosting agreements until the commencement of such services 
accordingly  the company anticipates that its near term cash flow  revenue and profitability may be adversely affected by significant incremental setup costs from new hosted customers that would not be offset by revenue until new hosting customers go into production 
while the company anticipates long term growth in profitability through increases in recurring hosting subscription fees and significantly improved profit visibility  any inability to adequately finance setup costs for new application hosting services  could result in the failure to put new hosted services into production  and could have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity  financial position and results of operations 
unsuccessful implementation of the company s products and services with our customers may harm our future financial success 
the company s new customer projects could be complex and require lengthy and significant work to implement our products and services 
each customer s situation may be different  and unanticipated difficulties and delays may arise as a result of failure by us or by the customer to meet respective implementation responsibilities 
if the customer implementation process is not executed successfully or if execution is delayed  our relationships with some of our customers may be adversely impacted and our results of operations could be impacted negatively 
in addition  cancellation of any implementation of our products and services after it has begun may involve loss to us of time  effort and resources invested in the cancelled implementation as well as lost opportunity for acquiring other customers over that same period of time 
if we are forced to reduce our prices  our business  financial condition and results of operations could suffer 
the company may be subject to pricing pressures with respect to our future sales arising from various sources  including practices of managed care organizations  and government action affecting reimbursement under medicare  medicaid and other government health programs 
the company s customers and the other entities with which we have a business relationship are affected by changes in statutes  regulations and limitations in governmental spending for medicare  medicaid and other programs 
recent government actions and future legislative and administrative changes could limit government spending for the medicare and medicaid programs  limit payments to hospitals and other providers  increase emphasis on competition  impose price controls and create other programs that potentially could have an adverse effect on our customers and the other entities with which we have a business relationship 
if our pricing experiences significant downward pressure  our business will be less profitable and our results of operations would be adversely affected 
in addition  because cash from sales funds some of our working capital requirements  reduced profitability could require us to raise additional capital sooner than we would otherwise need 
the company needs to manage its costs while planning for growth 
the company s planned growth through its remote application hosting line of business could continue to place a significant strain on the company s cash flow 
this could also strain the services and support operations  sales and administrative personnel and other resources as they are requested to handle the added work load with existing support resources 
streamline health believes that it must continue to focus on these remote hosting services  develop new products  enhance existing solutions and serve the needs of its existing and anticipated customer base 
the company s ability to successfully maintain and expand its operations will depend  in large part  upon its ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees 
the company s ability to manage its planned growth effectively also will require the company to continue to improve its operational  management  and financial systems and controls  to train  motivate  and manage its employees and to judiciously manage its operating expenses in anticipation of increased future revenues 
consolidation in the healthcare industry could adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
many healthcare industry participants are consolidating to create integrated healthcare delivery systems with greater market power 
as provider networks and managed care organizations consolidate  thus decreasing the number of market participants  competition to provide products and services like ours will become more intense  and the importance of establishing relationships with key industry participants will become greater 
these industry participants may try to use their market power to negotiate price reductions for our products and services 
further  consolidation of management and billing services through integrated delivery systems may decrease demand for our products 
if we were forced to reduce our prices  our business would become less profitable unless we were able to achieve corresponding reductions in our expenses 
the potential impact on the company of new or changes in existing federal  state  and local regulations governing healthcare information could be substantial 
healthcare regulations issued to date have not had a material adverse affect on the company s business 
however  the company cannot predict the potential impact of new or revised regulations that have not yet been released or made final  or any other regulations that might be adopted 
congress may adopt legislation that may change  override  conflict with  or preempt the currently existing regulations and which could restrict the ability of customers to obtain  use  or disseminate patient health information 
streamline health believes that the features and architecture of its existing solutions are such that it currently supports or should be able to make the necessary modifications to its products  if required  to ensure support of hipaa regulations  and other legislation or regulations  but there can be no assurances 
the healthcare industry is highly regulated 
any material changes in the political  economic or regulatory healthcare environment that affect the group purchasing business or the purchasing practices and operations of healthcare organizations  or that lead to consolidation in the healthcare industry  could require us to modify the company s services or reduce the funds available to providers to purchase our products and services 
our business  financial condition and results of operations depend upon conditions affecting the healthcare industry generally and hospitals and health systems particularly 
our ability to grow will depend upon the economic environment of the healthcare industry generally as well as our ability to increase the number of solutions that we sell to our customers 
the healthcare industry is highly regulated and is subject to changing political  economic and regulatory influences 
factors such as changes in reimbursement policies for healthcare expenses  consolidation in the healthcare industry  regulation  litigation  and general economic conditions affect the purchasing practices  operation and  ultimately  the operating funds of healthcare organizations 
in particular  changes in regulations affecting the healthcare industry  such as any increased regulation by governmental agencies of the purchase and sale of medical products  or restrictions on permissible discounts and other financial arrangements  could require us to make unplanned modifications of our products and services  or result in delays or cancellations of orders or reduce funds and demand for our products and services 
the company s customers derive a substantial portion of their revenue from third party private and governmental payors  including medicare  medicaid and other government sponsored programs 
our sales and profitability depend  in part  on the extent to which coverage of and reimbursement for medical care provided is available from governmental health programs  private health insurers  managed care plans and other third party payors 
if governmental or other third party payors materially reduce reimbursement rates or fail to reimburse our customers adequately  our customers may suffer adverse financial consequences which  in turn  may reduce the demand for and ability to purchase our products or services 
the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa of  enacted august   is designed to improve the efficiency of healthcare by standardizing the interchange of specified electronic data  and to protect the security and confidentiality of protected health information 
hipaa requires that covered entities comply with national standards for certain types of electronic health information transactions and the data elements used in such transactions  and adopt policies and practices to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of protected health information 
streamline health believes that the features and architecture of streamline health s solutions are such that it currently supports or should be able to make the necessary modifications to its products  if required  to ensure support of the hipaa regulations  and other subsequent hipaa legislation or regulations 
however  if the regulations are unduly restrictive  this could cause delays in the delivery of new versions of solutions and adversely affect the licensing of the company s solutions 
however  there can be no assurance that an increase in the purchase of new systems or additional use of streamline health software and services will occur 
in february  the united states congress enacted the hitech act  as part of the american recovery and reinvestment act of the hitech act requires that hospitals and health systems make investments in their clinical information systems  including the adoption of electronic medical records 
while we believe that increased emphasis on electronic medical records by hospitals and health systems will also drive demand for saas based tools  such as ours  to help rationalize and standardize patient and clinical data for efficient and accurate use  we cannot be certain whether or when such demand will materialize nor can we be certain that we will benefit from it 
in march  president obama signed into law the patient protection and affordable care act  amended by the health care and education and reconciliation act of collectively  the affordable care act 
the affordable care act is a sweeping measure designed to expand access to affordable health insurance  control health care spending  and improve health care quality 
the law includes provisions to tie medicare provider reimbursement to health care quality and incentives  mandatory compliance programs  enhanced transparency disclosure requirements  increased funding and initiatives to address fraud and abuse  and incentives to state medicaid programs to promote community based care as an alternative to institutional long term care services  among many others 
in addition  the law provides for the establishment of a national voluntary pilot program to bundle medicare payments for hospital and post acute services  which could lead to changes in the delivery of health care services 
likewise  many states have adopted or are considering changes in health care policies as a result of state budgetary shortfalls 
the timetable for implementing many provisions of the affordable care act remains unsettled  and we do not know what effect federal or state law proposals may have on our business 
streamline health faces significant competition  including from companies with significantly greater resources 
the company currently competes with many other companies for the licensing of similar software solutions and related services 
several companies historically have dominated the clinical information systems software market and several of these companies have either acquired  developed or are developing their own document management and workflow technologies 
the industry is undergoing consolidation and realignment as companies position themselves to compete more effectively 
many of these companies are larger than streamline health and have significantly more resources to invest in their business 
in addition  information and document management companies serving other industries may enter the market 
suppliers and companies with whom streamline health may establish strategic alliances may also compete with streamline health 
such companies and vendors may either individually  or by forming alliances excluding streamline health  place bids for large agreements in competition with streamline health 
a decision on the part of any of these competitors to focus additional resources in the image enabling  workflow  and other markets addressed by streamline health could have a material adverse effect on streamline health 
the healthcare industry is evolving rapidly  which may make it more difficult for the company to be competitive in the future 
the united states healthcare system is under intense pressure to improve in many areas  including modernization  universal access and controlling skyrocketing costs of care 
streamline health believes that the principal competitive factors in its market are customer recommendations and references  company reputation  system reliability  system features and functionality including ease of use  technological advancements  customer service and support  breadth and quality of the systems  the potential for enhancements and future compatible products  the effectiveness of marketing and sales efforts  price and the size and perceived financial stability of the vendor 
in addition  the company believes that the speed with which companies in its market can anticipate the evolving healthcare industry structure and identify unmet needs are important competitive factors 
there can be no assurance that streamline health will be able to keep pace with changing conditions and new developments such that it will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or potential competitors 
rapid technology changes and short product life cycles could harm streamline health s business 
the market for streamline health s solutions and services is characterized by rapidly changing technologies  regulatory requirements  evolving industry standards and new product introductions and enhancements that may render existing solutions obsolete or less competitive 
as a result  streamline health s position in the healthcare information technology market could change rapidly due to unforeseen changes in the features and functions of competing products  as well as the pricing models for such products 
the company s future success will depend  in part  upon the company s ability to enhance its existing solutions and services and to develop and introduce new solutions and services to meet changing requirements 
the company needs to maintain an ongoing research and development program to continue to develop new solutions and apply new technologies to its existing products  but may not have sufficient funds with which to undertake such required research and development 
if the company is not able to foresee changes and or to react in a timely manner to such developments  the company may experience a material  adverse impact on its business  operating results  and financial condition 
streamline health s intellectual property rights are valuable  and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of streamline health s solutions and services 
the company trademarks and copyrights its intellectual property  which represents an important asset to the company 
streamline health does not have any patent protection on any of its software 
the company relies upon license agreements  employment agreements  confidentiality  nondisclosure agreements  etc 
to maintain the confidentiality of streamline health s proprietary information and trade secrets 
notwithstanding these precautions  others may copy  reverse engineer or design independently  technology similar to streamline health s products 
if the company fails to adequately protect the intellectual property through trademarks and copyrights  license agreements  employment agreements  confidentiality  nondisclosure agreements  etc  the intellectual property rights may be misappropriated by others  invalidated  or challenged  and our competitors could duplicate the company s technology or may otherwise limit any competitive technology advantage the company may have 
it may be necessary to litigate to enforce or defend streamline health s proprietary technology or to determine the validity of the intellectual property rights of others 
any litigation  could be successful or unsuccessful  may result in substantial cost and require significant attention by management and technical personnel 
the company could be subjected to claims of intellectual property infringement  which claims could be expensive to defend 
while the company does not believe that its products and services infringe upon the intellectual property rights of third parties  the potential for intellectual property infringement claims continually increases as the number of software patents and copyrighted and trademarked materials continues to rapidly expand 
any claim for intellectual property right infringement  even if not meritorious  would be expensive to defend 
if the company were to become liable for infringing third party intellectual property rights  the company could be liable for substantial damage awards  and potentially be required to cease using the technology  to produce non infringing technology  or to obtain a license to use such technology 
such potential liabilities or increased costs could be materially adverse to the company 
third party products are essential to streamline health s software 
streamline health software incorporates software licensed from various vendors into its proprietary software 
in addition  third party  stand alone software is required to operate some of the company s proprietary software modules 
the loss of the ability to use these third party products  or ability to obtain substitute third party software at comparable prices  could have a material adverse affect on the ability to license streamline health software 
streamline health s solutions may not be error free and could result in claims of breach of contract and liabilities 
streamline health s solutions are very complex and may not be error free  especially when first released 
although the company performs extensive testing  failure of any product to operate in accordance with its specifications and documentation could constitute a breach of the license agreement and require streamline health to correct the deficiency 
if such deficiency is not corrected within the agreed upon contractual limitations on liability and cannot be corrected in a timely manner  it could constitute a material breach of a contract allowing the termination thereof and possibly subjecting the company to liability 
also  streamline health sometimes indemnifies its customers against third party infringement claims 
if such claims are made  even if they are without merit  they could be expensive to defend 
streamline health s license agreement generally limits the company s liability arising from claims such as described in the foregoing sentences  but such limits may not be enforceable in some jurisdictions or under some circumstances 
a significant uninsured or under insured judgment against the company could have a material adverse impact on the company 
the company could be liable to third parties from the use of the company s solutions 
the company s solutions provide access to patient information used by physicians and other medical personnel in providing medical care 
the medical care provided by physicians and other medical personnel are subject to numerous medical malpractice and other claims 
the company attempts to limit any potential liability of the company to customers by limiting the warranties on its solutions in the company s agreements with the company s customer  the healthcare provider 
however  such agreements do not protect the company from third party claims by patients who may seek damages from any or all persons or entities connected to the process of delivering patient care 
the company maintains insurance  which provides limited protection from such claims  if such claims against the company would result in liability to the company 
although no such claims have been brought against the company to date regarding injuries related to the use of our solutions  such claims may be made in the future 
a significant uninsured or under insured judgment against the company could have a material adverse impact on the company 
the company s remote application hosting services and support services could experience interruptions 
the company provides remote hosting services for many clients  including the storage of critical patient  financial and administrative data 
in addition  it provides support services to clients through the client support facility 
the company has redundancies  such as backup generators  redundant telecommunications lines  and backup facilities built into its operations to prevent disruptions 
however  complete failure of all generators or impairment of all telecommunications lines or severe casualty damage to the primary building or equipment inside the primary building housing our hosting center or client support facilities could cause a temporary disruption in operations and adversely affect clients who depend on the application hosting services 
any interruption in operations at its data center or client support facility could cause the company to lose existing clients  impede our ability to obtain new clients  result in revenue loss  cause potential liability to our clients  and increase our operating costs 
the company s remote application hosting services are provided over an internet connection 
any breach of security or confidentiality of protected health information could expose the company to significant expense  and harm to the company s reputation 
the company provides remote hosting services for clients  including the storage of critical patient  financial and administrative data 
the company has security measures in place to prevent or detect misappropriation of protected heath information 
the company must maintain facility and systems security measures to preserve the confidentiality of data belonging to clients as well as their patients that resides on computer equipment in the data center  which we handle via application hosting services  or that is otherwise in the company s possession 
notwithstanding efforts undertaken to protect data  it can be vulnerable to infiltration as well as unintentional lapse 
if confidential information is compromised  the company could face claims for contract breach  penalties and other liabilities for violation of applicable laws or regulations  significant costs for remediation and re engineering to prevent future occurrences  and serious harm to the company s reputation 
the loss of key personnel could adversely affect streamline health s business 
streamline health s success depends  to a significant degree  on its management  sales force and technical personnel 
the company must recruit  motivate  and retain highly skilled managers  sales  consulting and technical personnel  including application programmers  database specialists  consultants  and system architects who have the requisite expertise in the technical environments in which our solutions operate 
competition for such technical expertise is intense 
the company s failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company may not have access to sufficient capital to be competitive in its markets 
streamline health may need additional capital in the form of loans or equity in order to operate and to be competitive 
the company may be limited to the availability of such capital or may not have any availability  in which case the company s future prospects may be materially impaired 
the company must maintain compliance with the terms of its existing credit facilities 
the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to finance its ongoing operations and the company may not be able to find an alternative lending source if a default would occur 
on october   the company entered into an amended and restated revolving credit facility with its existing lender 
upon doing so  the company was able to negotiate modified terms in which the minimum tangible net worth requirement was eliminated 
in the first quarter of fiscal  the company entered into an amended and restated revolving note with fifth third bank  cincinnati  oh 
the terms of the loan remain the same as set forth in the revolving note entered into on july   as amended on january   and october   except as follows i the maximum principal amount that can be borrowed was increased to  from the prior maximum amount of  subject to the borrowing base  ii the maturity date of the loan has been extended to october  from october   iii the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio covenant has been revised  to require that the company shall maintain a minimum trailing twelve months fixed charge coverage ratio of  measured each fiscal quarter  iv the funded indebtedness to ebitda covenant has been revised  to require that the company shall report a funded indebtedness to ebitda ratio no greater than  measured each fiscal quarter and  v a covenant has been added to require that the company s ebitda shall cover its capitalized software development costs each fiscal quarter 
the covenant becomes effective on october  and is calculated based on the trailing nine months 
as of january  and thereafter  the calculation will be based on the trailing twelve months 
there can be no assurances that the company will be able to maintain compliance with all of the continuing covenants and other terms and conditions of this credit facility on an ongoing basis 
if not  the company could be required to pay back the amounts borrowed on an accelerated basis  which could subject the company to decreased liquidity and other negative impacts on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
furthermore  if the company would need to find an alternative lending source  the company may have difficulty in doing so  particularly in the current credit environment which is not favorable to borrowers 
without a sufficient credit facility  the company would be adversely affected by a lack of access to liquidity needed to operate the company s business 
any disruption in access to credit could force the company to take measures to conserve cash  such as deferring important research and development expenses  which measures could have a material adverse effect on the company 
potential disruptions in the credit markets may adversely affect the company s business  including the availability and cost of short term funds for liquidity requirements and our ability to meet long term commitments  which could adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
if internal funds are not available from operations  the company may be required to rely on the banking and credit markets to meet its financial commitments and short term liquidity needs 
the company s access to funds under its revolving credit facility or pursuant to arrangements with other financial institutions is dependent on the ability of the financial institution s ability to meet funding commitments 
financial institutions may not be able to meet their funding commitments if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience high volumes of borrowing requests from other borrowers within a short period of time 
adverse economic conditions in the united states and globally may have significant effects on the company s customers and suppliers that would result in material adverse effects on the company s business  operating results and stock price 
adverse economic conditions in the united states and globally and the concern that the worldwide economy may enter into a prolonged recessionary period may materially adversely affect the company s customers access to capital or willingness to spend capital on the company s products and services and or their levels of cash liquidity in with which or willingness to pay for products that they will order or have already ordered from the company 
continuing adverse economic conditions would also likely negatively impact the company s business  which could result in reduced demand for the company s products and services  increased price competition for the company s products and services  increased risk of collectability of cash from the company s customers  increased risk in potential reserves for doubtful accounts and write offs of accounts receivable  reduced revenues  and higher operating costs as a percentage of revenues 
all of the foregoing potential consequences of current national or global economic conditions are difficult to forecast and mitigate 
as a consequence  the company s operating results for a particular period are difficult to predict  and  therefore  prior results are not necessarily indicative of future results to be expected in future periods 
any of the foregoing effects could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition and could adversely affect the company s stock price 
the market price of the company s common stock is likely to be highly volatile as the stock market in general can be highly volatile 
the public trading of the company s common stock is based on many factors  which could cause fluctuation in the price of the company s common stock 
these factors may include  but are not limited to general economic and market conditions  actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results  lack of research coverage by securities analysts  conditions or trends in the healthcare information technology industry  changes in the market valuations of other companies in the company s industry  announcements by the company or its competitors of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  divestitures  joint ventures or other strategic initiatives  capital commitments  additional or departures of key personnel  and sales and repurchases of the company s common stock 
many of these factors are beyond the company s control 
these factors may cause the market price of the company s common stock to decline  regardless of the company s operating performance 
the preparation of the company s financial statements requires the use of estimates that may vary from actual results 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make significant estimates that affect the financial statements 
one of the company s most critical estimates is the amount of software development costs to capitalize 
due to the inherent nature of these estimates  the company cannot provide absolute assurance that it will not significantly increase or decrease such estimates upon determination of the actual results 
any required adjustments could have a material adverse effect on the company and its results of operations  and could result in the restatement of the company s prior period financial statements 
changes in accounting standards could impact the company s reported earnings and financial condition 
the accounting standard setters  including the financial accounting standards board  the us securities and exchange commission and other regulatory bodies  periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
these changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how the company records and reports its financial condition and results of operations 
in some cases  the company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively  which could result in the restatement of the company s prior period financial statements 
failure to improve and maintain the quality of internal controls over financial reporting could materially and adversely affect the company s ability to provide timely and accurate financial information about the company 
in connection with the preparation of the financial statements for the company s fiscal year end  management conducted a review of the internal control structure over financial reporting 
no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses were identified 
however  management cannot be certain that deficiencies will not arise in the future or be identified or that the company will be able to correct and maintain adequate controls over financial processes and reporting in the future 
any failure to maintain adequate controls or to adequately implement required new or improved controls could harm operating results or cause failure to meet reporting obligations in a timely and accurate manner 
foreign currency risk the company is a receiver of currencies other than the us dollar 
accordingly  changes in the exchange rates  and in particular a strengthening of the us dollar  will negatively affect the company s net sales and gross margins as expressed in us dollars 
there is also a risk that the company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates 
a limited number of stockholders have the ability to influence the outcome of director elections and other matters requiring stockholder approval 
the company has several individual stockholders who are not affiliated with the company  who beneficially own in the aggregate more than one third of our outstanding common stock 
these non affiliated stockholders  if they act together  could exert substantial influence over matters requiring approval by our stockholders  including the election of directors  the amendment of our certificate of incorporation and by laws and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions 
as to these matters and in other situations  the company s board of directors and management may disagree with these stockholders as to whether the action opposed or supported by them is in the best interest of our stockholders 
this concentration of ownership may discourage  delay or prevent a change in control of the company  which could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their stock as part of a sale of the company and may negatively affect the market price of our common stock

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations see also part  item  business for general and specific descriptions of streamline health s business 
executive overview company initiatives and strategy streamline health s strategy is to continue to service customers by providing solutions which create significant operational and financial efficiencies across the entire healthcare enterprise via the robust capabilities of our document workflow solutions  while continuing to develop cutting edge products and service offerings to increase our market share 
over the past fiscal year  management has taken significant steps to position the company for future growth by improving operational efficiency through re alignment of personnel to better serve customers  market and develop our products  and manage cost 
the company has also re evaluated the core operating metrics to better measure the level of cash generation  operational efficiency  and overall shareholder value 
the company is focused on increasing recurring revenues through our hosted solution delivery model  which will build shareholder value  provide for more predictable annual revenues  and higher operating margins 
streamline health is focused on marketing and further developing its departmental workflow products because we feel there is a significant opportunity to gain market share in an under served product space 
departmental workflow solutions  such as coding workflow and referral order workflow are lower cost  high value add products that can make an immediate financial and operational impact for customers 
these products have a quick time to market and have significantly shorter sales cycles than enterprise document management solutions 
the company s departmental workflows are complemented by the further development of the business process management bpm  and revenue cycle management consulting service offerings 
streamline health consultants work directly with departmental workflow customers to utilize workflow based solutions  referred to as streamline optimization solutions  or sos  which enable customers to streamline their patient financial services  human resources and administrative document centric processes 
bpm is also adding value to the company s development efforts by working directly with a key customer to develop the auditace solution  which automates many of the time intensive tasks within medicare medicaid and private payer insurance reimbursement audit requests 
auditace has proven to be an effective recovery audit contractor rac product offering 
the company s ability to tap into this underserved market with high value add solutions and services will be a major driver of our growth 
also in  the company has continued investing in the accessanyware x software platform research and development 
this development builds on the consolidation of technology platforms onto the microsoft 
net platform  and includes internationalization of the software which was released in accessanyware in january in  we expect accessanyware will be released to us based customers 
the enhanced versions of the accessanyware x products allow for expanded functionality  additional interoperability capabilities with existing third party healthcare health information systems  and shorter development periods for a faster time to market for new products 
we have had positive reception to accessanyware at the installed locations in canada  and the company plans to continue this momentum with future releases of x products 
prior versions of accessanyware are still available for sale  and the company continues to provide full product support for these prior versions  as we anticipate several years before all existing accessanyware customers complete a transition to the accessanyware x platform 
building the recurring revenue stream recurring subscription revenues generated by hosted systems sales provide enhanced visibility for future revenues based on backlog fulfillment from hosted contracts 
typically these systems are sold with a five year contract term  and have had a high percentage of contract renewals after the initial contract term 
we believe that these software as a service type offerings position the company to take advantage of increased market opportunities at the lower end of the healthcare market 
opportunities for these services are growing much faster than the marketplace in general 
the company believes that our hosted services provide us with an advantage in the marketplace  as many of our competitors do not have a comparable offering 
factors that we believe have contributed to this significant shift to the hosted delivery model are cloud computing systems are becoming more main stream and market adoption has increased dramatically over the past few years 
small to mid sized healthcare organizations do not have the capital or the information technology staff to support complex  locally installed software 
economic and regulatory factors  along with reduced access to credit  have forced hospital organizations to reconsider their capital purchases and look to operating lease alternatives  such as streamline health hosted services  to meet their software needs 
hosted services are an excellent hedge against future obsolescence and provide a lower risk alternative to traditional licensed models 
streamline health now provides hosted services to uc health  catholic healthcare west  t

in addition  streamline health has licensed its workflow and document management solutions  which are installed at leading healthcare providers including parkview health  pro health care  peace health  texas health resources  sarasota memorial hospital  the albert einstein healthcare network  beth israel medical center  and memorial sloan kettering cancer center  among others 
product research development  planning  evaluation the company intends to continue product development efforts and enhance the functionality  integration capabilities  and overall value of the products provided to our customers  along with the development of new applications demanded by the marketplace 
in particular  streamline health intends to increase the functionality of its web based applications 
the company has continued to add new features  functionality and workflow applications to our suite of products  including revenue cycle management solutions such as remote coding  remote physician order processing  pre admission registration scanning  insurance verification  explanation of benefits processing  and enterprise compliance solutions 
streamline health has made investments to integrate our market research and product planning efforts to enhance the level of success of future product offerings 
older  less marketable products are also being evaluated for discontinuation  and reallocation of resources committed to those products 
a more focused approach on developing highly marketable products is being implemented that will reduce future costs of development and allow development resources to be focused on new products that have been rigorously analyzed from a value add and customer demand perspective 
strategic partnerships the potential reduction of revenue from a major remarketing partner  ge healthcare  could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to acquire new customers  and or retain existing customers 
the company will continue to seek beneficial partnerships  in addition to those with telus health  mro inc  and standard register currently in place

the data in the table is presented solely for the purpose of reflecting the relationship of various operating elements to revenues for the periods indicated 
fiscal revenue decreased approximately  or  as compared to fiscal a major factor in comparing the year over year variance in licensed system sales is the significant revenue from a single sale of million recorded in fiscal that was associated with the release of accessanyware the company incurred an operating loss of approximately million in fiscal  compared to operating profit of million in fiscal contributing factors to the fiscal loss included  non cash charges relating to impairment of capitalized software development costs  and other tangible and intangible assets  and increased stock based compensation expenses primarily consisting of restricted stock grants for key employee retention

the primary driver of the year over year variance is due to the million proprietary license sale recognized in fiscal as part of the release of accessanyware  as well as increases in cost of sales  and selling  general and administrative expenses 
this was offset by larger non cash items adjusted in ebitda  including an increase of  tax expense due to the increase in valuation allowance  an increase in capitalized software amortization of  and a  impairment charge  and an increase in stock based compensation expense of  comparison of fiscal year with the approximate net increase in working capital deficit of  at january  from january  resulted primarily from the following the  increase in accrued expenses at january  from january  is primarily due to increased severance costs  including an increase in severance accruals of  and an increase in bonus and incentive compensation accruals of  accounts payable decreased  due to the timing of vendor payments at the end of the fiscal year 
the approximate  net increase in current deferred revenues results primarily from the net addition of over  of unearned maintenance revenues from two of the company s canadian customers  and the year over year increase in the volume of proprietary license sales and their associated maintenance revenues 
the remaining increase in current deferred revenues comes from a  reclassification from long term deferred revenues to current for a long term maintenance contract which is in its final year 
these increases were offset by revenue recorded during fiscal the company increased its valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in the amount of  to reduce the net realizable value to  at january   from  at january  please refer to application of critical accounting policies income taxes for further details 
the company extended the term of its working capital credit facility during the first quarter of fiscal please refer to contractual obligations for further details

streamline health relies on ge healthcare for a significant amount of its revenues  the loss of which would have a material adverse affect on future results of operations 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  streamline health learned that ge healthcare was shifting its organizational focus to upgrading its current clients to their latest version software to assist its customers in meeting meaningful use criteria under the hitech act 
streamline health s remarketing agreement with ge healthcare remains in effect  however the impact on streamline health will most likely be a decline in net new sales opportunities from ge healthcare 
streamline health believes that the opportunity to sell into ge healthcare s current client base that does not have streamline health products remains  as well as the continuing ability to sell additional products and services into the existing jointly owed client base through the remarketing agreement 
streamline health expects all signed contracts or purchase orders with ge healthcare to purchase proprietary software  application hosting services  professional services  and maintenance  are to be fully honored

cost of services  maintenance and support as a percentage of services  maintenance and support revenues in and were and  respectively 
the cost of services  maintenance and support includes compensation and benefits for support and professional services personnel and the cost of third party maintenance contracts

the cost of application hosting services in and as a percentage of revenues was and  respectively 
the cost of application hosting services operations is relatively fixed  but subject to inflation for the goods and services it requires

the increase in the backlog is the result of several contracts for new or add on proprietary software licenses  professional services  or third party hardware and software entered into during fiscal at january   streamline health had maintenance agreements purchase orders  from customers and remarketing partners for maintenance  which if fully performed  will generate future revenues of approximately  compared with  at january   through their respective renewal dates in fiscal year and the decrease results primarily from the recognition in fiscal of maintenance revenue from one long term maintenance contract for one large customer 
at january   streamline health had entered into hosting agreements  which are expected to generate revenues in excess of  through their respective renewal dates in fiscal years through the application hosting backlog decreased from the  at january   due to the decreased volume of new hosting business and renewals  and recognized revenues from contracts signed in prior years

the commencement of revenue recognition varies depending on the size and complexity of the system  the implementation schedule requested by the customer and usage by customers of the application hosting services 
therefore  it is difficult for the company to accurately predict the revenue it expects to achieve in any particular period 
streamline health s master agreements generally provide that the customer may terminate its agreement upon a material breach by streamline health  or may delay certain aspects of the installation 
there can be no assurance that a customer will not cancel all or any portion of a master agreement or delay installations 
a termination or installation delay of one or more phases of an agreement  or the failure of streamline health to procure additional agreements  could have a material adverse effect on streamline health s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
application of critical accounting policies streamline health s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires streamline health to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  streamline health evaluates its estimates  including those related to product revenues  bad debts  capitalized software development costs  income taxes  support contracts  stock based compensation expenses  contingencies and litigation 
streamline health bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that streamline health believes are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and revenue recognition 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
streamline health believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company derives revenue from the licensing and sale of systems  either directly to end users or through third party resellers  comprising of internally developed software  third party software and hardware components  product support  maintenance and professional services 
the company also sells the software application through hosting services which also provide high quality  transaction or subscription based document imaging management services from a central data center 
the company recognizes revenue in accordance with asc  software revenue recognition and asc revenue recognition multiple element arrangements 
the company commences revenue recognition when the following criteria all have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the arrangement fees are fixed or determinable  and collection is considered probable if the company determines that any of the above criteria has not been met  the company will defer recognition of the revenue until all the criteria have been met 
multiple element arrangements in arrangements that include multiple elements eg  proprietary software  other third party hardware and software components  post contract customer support pcs installation services  and or training  the company allocates the total revenue to be earned under the arrangement to the elements based on their relative fair value of vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  which is based on the price charged when that element is sold separately 
the amounts representing the fair value of vsoe of the undelivered items such as pcs are deferred until delivered  or recognized pro rata over the service contract  which is typically one year 
software license arrangements the company utilizes the residual method to recognize software license fees provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
under the residual method  the difference between the fair value of vsoe of the undelivered elements and the total arrangement fee is recognized as the license fee upon delivery 
the revenue related to the undelivered elements are deferred until delivered and or recognized pro rata over the term of the related service contract 
billings to customers recorded prior to the recognition of revenues are classified as deferred revenues 
revenues recognized prior to progress billings to customers are recorded as contract receivables 
each contract is reviewed quarterly by management to determine the appropriateness of the revenue recognition criteria applied to the individual contracts based upon the most currently available information as to the status of the contract  the customer comments  if any  and the status of any open or unresolved issues with the customer 
allowance for doubtful accounts accounts and contract receivables are comprised of amounts owed streamline health for licensed software  professional services  including maintenance services and application hosting services 
contracts with individual customers and resellers determine when receivables are due and payable 
in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts  each unpaid receivable greater than ninety days old is reviewed monthly to determine the payment status based upon the most currently available information as to the status of the receivables  the customer comments  if any  and the status of any open or unresolved issues with the customer preventing the payment thereof 
in addition  the financial status of current customers is reviewed monthly to determine the customer s ability to pay their outstanding balance 
corrective action  if necessary  is taken by the company to resolve open issues related to unpaid receivables 
during these monthly reviews  streamline health determines the required allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the unwillingness or inability of its customers or resellers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers or resellers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company s customers typically have been well established hospitals  medical facilities  or major healthcare information systems companies that resell streamline health products  which have good credit histories  and payments have been received within normal time frames for the industry 
however  some healthcare facilities have experienced significant operating losses and limited cash resources as a result of limits on third party reimbursements from insurance companies and governmental entities 
extended payment of receivables is not uncommon from such healthcare facilities 
capitalized software development costs software development costs are accounted for in accordance with asc software costs of software to be sold  leased or marketed 
costs associated with the planning and designing phase of software development  including coding and testing activities necessary to establish technological feasibility are classified as product research and development and are expensed as incurred 
once technological feasibility has been determined  a portion of the costs incurred in development  including coding  testing  and product quality assurance  are capitalized until available for general release to customers  and subsequently reported at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value 
amortization is calculated on a product by product basis and is over the estimated economic life of the software  using the straight line method 
amortization commences immediately following when a product is available for general release to customers 
unamortized capitalized costs determined to be in excess of the net realizable value of a product are expensed at the date of such determination 
streamline health reviews  on an on going basis  the carrying value of its capitalized software development expenditures  net of accumulated amortization 
in the first quarter of fiscal  subsequent to the release of accessanyware in fiscal  the company completed a review by product of the estimated useful lives of its capitalized software development costs 
after reviewing strategic plans  analyzing the historical useful life of the software products  forecasting product life cycles and demand expectations  the company assigned a five year estimated useful life for costs capitalized for accessanyware x products  and revised the estimated useful lives of certain other products from three years to five years 
the product life cycle for accessanyware versions prior to x  have lasted longer than five years 
historical product and customer data shows that many customers remain on the same primary version for five years or more after purchase  or product support and development continue for five years or more 
the company expects accessanyware x products to also have a five year or longer product life cycle based on this historical data  and the estimated product development lifecycle 
in addition  the useful life of the unamortized balance of development costs for prior accessanyware versions should also reflect an approximate five year life from their documented general release dates 
the company intends to actively sell and support these products for a minimum five years while x products are being rolled out 
this same policy will be applied to folderview as it is generally a primary add on component to prior accessanyware versions  and has had a similar historical life cycle 
folderview will be embedded into version upon company review of the revenue projections  the estimated life cycle of accessanyware x products  and the remaining life cycle for prior accessanyware and folderview releases  a five year estimated life is reasonable and proper 
the company accounted for the change in useful life as a change in accounting estimate which is accounted for on a prospective basis effective february  the change in useful lives resulted in a reduction of amortization expense of approximately  for fiscal  as compared to what would have otherwise been recognized under the prior useful lives assigned 
during fiscal  the company performed its annual analysis of current software products both generally available and in process of development 
upon completion of this review  the company deemed the capitalized software development costs of certain software products to be impaired 
unamortized capitalized costs determined to be in excess of the net realizable value of a product were expensed as of january  for all products that were considered impaired  their carrying values were reduced to zero  and an impairment of  was recorded in cost of sales 
all products identified as impaired had reached technical feasibility  but had not yet been released  and therefore were not available for sale to customers 
equity awards stock based compensation the company records equity award expenses in accordance with asc  compensation stock compensation  which requires the expensing of the fair value of the equity award on a straight line basis  over the vesting period 
future grants of equity awards could have a material impact on reported expenses depending upon the number  value and vesting period of future awards 
the fair value of stock options is estimated at the date of grants using a black scholes option pricing model using the following weighted average assumptions of the risk free interest rate  dividend yield  volatility factor of the expected market price of streamline health s common stock  the expected life of stock options and a forfeiture rate 
the company currently estimates volatility by using the historical volatility of our common stock 
the risk free interest rate is the implied yield currently available on us treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected term input to the black scholes model 
we estimate forfeitures using a historical forfeiture rate 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the provisions of asc  income taxes 
assumptions and estimates are used in determining the appropriate amount of expense to record for income taxes 
these assumptions and estimates consider the taxing jurisdictions in which the company operates as well as current tax regulations 
accruals are established for estimates of tax effects for certain transactions  credits  and future projected profitability of the company based on our interpretation of existing facts and circumstances 
if these assumptions and estimates were to change as a result of new evidence or changes in circumstances  the change in estimate could result in a material adjustment to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that its income tax positions and deductions will be sustained on audit and does not anticipate adjustments that will result in a material change to its financial position during the next twelve months 
therefore  no reserves for uncertain tax positions have been recorded as of january  a key assumption in the determination of the recognized tax benefit or provision is the amount of the valuation allowance required to reduce the related deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance reduces the deferred tax assets to a level which will  more likely than not  be realized 
whether the deferred tax assets will be realized depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the deferred tax asset become deductible 
the net deferred tax assets reflect management s estimate of the amount which will  more likely than not  reduce future taxable income 
during fiscal  the company revised its estimates and incrementally increased the valuation allowance by  reducing the net realizable value of the deferred tax assets to  the incremental increase in the valuation allowance was recorded as income tax expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
fair value measurements the company determines fair value measurements using the fair value hierarchy which distinguishes between market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources observable inputs and an entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available unobservable inputs 
the fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels  which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level 
use of non gaap financial measures in order to provide investors with greater insight  allow for a more comprehensive understanding of the information used by management and the board of directors in its financial and operational decision making  the company may supplement the consolidated financial statements presented on a gaap basis in this annual report on form k with the following non gaap financial measures ebitda  adjusted ebitda  and adjusted ebitda margin  and adjusted ebitda per diluted share 
these non gaap financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of company results as reported under gaap 
the company compensates for such limitations by relying primarily on our gaap results and using non gaap financial measures only as supplemental data 
we also provide a reconciliation of non gaap to gaap measures used 
investors are encouraged to carefully review this reconciliation 
in addition  because these non gaap measures are not measures of financial performance under gaap and are susceptible to varying calculations  these measures  as defined by the company  may differ from and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
ebitda  adjusted ebitda  adjusted ebitda margin  and adjusted ebitda per diluted share the company defines i ebitda  as net income loss before net interest expense  income tax expense benefit  depreciation and amortization  ii adjusted ebitda  as net income loss before net interest expense  income tax expense benefit  depreciation  amortization  and stock based compensation expense  iii adjusted ebitda margin  as adjusted ebitda as a percentage of net revenue  and iv adjusted ebitda per diluted share as adjusted ebitda divided by adjusted diluted shares outstanding 
ebitda  adjusted ebitda  adjusted ebitda margin and adjusted ebitda per diluted share are used to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period and provide for a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than gaap measures alone 
these measures assist management and the board and may be useful to investors in comparing the company s operating performance consistently over time as they remove the impact of our capital structure primarily interest charges  asset base primarily depreciation and amortization and items outside the control of the management team taxes 
adjusted ebitda removes the impact of share based compensation expense  which is another non cash item 
adjusted ebitda per diluted share will include incremental shares in the share count that would be considered anti dilutive in a gaap net loss position 
the board of directors and management also use these measures as i one of the primary methods for planning and forecasting overall expectations and for evaluating  on at least a quarterly and annual basis  actual results against such expectations  and  ii as a performance evaluation metric in determining achievement of certain executive and employee incentive compensation programs 
the company s lenders use adjusted ebitda  to assess our operating performance 
the company s working capital credit agreement credit agreement requires delivery of compliance reports certifying compliance with financial covenants certain of which are based on an adjusted ebitda measurement that is the same as the adjusted ebitda measurement reviewed by our management and board of directors 
ebitda  adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are not measures of liquidity under gaap  or otherwise  and are not alternatives to cash flow from continuing operating activities  despite the advantages regarding the use and analysis of these measures as mentioned above 
ebitda  adjusted ebitda  adjusted ebitda margin  and adjusted ebitda per diluted share as disclosed in this annual report on form k  have limitations as analytical tools  and you should not consider these measures in isolation  or as a substitute for analysis of company results as reported under gaap  nor are these measures intended to be measures of liquidity or free cash flow for our discretionary use 
some of the limitations of ebitda  and its variations are ebitda does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  ebitda does not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  ebitda does not reflect the interest expense  or the cash requirements to service interest or principal payments under our credit agreement  ebitda does not reflect income tax payments we are required to make  and although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized often will have to be replaced in the future  and ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements 
adjusted ebitda has all the inherent limitations of ebitda 
to properly and prudently evaluate our business  the company encourages readers to review the gaap financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business 
the company also strongly urges readers to review the reconciliation of gaap net earnings loss to adjusted ebitda  and gaap earnings loss per diluted share to adjusted ebitda per diluted share in this section  along with the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the following table sets forth a reconciliation of ebitda and adjusted ebitda to net income  a comparable gaap based measure  as well as earnings loss per diluted share to adjusted ebitda per diluted share 
all of the items included in the reconciliation from net earnings loss to ebitda to adjusted ebitda and the related per share calculations are either i recurring non cash items or items that management does not consider in assessing the company s on going operating performance 
in the case of the non cash items  management believes that investors may find it useful to assess the company s comparative operating performance because the measures without such items are less susceptible to variances in actual performance resulting from depreciation  amortization and other non cash charges and more reflective of other factors that affect operating performance 
in the case of the other non recurring items  management believes that investors may find it useful to assess the company s operating performance if the measures are presented without these items because their financial impact does not reflect ongoing operating performance 
the following table reconciles net earnings loss to ebitda  adjusted ebitda  adjusted ebitda margin  and adjusted ebitda per diluted share for the fiscal years ended january  and amounts in thousands  except per share data fiscal year adjusted ebitda reconciliation net earnings loss interest expense tax expenses depreciation and other amortization amortization of capitalized software development costs ebitda stock based compensation expense adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin adjusted ebitda per diluted share earnings loss per share diluted interest expense tax expenses depreciation and other amortization amortization of capitalized software development costs stock based compensation expense adjusted ebitda per adjusted diluted share diluted weighted average shares includable incremental shares adjusted ebitda adjusted diluted shares includes a non cash increase to the valuation allowance of  during fiscal fiscal amortization expense includes  of impairment charges for certain capitalized software development costs adjusted ebitda as a percentage of gaap revenues per adjusted diluted weighted average shares the number of incremental shares that would be dilutive under profit assumption  only applicable under a gaap net loss 
if gaap profit is earned in the current period  no additional incremental shares are assumed liquidity and capital resources traditionally  streamline health has funded its operations  working capital needs  and capital expenditures primarily from a combination of cash generated by operations  bank loans  and revolving lines of credit 
streamline health s liquidity is dependent upon numerous factors including i the timing and amount of revenues and collection of contractual amounts from customers  ii amounts invested in research and development  capital expenditures  and iii the level of operating expenses  all of which can vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
streamline health s customers typically have been well established hospitals or medical facilities or major his companies that resell streamline health s products  which have good credit histories and payments have been received within normal time frames for the industry 
however  some healthcare organizations have experienced significant operating losses as a result of limits on third party reimbursements from insurance companies and governmental entities 
agreements with customers often involve significant amounts and contract terms typically require customers to make progress payments 
current economic events  as well as the uncertainty in the credit markets  have adversely affected the availability of financing for some of our customers 
these recent events  to date  have not materially impacted the quality of the company s accounts receivable balances or the ability to access our working capital facility 
streamline health has no significant obligations for capital resources  other than the  borrowed under its working capital facility at january   the non cancelable operating leases of approximately  payable over the next five years  and  for capital leases payable within one year 
capital expenditures for property and equipment in are not expected to exceed  research and development expense  net of capitalized software development expenditures  was  and  in and  respectively 
streamline health capitalized software development expenditures were approximately  and  of in and  respectively 
net cash provided by operations in fiscal was  an increase of approximately  from  in the prior fiscal year 
the increase was primarily the result of a non cash increase in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance of  and impairment charges to capitalized software development costs of  coupled with an increase in stock based compensation expense of approximately  see the consolidated statements of cash flows for the individual components comprising the net cash provided by operating activities 
net cash used in investing activities in fiscal was  a decrease of  from  in the prior fiscal year 
the decrease was primarily the result of decreased capital asset expenditures  and a reduction in the capitalization of software development costs capitalized since the accessanyware release in fiscal net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal was  an increase of  from  in the prior fiscal year 
the increase was primarily the result of the increase to the balance of the line of credit  increased proceeds from the exercise of stock options  and offset by payments made on the capital lease 
streamline health believes that to replicate its existing software would cost significantly more than the stated net book value of  at january  over the last three years  streamline health has spent approximately  in research and development  of which million  or  has been capitalized 
amortization of capitalized software expenditures during the last three years has amounted to approximately  or a net increase in capitalized software of approximately  during the last three years  net of impairment charges of  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
many of the programs related to capitalized software development continue to have significant value to streamline health s current solutions and those under development  as the concepts  ideas  and software code are readily transferable and are incorporated into new products 
as part of the company s strategy  we are intent on increasing the level of recurring subscription revenues from application hosting services 
hosted systems create a cash flow deficiency in the early years of the hosted contract life as significant capital investment is made to implement the system  and cash payments for the service are received over the life of the hosted contract 
as the portfolio of hosted system customers grows  the company may need to obtain additional financing to sustain the inherent deficiency in cash 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain sufficient financing through generation of cash through operations  sale of assets  additional debt or equity financing  or other infusion of capital 
at january   streamline health had cash on hand of  streamline health believes that its present cash position  combined with cash generation currently anticipated from operations  the availability of the revolving credit facility  and possible access to new funding sources will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash requirements for the next twelve months 
however  continued expansion of the company will require additional resources 
the company may need to incur debt  obtain an additional infusion of capital  or a combination of both  depending on the extent of the expansion of the company and future revenues and expenses 
however  there can be no assurance streamline health will be able to do so 
the company is evaluating financing options available to the company 
notwithstanding the current levels of revenues and expenses  for the foreseeable future  streamline health will need to continually assess its revenue prospects compared to its then current expenditure levels 
if it does not appear likely that revenues will increase  it may be necessary to reduce operating expenses or raise cash through additional borrowings  the sale of assets  or other equity financing 
certain of these actions will require current lender approval 
however  there can be no assurance streamline health will be successful in any of these efforts 
if it is necessary to significantly reduce operating expenses  this could have an adverse effect on future operating performance

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its working capital credit facility with fifth third bank 
as of january   the effective interest rate was 
based on borrowings of  as of january   for each percentage point increase in the interest rate  annual interest expense would increase by less than  this analysis uses simplified assumptions such as across the board increases or decreases in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period  and it does not consider the impact of increases or decreases in the outstanding debt  which generally occurs throughout the fiscal year 
therefore  although it gives an indication of the company s exposure to changes in interest rates  it is not intended to predict future results  which may vary significantly 
currently  the company does not have any financial instruments for trading  other speculative purposes or to manage interest rate exposure 
streamline health currently invests its cash balances  in excess of its current needs in an interest bearing  or bank fee reduction based  checking account 
as such  streamline health does not have any significant market risk exposure at january
