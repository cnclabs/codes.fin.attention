item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
item a 
risk factors we may from time to time make written or oral statements that contain forward looking information 
however  our actual results may differ materially from our expectations  statements or projections 
the following risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ from our expectations  statements or projections 
general factors the ongoing crisis in global credit and financial markets could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations 
the ongoing global financial crisis may limit our ability to access the capital markets at a time when we would like  or need  to raise capital  which could have an impact on our ability to react to changing economic and business conditions 
accordingly  if the global financial crisis and current economic downturn continue or worsen  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
we have a history of operating losses and have used increasing amounts of cash for operations and to fund our acquisitions and investments 
we have a history of operating losses  and have used significant amounts of cash to fund our operating activities over the years 
in and  we had operating losses of million and million  respectively 
cash used in continuing operations in and was million and million  respectively 
in addition  we continue to pursue additional acquisitions and investment opportunities and may need to support the financing needs of our subsidiaries 
following our recent capital raise  we currently have enough cash on hand to fund our operations for the next months 
however  we may need additional funds to finance future investment and acquisition activity we wish to undertake 
we do not know if such funds will be available if needed on terms that we consider acceptable 
we may have to limit or adjust our investment acquisition strategy or sell some of our assets in order to continue to pursue our corporate goals 
we depend on key management for the success of our business 
our success is largely dependent on the skills  experience and efforts of our senior management team and other key personnel 
in particular  our success depends on the continued efforts of john a 
moore  our ceo  william j 
mcmahon  ceo of coalogix scr tech  benny sela  ceo of dsit  lindon shiao  ceo of gridsense and jim andersen  ceo of ussi and other key management level employees 
the loss of the services of any of these key employees could materially harm our business  financial condition  future results and cash flow 
we do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our employees other than for our ceo  john a 
moore 
although to date we have been successful in retaining the services of senior management and have entered into employment agreements with them  members of our senior management may terminate their employment agreements without cause and with various notice periods 
we may also not be able to locate or employ on acceptable terms qualified replacements for our senior management or key employees if their services were no longer available 
loss of the services of a few key employees could harm our operations 
we depend on key technical employees and sales personnel 
the loss of certain personnel could diminish our ability to develop and maintain relationships with customers and potential customers 
the loss of certain technical personnel could harm our ability to meet development and implementation schedules 
the loss of key sales personnel could have a negative effect on sales to certain current customers 
most of our significant employees are bound by confidentiality and non competition agreements 
our future success also depends on our continuing ability to identify  hire  train and retain other highly qualified technical and managerial personnel 
if we fail to attract or retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel in the future  our business could be disrupted 
our awards of stock options to employees may not have their intended effect 
a portion of our total compensation program for our executive officers and key personnel has historically included the award of options to buy our common shares or the common stock of our subsidiaries 
if the price of our common stock performs poorly  such performance may adversely affect our ability to retain or attract critical personnel 
in addition  any changes made to our stock option policies  or to any other of our compensation practices  which are made necessary by governmental regulations or competitive pressures could affect our ability to retain and motivate existing personnel and recruit new personnel 
compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance  public disclosure and financial accounting standards may result in additional expenses and affect our reported results of operations 
keeping informed of  and in compliance with  changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance  public disclosure and accounting standards  including the sarbanes oxley act  dodd frank act  as well as new and proposed sec regulations and accounting standards  has required an increased amount of management attention and external resources 
compliance with such requirements may result in increased general and administrative expenses and an increased allocation of management time and attention to compliance activities 
we may not be able to successfully integrate companies which we may invest in or acquire in the future  which could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  future results and cash flow 
we effectively acquired ussi in february  and we closed on our acquisition of gridsense in may any failure to effectively integrate ussi s or gridsense s management into our controls  systems and procedures could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our strategy is to continue to integrate our newly acquired companies and grow the businesses of all of our companies 
integrating acquisitions is often costly  and we may not be able to successfully integrate our acquired companies with our existing operations without substantial costs  delays or other adverse operational or financial consequences 
integrating our acquired companies involves a number of risks that could materially and adversely affect our business  including failure of the acquired companies to achieve the results we expect  inability to retain key personnel of the acquired companies  dilution of existing stockholders  potential disruption of our ongoing business activities and distraction of our management  difficulties in retaining business relationships with suppliers and customers of the acquired companies  difficulties in coordinating and integrating overall business strategies  sales and marketing  and research and development efforts  and the difficulty of establishing and maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  including accounting controls and procedures 
if any of our acquired companies suffers customer dissatisfaction or performance problems  the same could adversely affect the reputation of our group of companies and could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  future results and cash flow 
in order to grow  one or more of our companies may decide to pursue growth through acquisitions 
any significant acquisition by one or more of our operating companies could require substantial use of our capital and may require significant debt or equity financing 
we cannot provide any assurance as to the availability or terms of any such financing or its effect on our liquidity and capital resources 
we incur substantial costs as a result of being a public company 
as a public company  we incur significant legal  accounting  and other expenses in connection with our reporting requirements 
the sarbanes oxley act of  dodd frank act and the rules subsequently implemented by the securities and exchange commission sec and nasdaq  have required changes in corporate governance practices of public companies 
these rules and regulations have already increased our legal and financial compliance costs and the amount of time and effort we devote to compliance activities 
we expect that as a result of continued compliance to these rules and regulations  we will continue to incur significant legal and financial compliance costs 
we continue to regularly monitor and evaluate developments with respect to these new rules with our legal counsel  but we cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs 
we are currently involved in litigation and may in the future become involved in litigation that may materially adversely affect us 
we are currently parties to litigation matters which are described under item legal proceedings 
also  from time to time in the ordinary course of our business  we may become involved in various legal proceedings  including commercial  product liability  employment  class action and other litigation and claims  as well as governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings 
such matters can be time consuming  divert management s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses 
furthermore  because litigation is inherently unpredictable  the results of any such actions may have a material adverse effect on our business  operations or financial condition 
goodwill recorded in connection with our acquisitions is subject to mandatory annual impairment evaluations and as a result  we could be required to write off some or all of this goodwill  which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
in accordance with applicable accounting principles  goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed annually or more frequently for impairment and other intangibles are also reviewed if certain conditions exist 
during the year ended december   we recorded a million impairment of goodwill associated with our former coreworx subsidiary following our decision to stop funding the company and an impairment of million associated with our gridsense segment 
any additional impairment of the value of goodwill will result in an additional charge against earnings which could materially adversely affect our reported results of operations and financial position in future periods 
while we have not reported any material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting in the past  we cannot assure you that material weaknesses will not be identified in the future 
if our internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures are not effective  there may be errors in our financial statements that could require a restatement or our filings may not be timely and investors may lose confidence in our reported financial information 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires us to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each year  and to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in each annual report on form k 
our management  including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer  does not expect that our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud 
a control system  no matter how well designed and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the control system s objectives will be met 
further  the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints  and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs 
controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons  by collusion of two or more people  or by management override of the controls 
over time  controls may become inadequate because changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may occur 
because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 
as a result  we cannot assure you that significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future 
any failure to maintain or implement required new or improved controls  or any difficulties we encounter in their implementation  could result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses  cause us to fail to timely meet our periodic reporting obligations  or result in material misstatements in our financial statements 
any such failure could also adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations regarding disclosure controls and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting required under section of the sarbanes oxley act of and the rules promulgated thereunder 
the existence of a material weakness could result in errors in our financial statements that could result in a restatement of financial statements  cause us to fail to timely meet our reporting obligations and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property  or our intellectual property protection efforts are unsuccessful  others may duplicate our technology 
our operating companies rely on a combination of patents  trademarks  copyrights  trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights 
our ability to compete effectively will depend  in part  on our ability to protect our proprietary technology  systems designs and manufacturing processes 
the ability of others to use our intellectual property could allow them to duplicate the benefits of our products and reduce our competitive advantage 
we do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will be issued or  in the case of patents issued  that the claims allowed are or will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology or processes 
further  a patent issued covering one use of our technology may not be broad enough to cover uses of that technology in other business areas 
even if all our patent applications are issued and are sufficiently broad  they may be challenged or invalidated or our competitors may independently develop or patent technologies or processes that are equivalent or superior to ours 
we could incur substantial costs in prosecuting patent and other intellectual property infringement suits and defending the validity of our patents and other intellectual property 
while we have attempted to safeguard and maintain our property rights  we do not know whether we have been or will be completely successful in doing so 
these actions could place our patents  trademarks and other intellectual property rights at risk and could result in the loss of patent  trademark or other intellectual property rights protection for the products  systems and services on which our business strategy partly depends 
we rely  to a significant degree  on contractual provisions to protect our trade secrets and proprietary knowledge 
these trade secrets cannot be protected by patent protection 
these agreements may be breached  and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach 
our trade secrets may also be known without breach of such agreements or may be independently developed by competitors 
third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property  and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products and services if these claims are successful 
we also may incur significant expenses in affirmatively protecting our intellectual property rights 
in recent years  there has been significant litigation involving patents and other intellectual property rights in many technology related industries and we believe that the industries that certain of our subsidiaries operate have a significant amount of patent activity 
third parties may claim that the technology or intellectual property that we incorporate into or use to develop  manufacture or provide our current and future products  systems or services infringe  induce or contribute to the infringement of their intellectual property rights  and we may be found to infringe  induce or contribute to the infringement of those intellectual property rights and may be required to obtain a license to use those rights 
we may also be required to engage in costly efforts to design our products  systems and services around the intellectual property rights of others 
the intellectual property rights of others may cover some of our technology  products  systems and services 
in addition  the scope and validity of any particular third party patent may be subject to significant uncertainty 
litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming  and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations 
the complexity of the technology involved and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation increase these risks 
claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly royalty or license agreements or to indemnify our customers 
however  we may not be able to obtain royalty or license agreements on terms acceptable to us or at all 
any inability on our part to obtain needed licenses could delay or prevent the development  manufacture and sale of our products  systems or services 
we may also be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development  manufacture and sale of our products  systems or services 
we also may be required to incur significant time and expense in pursuing claims against companies we believe are infringing or have misappropriated our intellectual property rights 
we are currently pursuing one such claim as described under item legal proceedings and may find it necessary to commence such litigation in the future to protect our rights and future business opportunities 
we can offer no assurance as to the outcome of any such litigation 
concentrations of credit risk financial instruments  which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk  consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and trade receivables 
the counterparty to a significant amount of our cash equivalents and restricted cash deposits is a money market of a major financial institution 
we do not believe there is significant risk of non performance by this counterparty 
approximately of the trade accounts receivable at december  was due from three customers that pay their trade receivables over usual credit periods 
credit risk with respect to the balance of trade receivables is generally diversified due to the number of entities comprising our customer base 
risks related to coalogix coalogix has incurred losses since inception and may never achieve sustained profitability 
coalogix has incurred net losses of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we believe that coalogix operating results will improve compared to the results as seen in however  we can provide no assurance that coalogix will generate sufficient revenues to allow it to become profitable or to sustain profitability 
the market for coalogix business is in the early formative stage 
through its subsidiary  scr tech llc  coalogix offers scr catalyst cleaning  rejuvenation and regeneration  as well as scr system management and consulting services 
the size and growth rate for this market will ultimately be determined by a number of factors  including environmental regulations  the growth in the use of scr systems to reduce nox and other pollutants  the length of operation of scr systems  the adoption of regeneration versus replacement  the expansion of warranty coverage from scr catalyst oems  the cost of new scr catalyst  and other factors  most of which are beyond the control of coalogix 
there is limited historical evidence in the united states as to the cycle of replacement  cleaning and regeneration of scr catalyst so as to accurately estimate the potential growth of the business 
in addition  the number of times a catalyst can be regenerated is dependent upon factors which cannot be foreseen such as wear and tear and other mechanical damage to the catalyst 
any delay in the development of the market could significantly and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
coalogix may be subject to vigorous competition with very large competitors that have substantially greater resources and operating histories 
we are aware of one company  evonik energy services  llc  formerly known as steag evonik llc  which entered the us catalyst regeneration market in evonik llc has currently built a regeneration facility in north carolina 
evonik llc  based in kings mountain  north carolina  is a subsidiary of a german power producer  evonik steag gmbh evonik gmbh 
evonik gmbh is very large and has substantially greater resources than coalogix or us 
competition from evonik may have a material adverse effect on our operations  including a potential reduction in operating margins and a loss of potential business 
we are also aware of at least one other company  enerfab  inc that provides scr catalyst management  rejuvenation and cleaning services 
we are aware of certain companies  including babcock hitachi  who have indicated an interest in offering catalyst cleaning and regeneration  and it is possible that manufacturers of new catalyst and other companies may enter the business of scr catalyst regeneration 
there also are a number of scr catalyst manufacturers with substantial parent companies that may seek to maintain market share by significantly reducing prices of new scr catalyst which will put pressure on our operating margins 
these companies include cormetech inc owned by mitsubishi heavy industries and corning  inc  argillon group owned by johnson matthey  ceram  haldor topsoe  inc and babcock hitachi 
further  if the scr catalyst regeneration market expands as we expect  additional competitors could emerge 
in addition  if our intellectual property protection is weakened  competition could more easily develop 
scr tech s lawsuit against evonik energy services llc  et al 
may not be successful  and the counterclaims of evonik energy services llc against scr tech may be successful 
we will incur significant expenses in pursuing our lawsuit against evonik and in defending against evonik s counterclaims 
scr tech s lawsuit against evonik energy services  llc and other defendants as described in item  legal proceedings  is associated with certain significant risks 
the lawsuit will require the time and attention of senior management of scr tech  and could divert attention from other business matters 
expenses of the lawsuit may cause a diversion of significant funds needed by scr tech to fund operations for other aspects of the business 
due to the nature of litigation  it is not possible to predict the outcome of the lawsuit 
we anticipate that the evonik llc defendants will continue vigorously defending themselves  and that evonik llc will vigorously pursue its counterclaims against scr tech 
in the event scr tech is unsuccessful in the lawsuit and evonik llc prevails in its counterclaims  evonik llc may be awarded substantial damages against scr tech 
scr tech has not reserved funds for any loss contingency or legal fees associated with this litigation 
in addition  if scr tech is unsuccessful  evonik llc will remain a competitor of scr tech 
coalogix business is subject to customer concentration 
coalogix offers scr catalyst cleaning  rejuvenation and regeneration  as well as scr system management and consulting services to coal fired power plants 
some of the utilities operating these plants are exceptionally large and operate a number of such power plants 
thus  one or more large utilities could provide a very large order or orders to coalogix which likely would result in one or two such utilities providing most of the orders and revenues for coalogix for a particular quarterly or annual period 
during  four customers represented approximately of coalogix revenue 
during  two customers represented about of coalogix revenue 
during  three customers represented about of coalogix revenue 
although large orders are beneficial to coalogix by providing a large and consistent source of orders and revenues without the additional cost associated with marketing to a larger number of smaller customers  coalogix is dependent on a relatively small number of large utilities for its business 
the loss of one of these customers would have a much greater adverse effect on coalogix than the loss of a smaller customer 
this may also result in significant swings in orders and revenues on a quarterly basis as well as impacting on our cash flows 
coalogix business may be impacted by changes in government regulation and environmental legislation 
our business is significantly dependent on the nature and level of government regulation of emissions 
for instance  the environmental protection agency s epa clean air interstate rule cair was vacated by the district of columbia court of appeals in july  and was subsequently re instated in december by the same court just days before the vacature became effective 
we expect the epa to revise cair or replace it with other clean air regulations  but we cannot at this time predict the nature of such revisions or replacement regulations 
on july   the epa issued the proposed replacement for cair  the transport rule 
the public comment period ended in october   and the epa is in the process of finalizing the proposed regulation 
according to the epa  the transport rule will have the effect of reducing nox from power plants by over levels 
without government regulation of coal fired power generation  scr catalyst would not be used by utilities  there would be no need for utilities to acquire  clean or regenerate scr catalyst  and coalogix would have no business purpose 
further  changes in or adverse interpretations of governmental accounting or rate based emissions regulations also could have a material adverse effect on our business 
although government regulation of emissions has become increasingly stringent in recent years  the growing costs associated with such regulations and the economic downturn in the us may limit the level of increase and scope of emissions requirements  which could limit the potential growth of our target markets 
any easing  delay or deferral of governmental emissions requirements or the growth rate of such requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  the coal industry is subject to regular enactment of new or amended federal  state and local environmental and health and safety statutes  regulations and ballot initiatives  as well as judicial decisions interpreting these requirements 
these requirements may impose substantial capital and operating costs and operational limitations on us and may adversely affect our business 
the requirements may also affect our customers decisions to utilize our services which may materially adversely affect our business 
decreases in demand for electricity resulting from economic  weather changes or other conditions could adversely affect demand for coalogix services and its results of operations 
overall economic activity and the associated demands for power by industrial users can have significant effects on overall electricity demand 
an economic slowdown can significantly slow the growth of electrical demand and could result in utilities using their scr systems less thus extending the life of scr catalyst 
during the current recession demand for electricity has weakened in the us significant declines in the rate of economic growth in the us could materially affect demand for electricity  which may have an adverse effect on demand for coalogix services 
the use of alternative energy sources for power generation could reduce the use of coal by electric utilities in the us  which could result in lower demand for coalogix services and materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations 
although the energy information agency of the us department of energy projects only a gradual decline in use of coal to generate electricity through  the use of coal as a source of power generation in the us could be adversely affected by  among other things the location  availability  quality and price of alternative energy sources for power generation  such as natural gas  fuel oil  nuclear  hydroelectric  wind  biomass and solar power  and technological developments  including those related to alternative energy sources 
gas fueled generation has the potential to displace coal fueled generation  particularly from older  less efficient coal powered generators 
we expect that many of the new power plants needed to meet increasing demand for electricity generation will be fueled by natural gas because gas fired plants are cheaper to construct and permits to construct these plants are easier to obtain as natural gas is seen as having a lower environmental impact than coal fueled generators 
several states have enacted legislative mandates requiring electricity suppliers to use renewable energy sources to generate a certain percentage of power 
there have been numerous proposals to establish a similar uniform  national standard although none of these proposals have been enacted to date 
possible advances in technologies and incentives  such as tax credits  to enhance the economics of renewable energy sources could make these sources more competitive with coal 
any reduction in the amount of coal consumed by domestic electric power generators could reduce the demand for coalogix services  thereby reducing our revenues and materially and adversely affecting our business and results of operations 
coalogix business is subject to potential seasonality 
prior to the january  effective date of phase i of cair  some utilities and ipps operated their scr units only during the ozone season may september 
because of this  coalogix business was more limited than if scr units were required to operate on a continual basis 
during non ozone season periods  most operators had limited if any requirements to run their scr systems 
given that phase i of cair effectively requires operators run their scr systems on a continual basis beginning january   we expect less concentration of coalogix business during the ozone season each year 
however  utilities and ipps may continue to schedule outages and down time for maintenance during periods beyond our control  resulting in seasonality of coalogix business 
these potential fluctuations in revenues and cash flow during a year may be significant and could materially impact our quarterly earnings and cash flow 
this may have a material adverse effect on the perception of our business and the market price for acorn common stock 
coalogix does not own its regeneration facilities  and it is subject to risks inherent in leasing its sites of its operations 
coalogix does not own its two regeneration sites  instead it leases one  the mt 
holly facility  from clariant corporation  the us subsidiary of a switzerland based public company clariant  and the other  the steele creek facility  from fat boy trading company fat boy  an independent owner of the site  for a combined operating space of approximately  square feet 
although we believe the clariant lease terms are favorable  the dependence on clariant and the site for about  square feet of operating space could subject scr tech to increased risk in the event clariant experiences financial setbacks or loses its right to operate the site 
this risk is heightened because the site is a federal superfund site under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of cercla  which increases the risks that the site ultimately could be shut down or that clariant will be financially unable to continue its ownership of the site or uphold its environmental indemnification covenants 
it may be difficult to relocate operations at the clariant facility to another site on a timely or cost effective basis in order to maintain our current combined operating space of  square feet  and coalogix business could be negatively impacted by any problems with continuing to conduct its operations at this site 
coalogix could be subject to environmental risks as a result of the operation of its business and the location of its mt 
holly facility 
the operation of coalogix business and the nature of its assets create various environmental risks 
coalogix leases one of its sites for operations at a property listed on the national priority list as a federal superfund site the mt 
holly facility 
five cercla areas those areas of concern identified under the cercla program are identified on the property  and while coalogix does not lease any property identified as a cercla area  one such cercla area has resulted in contamination of groundwater flowing underneath one of the buildings leased by coalogix 
although coalogix has indemnification from clariant for any environmental liability arising prior to the operation of coalogix business at the site  we can provide no assurance that such indemnification will be sufficient or that coalogix would be protected from an environmental claim from the nature of the site 
in addition  the operation of coalogix business involves removal of hazardous wastes from catalyst and the use of significant chemical materials 
as a result  coalogix could be subject to potential liability resulting from such operations at either facility 
to date  neither acorn nor coalogix has been identified as a potential responsible party to such environmental risks  nor have any amounts been recorded to accrue for these potential exposures 
we will be required to continue to make significant capital expenditures to expand coalogix production facilities or for other purposes  we may require additional capital for such purposes 
we incurred substantial capital expenditures during in order to meet anticipated demand for increased orders for scr regeneration services in and beyond 
the capital expenditures were used to construct a second scr regeneration plant at the steele creek facility 
if the market does not develop as we expect or increased competition results in loss of significant business  we may not generate enough additional revenue from the capital expenditures incurred during this could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position going forward 
moreover  other unanticipated expenses for coalogix such as litigation or other costs for protecting intellectual property rights or as a result of a significant corporate transaction could result in the need for additional capital 
these additional funding requirements may be significant  and funds may not be available when required or may be available only on terms unsatisfactory to us 
our cash requirements will depend on many factors  including but not limited to the market acceptance of our product and service offerings  the ability of coalogix to generate significant cash flow  the rate of expansion of our sales and marketing activities  additional demand for expansion of our production capacity  our ability to manage selling  general and administrative expenditures and the timing and extent of coalogix related research and development projects 
in addition  we continue to actively pursue possible business opportunities  including but not limited to  mergers  acquisitions or other strategic arrangements 
such strategic opportunities could require the use of additional cash  or could require additional equity or debt financing 
the nature and amount of any such financing or the use of any capital in any such transaction cannot be predicted and will depend on the terms and conditions of the particular transaction 
we believe the demand for coalogix services will continue to increase leading to need for expansion in the future 
such expansion may involve expansion of coalogix s  existing facilities or construction of a new facility all requiring additional capital 
there is no assurance that coalogix will be able to obtain such additional capital and if coalogix is not able to do so  coalogix s growth and results of operations will be adversely affected 
certain of coalogix capital equipment is unique to our business and would be difficult and expensive to repair or replace 
certain of the capital equipment used in the services performed by coalogix has been developed and made specifically for us and would be difficult to repair or replace if it were to become damaged or stop working 
in addition  certain of our equipment is not readily available from multiple vendors 
consequently  any damage to or breakdown of our equipment at a time when we are regenerating large amounts of scr catalyst at coalogix may have a material adverse impact on our business 
coalogix is dependent on third parties to perform certain testing required to confirm successful regeneration 
in connection with the regeneration of scr catalyst  coalogix generally must have an independent company provide testing services to determine the level of success of regeneration 
currently there are a limited number of companies providing this service 
if coalogix is unable to obtain this service on a cost effective basis  coalogix may not be able to perform its regeneration services 
in addition  if the testing cannot be completed in a timely manner  there may be a slowdown of operations which can negatively impact the profitability and financial condition of the company 
significant price increases in key materials may reduce coalogix gross margins and profitability of regeneration of scr catalyst 
the prices of various chemicals used to regenerate scr catalyst can be volatile 
if the long term costs of these materials were to increase significantly  we would attempt to reduce material usage or find substitute materials 
if these efforts were not successful or if these cost increases could not be reflected in our price to customers  then our gross margins and profitability of regenerating scr catalyst would be reduced and our ability to operate coalogix profitably could be compromised 
there are risks associated with our purchase of used scr catalyst 
coalogix primary business involves the cleaning and regenerating of customer owned scr catalyst 
in certain instances  however  coalogix may purchase used or spent catalyst from utilities for regeneration  as when  for example  a utility wishes to avoid the costs and potential hazardous waste issues associated with the disposal of used or spent catalyst 
coalogix may purchase scr catalyst for a nominal sum and then regenerate such catalyst for immediate sale  or may purchase spent scr catalyst on an opportunistic basis for future regeneration and sale 
the purchase of spent scr catalyst involves potential risks to coalogix 
for example  spent scr catalyst includes significant hazardous waste  and unlike the regeneration of customer owned scr catalyst  the purchase of spent scr catalyst requires coalogix to take ownership or title to the scr catalyst  which may potentially increase coalogix environmental risk exposure 
furthermore  if coalogix cannot find a customer to purchase the regenerated catalyst  then coalogix must either store the spent catalyst  subject to the inherent risk of holding catalyst which has not been regenerated and contains hazardous waste  or incur significant costs to dispose of the spent catalyst in a manner which complies with the strict requirements of applicable environmental laws 
in addition  the sale of scr catalyst may expose coalogix to risks not inherent in the cleaning and regeneration of scr catalyst  including product liability claims 
it is unclear as to the amount of scr catalyst which coalogix may purchase  but it is possible such purchases ultimately may be substantial  and may significantly increase the risk profile of coalogix business 
many of the risks of our business have only limited insurance coverage and many of our business risks are uninsurable 
our business operations are subject to potential environmental  product liability  employee and other risks 
although we have insurance to cover some of these risks  the amount of this insurance is limited and includes numerous exceptions and limitations to coverage 
further  no insurance is available to cover certain types of risks  such as acts of god  war  terrorism  major economic and business disruptions and similar events 
in the event we were to suffer a significant environmental  product liability  employee or other claim in excess of our insurance or a loss or damages relating to an uninsurable risk  our financial condition could be negatively impacted 
in addition  the cost of our insurance has increased substantially in recent years and may prove to be prohibitively expensive  thus making it impractical to obtain insurance 
this may result in the need to abandon certain business activities or subject ourselves to the risks of uninsured operations 
new technologies could be developed which make scr catalyst obsolete 
coalogix business is dependent upon the needs of coal fired power plants to replace or regenerate scr catalyst 
it is possible that at some point in the future new technology may be developed which replaces scr catalyst as the preferred solution for removing nox from the power plant exhaust 
in such event  coalogix business would be materially and adversely affected 
inability to meet customer guarantees 
coalogix is often required to provide its customers with guarantees for performance of the scr catalyst regenerated by coalogix 
if coalogix is unable to meet customer guarantees  coalogix may have to re perform the affected regeneration job  pay liquidated damages to the customer or both  any of which would have the effect of reducing coalogix profit margin and possibly materially adversely affecting its results of operations 
risks related to dsit solutions failure to accurately forecast costs of fixed priced contracts could reduce our margins 
when working on a fixed price basis  we undertake to deliver software or integrated hardware software solutions to a customer s specifications or requirements for a particular project 
the profits from these projects are primarily determined by our success in correctly estimating and thereafter controlling project costs 
costs may in fact vary substantially as a result of various factors  including underestimating costs  difficulties with new technologies and economic and other changes that may occur during the term of the contract 
if  for any reason  our costs are substantially higher than expected  we may incur losses on fixed price contracts 
hostilities in the middle east region may slow down the israeli high tech market and may harm our israeli operations  our israeli operations may be negatively affected by the obligations of our personnel to perform military service 
our software consulting and development services segment is currently conducted in israel 
accordingly  political  economic and military conditions in israel may directly affect dsit 
any increase in hostilities in the middle east involving israel could weaken the israeli hi tech market  which may result in a significant deterioration of the results of our israeli operations 
in addition  an increase in hostilities in israel could cause serious disruption to our israeli operations if acts associated with such hostilities result in any serious damage to our offices or those of our customers or harm to our personnel 
exchange rate fluctuations could increase the cost of our israeli operations 
a majority of dsit s sales are based on contracts or orders which are in u 
s dollars or are in new israeli shekels nis linked to the us dollar 
at the same time  most of dsit s expenses are denominated in nis primarily labor costs and are not linked to any foreign currency 
while the dollar value of the revenues of our operations in israel will increase if the dollar is devalued in relation to the nis  the net effect of such devaluation is that dsit s costs in dollar terms increase more than our revenues 
in the nis strengthened in relation to the us dollar by 
dsit enters into forward contracts to try to mitigate its exposures to exchange rate fluctuations  however  we can provide no assurance that such controls will be implemented successfully 
we are substantially dependent on a small number of customers and the loss of one or more of these customers may cause revenues and cash flow to decline 
in  of dsit s revenues were concentrated in three customers 
these customers are expected to continue to make up a significant portion of dsit s revenues and cash flow for a significant reduction of future orders or delay in milestone payments from any of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the performance of dsit 
we are dependent on meeting milestones to provide cash flow for operations 
our present operations  as we are currently structured  place a great reliance on our meeting project milestones in order to generate cash flow to finance our operations 
should we encounter difficulties in meeting significant project milestones  resulting cash flow difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we must at times provide significant guarantees in order to secure projects 
these guarantees are often collateralized by restricted deposits 
some of the projects we perform require significant performance and or bank guarantees 
at december   dsit has million of performance and bank guarantees outstanding 
in addition  dsit has on deposit at two israeli banks approximately million collateralizing some of these guarantees 
these deposits are restricted and  accordingly  dsit cannot use these funds for operations until the guarantees which are being collateralized are released 
at times  this can create cash flow difficulties which could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
in addition  dsit may not always be able to supply such guarantees without financial assistance from acorn 
if acorn needs to provide financial guarantees for dsit  acorn may not have sufficient funds available to it to invest in other emerging ventures or take advantage of opportunities available to us in a timely manner 
at december   acorn had on deposit million of restricted cash at two israeli banks collateralizing dsit guarantees 
if we are unable to keep pace with rapid technological change  our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows may suffer 
some of our solutions are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and industry standards and technological obsolescence 
our competitiveness and future success depends on our ability to keep pace with changing technologies and industry standards on a timely and cost effective basis 
a fundamental shift in technologies could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position 
our failure to react to changes in existing technologies could materially delay our development of new products  which could result in technological obsolescence  decreased revenues  and or a loss of market share to competitors 
to the extent that we fail to keep pace with technological change  our revenues and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
we are dependent on a number of suppliers who provide us with components for some of our products 
a number of our suppliers provide us with major components for some of our products for our energy security sonar solutions 
some of these components are long lead items 
if for some reason  the suppliers cannot provide us with the component when we need it and we cannot easily find substitute suppliers on similar terms  we may have increased costs and or delays in delivering a product to a customer and incur penalties and lose customer confidence 
in addition  project delays can also slow down revenue recognition and our financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
while we are constantly attempting to develop secondary and tertiary suppliers for these components  we can provide no assurance that we will be successful in doing so on terms acceptable to us 
we are a relatively small company with limited resources compared to some of our current and potential competitors  which may hinder our ability to compete effectively 
some of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater resources and broader name recognition than we have 
as a result  these competitors may have greater credibility with our existing and potential customers 
they also may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than we can to ours  which would allow them to respond more quickly than us to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements 
risks related to gridsense gridsense has incurred net losses and may never achieve sustained profitability 
gridsense has incurred net losses for the years ended december  and we believe that gridsense will reduce its losses in  however  we can provide no assurance that gridsense will generate sufficient revenues and cash flow to allow it to become profitable or to sustain profitability or to have positive cash flows 
gridsense will need additional financing to grow and finance its operations gridsense will continue to require additional working capital support in order to finance its operations in this support may be in the form of a bank line  new investment by others  additional investment by acorn  or a combination of the above 
since january   acorn has lent gridsense  we have no assurance that such additional support will be available in sufficient amounts  in a timely manner and on acceptable terms 
the availability and amount of any additional investment from acorn may be limited by the working capital needs of our corporate activities and other operating companies gridsense s products and services may not gain market acceptance or competitors may introduce offerings that surpass those of gridsense 
the primary market for gridsense s products and services is rapidly evolving which means that the level of acceptance of products and services that have been released recently or that are planned for future release by the marketplace is not certain 
if the markets for gridsense s products and services fail to develop  develop more slowly than expected or become subject to intense competition  its business will suffer 
as a result  gridsense may be unable to i successfully market its current products and services  ii develop new products  services and enhancements to current products and services  iii complete customer installations on a timely basis or iv complete products and services currently under development 
if gridsense s products and services are not accepted by its customers or by other businesses in the marketplace  gridsense s business and operating results will be materially affected 
in addition  we can provide no assurance that gridsense will be successful in deriving significant revenue growth through its current strategy and marketing initiatives 
gridsense s products are subject to regulatory approvals 
numerous regulations govern the manufacture and sale of gridsense s products in the united states and other countries where gridsense intends to market its products 
such regulation bears upon the approval of manufacturing techniques  testing procedures and approval for the manufacturing and sale of gridsense s products  including advertising and labeling 
any failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approvals would adversely affect our ability to market our products 
furthermore  product approvals may be withdrawn if problems occur following initial marketing or if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained 
the failure  delay or withdrawal of a previously given regulatory approval could materially adversely affect our revenues  cash flows and financial position 
sales to utilities are generally characterized by long sales cycles 
gridsense s sales are largely dependent on the sales cycle of electric utilities which is typically long and requires much technical and application support 
the purchasing cycle for a utility may involve an evaluation trial or pilot  analysis of data and results  review of competitor s offerings and smaller scale deployments  before a purchasing decision is made 
for large orders  some utilities are required to solicit competitive bids from other vendors which can contribute more time 
the entire process can take anywhere between several weeks to several quarters 
delays in securing purchase orders can materially adversely affect our revenues  cash flows and financial condition 
gridsense is attempting to broaden its revenue base by expanding into the north american market 
gridsense is currently generating a large portion of its revenue from sales in australia more than for the calendar year 
gridsense believes that its continued growth and profitability will require additional expansion of sales in other markets  most notably the north american market 
to the extent that gridsense is unable to expand sales into other markets in a timely and cost effective manner  its business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  even with the successful recruitment of additional personnel and international resellers  there can be no assurance that gridsense will be successful in maintaining or increasing international market demand for its products 
exchange rate fluctuations could increase the cost of gridsense s australian operations 
gridsense has operations in both the us and australia 
its australian operations are subject to the volatility of the australian dollar vis vis the us dollar in the australian dollar strengthened in relation to the us dollar by 
while risks are somewhat mitigated by the fact that gridsense s australian operation s sales and expenses are primarily denominated in australian dollars  currency fluctuations may impact the translation of certain balance sheet items  affect the economics of manufacturing and ultimately affect its financial performance 
gridsense s market is subject to rapidly changing technologies 
gridsense s markets its products in a field where electronics and software firmware dominate 
this fast changing area may generate unknown methods of detecting and monitoring disturbances that could render gridsense s technology inferior  resulting in gridsense s results of operations being materially adversely affected 
gridsense does  however  closely monitor trends and changes in technologies and customer demand that could adversely impact its competitiveness and overall success 
gridsense is subject to vigorous competition with very large competitors that have substantially greater resources and operating histories 
some of gridsense s competitors in the markets it serves are larger  better capitalized and have greater resources than gridsense 
as gridsense grows and penetrates markets where larger companies have been established  it may experience a reduced rate of growth due to competitive forces 
competition from these competitors may have a material adverse effect on our operations  including a potential reduction in operating margins and a loss of potential business 
risks related to ussi ussi is a development stage company with a limited operating history 
ussi was formed in november and has a limited operating history 
many of its products are at a research and development stage and substantial time  effort and financial resources may be required before we will be profitable 
ussi s operations are subject to all of the risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise  especially one that is dependent on developing new products for the oil gas and security industries 
the likelihood of ussi s success should be considered in light of the problems  expenses  difficulties  complications and delays frequently encountered in connection with establishing a new business such as uncertainty in product development  uncertainty in market acceptance of the its products  competition  and changes in business strategy 
ussi has no assurance that it will be successful in its business activities 
history of operating losses  anticipated losses since its inception  ussi has had annual operating losses 
ussi expects to continue to have operating losses for year ended december  and possibly beyond as a result of increases in operating expenses required to commence manufacturing and to expand its sales and marketing operations 
ussi can provide no assurance that it will ultimately generate sufficient revenues to allow it to become profitable  to sustain profitability or to have positive cash flows 
ussi will need additional financing to grow its business and finance its operations in the period since acorn s initial investment in november through february   it has invested million in ussi 
in addition  acorn has an option to invest an additional million in ussi by may ussi has no assurance that acorn will exercise this option 
ussi also has no assurance that even if acorn does exercise all of these options  that ussi s future capital needs will not exceed these amounts or that ussi will generate sufficient cash flow to fund its operations in the absence of additional funding sources 
ussi will likely need to raise additional funds if revenues fail to meet projections or to fund a rapid expansion to meet product demand  respond to competitive pressures or acquire complementary products  businesses or technologies 
if additional funds are raised through the direct issuance of equity or convertible debt securities to third parties  acorn s percentage ownership of ussi may be reduced 
in addition  should additional funds be needed  there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to ussi 
if funds are not available  or are not available on acceptable terms  ussi may not be able to fund its growth  respond to competitive pressures or take advantage of unanticipated acquisition opportunities 
accordingly  this could materially and adversely affect ussi s business  results of operations and financial condition 
ussi is a small company with limited resources compared to some of its current and potential competitors  which may hinder its ability to compete effectively 
some of ussi s current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater resources and broader name recognition than does ussi 
as a result  these competitors may have greater credibility with ussi s existing and potential customers 
they also may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than can ussi to its products  which would allow them to respond more quickly than ussi to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements 
if ussi is unable to keep pace with technological change  ussi s results of operations  financial condition and cash flows may suffer 
many of ussi s products are in the research and development stage 
in addition  some of ussi s existing products may require additional engineering and upgrades in conjunction with market developments as well as specific customer needs 
there can be no assurance that ussi will continue to be successful in its engineering efforts regarding the development of its products and future technological difficulties could adversely affect its business  results of operations and financial condition 
ussi is not yet ready to manufacture its products in commercial quantities 
in order to be successful  ussi s products must be manufactured in commercial quantities at an acceptable cost and must meet the specifications required by the customers regarding quality 
ussi s space and manufacturing capabilities at its current facilities in northridge  california are not expected to be sufficient to handle the anticipated increase in sales for the near future 
should ussi require additional manufacturing capacity  there can be no assurance it will be able to increase the size and quality of its manufacturing processes fast enough to meet demand 
any material delays by ussi or any unanticipated manufacturing difficulties could materially and adversely affect its business  results of operations and financial condition 
ussi is dependent on a number of suppliers who provide it with key components for some of its products 
ussi s products incorporate state of the art technologies 
as such  in many cases there are limited supplies of key components 
in particular  ussi currently relies on a single source for the development of its high end interrogators for some of its technologically advanced product offerings 
ussi has not yet found a second source supplier that is economically feasible to use at this time 
while ussi continues to try to mitigate the risks associated with this key component  any production delays by this supplier or any adverse change to its financial condition could materially and adversely affect ussi s business  results of operations and financial condition 
ussi s targeted customers may be reluctant to try its alternative solution despite its increased reliability and lower cost 
potential customers may elect to continue to use the existing expensive and less reliable technologies given their familiarity of the existing products in the market plane 
the competition in ussi s markets may have superior resources and marketing ability which could lead to potential customers selecting existing products over ussi s products 
while ussi continues to develop its products and invest in marketing efforts accordingly  there is no assurance that ussi s products will be preferred in the market place relative to the competition with superior overall resources 
if the market place does not adopt ussi s products as anticipated  ussi s business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
failure to accurately forecast costs of fixed priced contracts could reduce ussi s margins 
when working on a fixed price basis  ussi undertakes to deliver solutions to a customer s specifications or requirements for a particular project 
the profits from these projects are primarily determined by ussi s success in correctly estimating and thereafter controlling project costs 
costs may in fact vary substantially as a result of various factors  including underestimating costs  difficulties with new technologies and economic and other changes that may occur during the term of the contract 
if  for any reason  ussi s costs are substantially higher than expected  ussi may incur losses on fixed price contracts 
ussi may lose sales if it is unable to obtain government authorization to export its products 
the export of some of ussi s products may be subject to export controls imposed by the us government and administered by the us departments of state and commerce 
in certain instances  these regulations may require pre shipment authorization from the administering department 
for products subject to the export administration regulations ear administered by the department of commerce s bureau of industry and security  the requirement for a license is dependent on the type and end use of the product  the final destination and the identity of the end user 
all ussi products that are exported are subject to ear  however  most of ussi s equipment is considered ear ear items generally consist of low technology consumer goods and do not require a license in many situations 
however  if ussi were to attempt to export an ear item to an embargoed country  to an end user of concern as defined by the us department of commerce or in support of a prohibited end use as defined by the us department of commerce  ussi would be required to obtain a license 
exports of certain ussi products may also be subject to the international traffic in arms regulations itar regulations administered by the department of state s directorate of defense trade controls require a license 
obtaining export licenses can be difficult and time consuming 
failure to obtain export licenses could significantly reduce our revenue and materially adversely affect ussi s business  financial condition and results of operations 
compliance with us government regulations may also subject ussi to additional fees and costs 
the absence of comparable restrictions on competitors in other countries may adversely affect ussi s competitive position 
limited protection of proprietary technology  risks of infringement ussi s success is heavily dependent upon its internally developed technology 
ussi has filed patents covering the specific use and novel inventions developed internally 
to further protect its proprietary rights  ussi relies on a combination of patent  trade secret  nondisclosure and other contractual restrictions 
as part of its confidentiality procedures  ussi enters into nondisclosure agreements with its employees  consultants and strategic partners and limit access to and distribution of its designs and proprietary information 
despite these efforts  ussi may be unable to effectively protect its proprietary rights 
in addition  the expense associated with the enforcement of ussi s proprietary rights may be substantial 
risks related to our securities our stock price is highly volatile 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially in the past and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations 
since january  our common stock has traded at prices as low as and as high as per share 
fluctuations in our stock price may continue to occur in response to various factors  many of which we cannot control  including general economic and political conditions and specific conditions in the markets we address  including the continued volatility in the energy industry and the general economy  quarter to quarter variations in our operating results  announcements of changes in our senior management  the gain or loss of one or more significant customers or suppliers  announcements of technological innovations or new products by our competitors  customers or us  the gain or loss of market share in any of our markets  changes in accounting rules  changes in investor perceptions  or changes in expectations relating to our products  plans and strategic position or those of our competitors or customers 
in addition  the market prices of securities of energy related companies have been and remain volatile 
this volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
our share price may decline due to the large number of shares of our common stock eligible for future sale in the public market including shares underlying warrants and options 
almost all of our outstanding shares of common stock are  or could upon exercise of options or warrants would become  eligible for sale in the public market as described below 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market  or the possibility of these sales  may adversely affect our stock price

the hartensteins  evonik llc and the german defendants are collectively referred to as the evonik defendants 
on february   the evonik defendants filed motions for summary judgment on the nonexistence of scr tech s trade secrets or confidential information  statutes of limitation  release and lack of standing and motion requesting that the court stay discovery 
scr tech filed responses to these motions 
the court  after hearing argument on these motions  issued its order dated july  denying the evonik defendants motions for summary judgment on statutes of limitation  release and lack of standing  and with respect to the motion for summary judgment on non existence of trade secrets or confidential information the court held such motion in abeyance pending completion of limited discovery as directed by the court 
such limited discovery has concluded  the parties have filed briefs with the court and are awaiting the court s decision regarding the pending motion for summary judgment 
in the answers filed by the evonik defendants  the evonik defendants have asserted counterclaims against scr tech with unspecified amounts of damages 
coalogix believes that such counterclaims are without merit  and that any award of any material amount with respect to such counterclaims is remote

overview and trend information the following discussion includes statements that are forward looking in nature

certain of these factors are discussed in item a 
risk factors 
we operate in four reportable segments coalogix  energy security sonar solutions through our dsit subsidiary  gridsense and ussi 
the following analysis should be read together with the segment information provided in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
coalogix in april  we entered into an agreement with coalogix  enertech and certain members of coalogix senior management pursuant to which acorn and enertech each agreed to invest million  and certain members of coalogix senior management agreed to invest an aggregate of approximately  in coalogix 
through september   coalogix received the entire million including the million from acorn investment commitment from acorn  enertech and coalogix senior management  including million invested million by acorn in proceeds of the investment were used by coalogix primarily for development of coalogix new steele creek facility  technology development  legal expenses and computer software 
in august  coalogix completed the building of its steele creek facility and began operations at that site 
the opening of the steele creek facility approximately doubled coalogix throughput capacity 
this expansion enabled scr tech to meet the growing demands of the catalyst and catalyst regeneration markets 
coalogix revenues in were approximately million compared to revenues of million 
the increase in coalogix revenues in compared to is due to increased penetration in the growing regeneration market combined with the increased throughput capacity provided by coalogix new steele creek facility 
coalogix revenues in the fourth quarter of of million represents an increase over fourth quarter revenues of million and a increase over third quarter revenues of million 
the year on year increase in revenues was attributable largely to increased production volume facilitated by improved production efficiency and the plant expansion 
the increase from third quarter revenues was due primarily to the plant expansion 
during  coalogix replaced and increased its inventory of scr modules available for sale based on customer demands from million to million 
coalogix gross profit in was million compared to gross profit of million 
the increase in coalogix gross profit in was attributable to the increase in revenues 
gross margins decreased from in to in  primarily due to the negative impact of startup activities and related increased resources associated with the opening of the steele creek facility in late we expect gross margins to increase in as the steele creek facility becomes fully optimized 
coalogix gross profit in the fourth quarter of was million representing a million or increase over the gross profit of million recorded by coalogix in the fourth quarter of coalogix gross profit in the fourth quarter of also represented a million increase in gross profit compared to the third quarter of the increase in coalogix fourth quarter gross profit for over was attributable to higher sales volume which more than compensated for the decrease in gross margin from to 
the decrease in the gross margin in the fourth quarter of as compared to the fourth quarter of was due to a higher cost base from operating two operating facilities starting in august 
the gross margin is expected to improve over time as the new facility becomes fully optimized 
the increase in coalogix fourth quarter gross profit compared to the third quarter of was attributable to the increase in sales million combined with third quarter gross profit being negatively impacted by startup activities and related increased resources associated with the opening of the steele creek facility during the third quarter of during  coalogix recorded approximately million of selling  general and administrative sg a expense as compared to approximately million recorded during the increase in coalogix sg a expense is attributable to increased overhead costs resulting from the company s growth  which includes new staff hires and expenses associated with the steele creek facility prior to commencement of the august start up 
on july   the subsidiaries of coalogix executed an amendment of its credit facility which extended and increased its credit availability to a million formula based line of credit  a million non formula based line of credit and million non formula based letter of credit 
the credit facility expires june  and carries an interest rate of the greater of above prime rate or on the formula line of credit and the greater of above prime rate or on the non formula line of credit 
the maximum amount of outstanding credit under the facility is million 
coalogix backlog at december  was approximately million 
we expect to recognize in income approximately million of that amount in in  we expect coalogix to continue to increase its revenues as it continues to penetrate the local us regeneration market and as we continue to expand capacity and efficiency at our steele creek plant 
however  we expect that first quarter revenues will be below fourth quarter and may be lower than first quarter revenues due to seasonal budgeting and lower demand for electricity by industrial customers during the economic downturn and the subsequent postponement of catalyst replacement 
the level of our revenues may also be impacted by our revenue recognition policy as we do not recognize revenue until we have receipt of satisfactory third party test results on the regeneration of modules 
the lease at our mt 
holly facility expires in june while we have an option to continue to operate at this site  we are evaluating other options such as expanding production at the steele creek facility and construction of an additional production facility 
our profitability will continue to be impacted by professional fees for our lawsuit against evonik see item legal proceedings  costs associated with our possible entry into the chinese and other regeneration markets and costs for certain research and development initiatives to maintain our technological edge 
dsit solutions in  dsit continued to focus on marketing and developing its energy and security sonar solutions and products  particularly its products related to underwater security for energy and other strategic sites 
revenue of our dsit subsidiary increased by million  or  from million in to million in the increase was due to increased revenue in the energy security sonar solutions segment while other revenue representing certain it and consulting work performed by dsit remained stable 
fourth quarter revenue for dsit was million reflecting a slight increase over fourth quarter revenue of million 
fourth quarter revenues million were below third quarter revenues million due to the winding down of certain aquashieldtm projects combined with a decrease in revenue recognized on certain projects as well as a delay in the receipt of an anticipated follow up expansion order of our aquashieldtm systems 
gross profit in dsit in was million which reflects an increase of million or from million in dsit s gross profit of million during the fourth quarter of represented a million decrease over dsit s gross profit in the fourth quarter of the increase in the year on year gross profit was attributable to the increased revenues  particularly in dsit s energy sonar security projects 
the decrease in dsit s quarter on quarter gross profit was due to primarily to decreased margins in dsit s non energy and sonar solutions projects caused by unanticipated delays in completing certain projects 
fourth quarter gross profit was also million below third quarter gross profit million due to decreased sales and reduced gross margins 
dsit gross margin in was  down slightly from s gross margin of 
this followed an increase in its gross margin from in fourth quarter gross margin was as compared to in the fourth quarter of and in the third quarter of the decrease in gross margins in the fourth quarter of was primarily due to reduced margins in certain projects which encountered technological difficulties which caused greater than expected labor costs to bring the projects to completion 
during  dsit recorded approximately million of sg a expense as compared to approximately million recorded during the increase in dsit sg a expense is attributable to increased marketing costs as well as increased salary costs primarily one time charges 
dsit recorded net income of million in million in and million in 
decreased net income in as compared to is due to benefiting from an income tax benefit of approximately  while incurred a tax expense of approximately  dsit s backlog at december  was approximately million of which it expects to recognize approximately million in dsit expects to continue to show revenue growth in and expects to be profitable as well at a level at least equal to this  however  is dependent upon the receipt of an anticipated follow up order from an existing customer in the first quarter of if this follow up order is received later than expected  while we still expect to be profitable  we cannot at this time determine at what level of profitability we expect to complete the year 
if this follow up order is not received we may have to take certain cost cutting measures in order to maintain profitability 
energy security sonar solutions during and  revenues from our energy security sonar solutions segment in our dsit subsidiary were million and million  respectively  accounting for approximately and of dsit s revenues for and  respectively 
the balance of dsit s revenues of million and million for the years ending december  and were derived from dsit s other it and consulting activities 
this segment s revenues increased by million or in as compared to this followed an increase of million or in as compared to the increase in sales was the result of revenue recorded from the sale of dsit aquashield dds systems to an undisclosed emea customer as well as a slight increase million in revenues recorded in other real time and embedded hardware and software projects 
segment gross profit continued to increase from million in to million in 
the increased gross profit in as compared to was due to increased sales of our energy and sonar solutions products 
segment gross margins decreased slightly from in to in we anticipate continued growth in sales in  particularly from our acoustic and sonar solutions projects with our embedded hardware and software development projects expected to remain relatively stable 
we anticipate new customers from new regions primarily asia based placing orders for our sonar and acoustic products in gridsense in  gridsense continued its focus on delivering solutions that address the power quality and reliability needs of utilities 
each of gridsense s main product lines the line iqtm  powermonictm and transformer iqtm addresses different aspects of the power delivery system 
in addition to its existing product range  gridsense continues to invest in new technology which may lead to the commercialization of new products and revenue drivers for the business 
one of such investment was the acquisition of omi inc in may  which complemented gridsense s transformer iqtm product family with a proprietary technology for monitoring bushings 
in  full year revenues were million compared to million in the decline of million or from to was due to a number of factors including weak global market conditions which affected the utility spending in most markets 
in  full year gross profit was million compared to million in the decline is million or from to the gross margin percentage remained unchanged at in both and such gross profit and gross margin for excludes amortization expense of intangible assets of million which is included in cost of sales in following acorn s full consolidation beginning in may in  gridsense s us operations contributed million to the gridsense s total revenue  virtually unchanged from the lack of growth is attributed to weakness in utility spending as well as disruptions to the us sales organization during the year 
the australia operations contributed million in compared to million in  a slight decrease of million or 
the decrease is attributable to a reduction of bulk orders from major utilities in australia which was partially offset by the strengthened australian dollar which increased revenues denominated in australian dollars to us dollars 
gridsense s full year revenues by main product lines for and are as follows in thousands of u 
s dollars powermonictm line iqtm transformer iqtm other total sales across all product lines declined in compared to management expects sales for all product lines to resume growth as market conditions improve 
in line iqtm sales represented of gridsense s revenues 
in  transformer iqtm sales represented of overall company sales 
management expects sales from both the line iqtm and transformer iqtm to represent a greater portion of overall sales in the future 
these product lines are expected to drive sales growth for the company 
the line iqtm product family will be introducing a newly redesigned advanced sensor which improves both the functionality and price of its predecessor product 
management expects increases in the size of deployment with existing line iqtm users as well as adoption by new utility customers 
the transformer iqtm was recently commercially introduced and the market was seeded with this product during ongoing deployments and customer evaluations are going smoothly and management expects these installations to expand in size 
management also expects growth from new customers as marketing and sales efforts expand to the broad market 
ussi in  ussi continued to focus on customer proof of concept contracts for its major product lines 
in particular  ussi had contract revenue related to d reservoir shale gas monitoring  commercial revenue from fiber optic perimeter security systems  and government contract revenue from fiber optic underwater security system development for diver detection 
full year revenue for ussi increased modestly from to the increase in was primarily from contractual revenue in the d reservoir shale gas monitoring system development 
we anticipate significant growth in revenues in  particularly from our fiber optic perimeter security systems as we commence with the installation of our recently received latin america contract with pcsc  a global security solutions provider based in torrance  ca 
in addition  we anticipate new customers in related to our d reservoir shale gas monitoring systems as a result of the numerous demonstrations scheduled in as well as continued progress on ussi s existing contracts 
coreworx in december  following a decision by the acorn s board of directors to cease providing funding for coreworx  we entered into an agreement the agreement with coreworx to sell all of our common stock in coreworx to a management buyout group consisting of coreworx management and certain employees and other investors 
we have not attributed any value to the any of the instruments noted below 
under the terms of the agreement i 
coreworx remaining indebtedness owed to us of approximately million was reduced to million by our exchanging all of our shares of common stock of coreworx for of the newly issued and outstanding shares of common stock of coreworx with such shares received by us being non voting shares new coreworx shares  ii 
we received at closing a warrant to acquire  shares of common stock of coreworx for c us per share for years from the closing date  dec 
 the warrant represents of coreworx current common stock outstanding 
iii 
the debt of million owed by coreworx to us the coreworx debt is non interest bearing  and the first payment is due january  iv 
the coreworx debt is to be repaid in an amount equal to of coreworx gross revenues commencing at the date of closing  and payments for the period commencing on the closing date through december  are to be paid in equal monthly installments starting on january  and on the last day of each of the following months 
v 
the payments of the coreworx debt for revenue periods subsequent to coreworx fiscal year will be payable on a quarterly basis within days following the end of coreworx fiscal quarter end periods 
vi 
following repayment of the coreworx debt  coreworx is to pay us a royalty fee the royalty equal to of coreworx gross revenues up to a maximum amount of million 
vii 
the royalty shall be paid on a quarterly basis within days following the end of coreworx fiscal quarter end periods 
viii 
coreworx is to pay us a restructuring fee of  on or before july repayment of the coreworx debt is secured by a security interest in coreworx intellectual property on a pari passu basis with the other holders of coreworx common stock following closing which necessitated us releasing at closing our prior security interest in coreworx other personal property and intangibles 
in connection with the sale of our shares of common stock of coreworx  we recorded a gain of approximately million as a result of the disposition of coreworx 
the gain on the deconsolidation of coreworx is comprised of the following a gain of million on the deconsolidation of coreworx assets and liabilities 
a full provision on the coreworx debt of million due us from coreworx following the mbo transaction as there is significant doubt as to coreworx ability to repay the debt 
an estimated million of legal fees 
in addition  coreworx had losses of million and million for the year ended december  and for the period from january  to december  respectively 
the loss for includes the impairment of the goodwill and intangibles of million that were recorded as at october  following the company s decision to stop funding coreworx and is reflected as loss from discontinued operations in the company s consolidated statements of income 
we have not attributed any value to the holdings retained by us following the sale of our stake in coreworx on december   the warrants to acquire an additional of coreworx  the million of coreworx debt or the  restructuring fee due from coreworx on july  corporate corporate general and administrative expense in reflected a million increase to million as compared to million of expense in the increase in corporate general and administrative expense in is due primarily to bonuses recorded in the first quarter of combined with increased professional fees primarily associated with an sec inquiry regarding our sales of comverge stock  registered direct offering and our acquisitions  increased investor relations costs and corporate personnel 
fourth quarter corporate general and administrative expense of million reflected a million decrease as compared to the third quarter corporate general and administrative expense 
we expect our annual corporate general and administrative costs to decrease in as compared to as we begin to benefit from our cost cutting measures taken in the fourth quarter 
such measures included personnel reductions and reducing investor relation costs 
critical accounting policies the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
the following discussion of critical accounting policies represents our attempt to report on those accounting policies  which we believe are critical to our consolidated financial statements and other financial disclosure 
it is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our significant accounting policies  which are more fully described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which the selection of an available alternative policy would not produce a materially different result 
we have identified the following as critical accounting policies affecting our company principles of consolidation and investments in associated companies  business combinations  impairments in goodwill and intangible assets  revenue recognition  foreign currency transactions and stock based compensation 
principles of consolidation and investments in associated companies our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all majority owned subsidiaries 
all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated 
investments in other entities are accounted for using the equity method or cost basis depending upon the level of ownership and or our ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee 
investments of this nature are recorded at original cost and adjusted periodically to recognize our proportionate share of the investee s net income or losses after the date of investment 
when net losses from an investment accounted for under the equity method exceed its carrying amount  the investment balance is reduced to zero and additional losses are not recorded 
we resume accounting for the investment under the equity method when the entity subsequently reports net income and our share of that net income exceeds the share of net losses not recognized during the period the equity method was suspended 
investments are written down only when there is clear evidence that a decline in value that is other than temporary has occurred 
in the year ending december   we began consolidating the results of ussi effective february  following the signing of option agreements with ussi and certain shareholders of ussi whereby we received options to acquire up to of the company see note b to our consolidated financial statements 
we also began consolidating the results of gridsense on may following our acquisition of the approximately of the company we did not previously own 
on december   we ceased consolidating the results of coreworx following the sale of all of our common stock in the company to a management buyout group consisting of coreworx management and certain employees and other investors 
the results of coreworx are presented as discontinued operations for all the periods since our acquisition of them in august business combination accounting we have acquired a number of businesses during the last several years  and we may acquire additional businesses in the future 
business combination accounting  often referred to as purchase accounting  requires us to determine the fair value of all assets acquired  including identifiable intangible assets  and liabilities assumed 
the cost of the acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in amounts equal to the estimated fair value of each asset and liability  and any remaining acquisition cost is classified as an amortizable intangible asset  a non amortizable intangible asset or goodwill 
this allocation process requires extensive use of estimates and assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows to be generated by the acquired assets 
certain identifiable intangible assets  such as customer lists and covenants not to compete  are amortized based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed over the intangible asset s estimated useful life 
the estimated useful life of our amortizable identifiable intangible assets ranges from three to twenty years 
goodwill is not amortized 
accordingly  the acquisition cost allocation has had  and will continue to have  a significant impact on our current operating results 
goodwill and intangibles as a result of our various acquisitions  we have recorded goodwill and various amortizable intangible assets 
businesses acquired are recorded at their fair value on the date of acquisition 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill 
we also sometimes acquire specific intangibles such as our acquisition in of a license agreement 
our goodwill at december  was approximately million representing approximately of our total assets 
our goodwill is allocated to our segments as follows coalogix approximately million  energy security sonar solutions approximately million  gridsense approximately million and ussi approximately million 
our intangible assets that have finite useful lives recorded at fair value at the time of the acquisition  and are carried at such value less accumulated amortization 
our net intangible asset balance at december  was approximately million representing approximately of our total assets 
the composition of our intangible assets at december  consisted of scr technologies in our coalogix segment million  net of accumulated amortization  naval technologies in our energy security sonar solutions segment million  net of accumulated amortization  software and customer relationships in our gridsense segment million  net of accumulated amortization and sensor technologies in our ussi segment million  net of accumulated amortization 
we amortize these intangible assets on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
we review our goodwill for impairment annually at the reporting unit level in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
each of our reportable operating segments coalogix  energy security sonar solutions  gridsense and ussi is deemed to be a reporting unit 
these reporting units have been identified based on appropriate accounting principles  which considers  among other things  the manner in which we operate our business and the availability of discrete financial information 
assets acquired and liabilities assumed are assigned to a reporting unit as of the date of acquisition 
in the event we reorganize our business  we reassign the assets including goodwill and liabilities among the affected reporting units 
our corporate activities and those relating to our non reporting segment are not assigned to our reporting units 
we periodically review these reporting units to ensure that they continue to reflect the manner in which the business is operated 
we also analyze whether any indicators of impairment for goodwill and intangibles exist each quarter 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred 
such indicators may include a sustained  significant decline in our share price and market capitalization  a decline in our expected future cash flows  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  unanticipated competition  the testing for recoverability of our long lived assets  and or slower growth rates  among others 
the first step of our annual evaluation is to compare the estimated fair value of our reporting units to their respective carrying values to determine whether there is an indicator of potential impairment 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value  we conduct a second step  in which we calculate the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the calculated implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets such as the assembled workforce as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination at the date of assessment and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using discounted expected future cash flows 
we performed a valuation analysis  utilizing an income approach in our goodwill assessment process 
the following describes the valuation methodology used to derive the fair value of our reporting units 
income approach to determine each reporting unit s estimated fair value  we discount the expected cash flows of our reporting units 
we estimate our future cash flows after considering current economic conditions and trends  estimated future operating results  growth rates  anticipated future economic and regulatory conditions  and the availability of necessary technology 
the discount rate used represents the estimated weighted average cost of capital  which reflects the overall level of inherent risk involved in our operations and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn 
to estimate cash flows beyond the final year of our model  we use a terminal value approach 
under this approach  we use estimated operating income before depreciation and amortization in the final year of our model  adjust it to estimate a normalized cash flow  apply a perpetuity growth assumption and discount by a perpetuity discount factor to determine the terminal value 
we incorporate the present value of the resulting terminal value into our estimate of fair value 
the preparation of the long range forecasts  the selection of the discount rates and the estimation of the multiples used in valuing the terminal tear involve significant judgments 
changes to these assumptions could affect the estimated fair value of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period 
the assumptions and method in determining the fair value of our coalogix and energy security sonar solutions reporting unit have not materially changed since this was the first year that we have performed an impairment analysis for our gridsense and ussi subsidiaries as we began consolidating their results earlier in during the fourth quarter of  we determined that goodwill associated with the gridsense reporting unit was impaired and recorded a charge of million in our consolidated statements of operations 
we believe that the continuing global economic crisis and lower than expected sales by gridsense during the period since our acquisition of the remaining shares of gridsense not previously owned by us led to the impairment charge 
in addition to the goodwill impairment analysis  we also analyzed gridsense intangible assets for impairment 
no impairment was found 
also during the fourth quarter of  we recorded an impairment of million effective october  with respect to all of the goodwill associated with our coreworx subsidiary following our decision to stop funding coreworx operations 
at the same time  we also recorded an impairment charge of the remaining unamortized balance of all the coreworx amortizable intangible assets million 
impairment charges related to coreworx are included in loss from discontinued operations following the sale of our shares in the company in a management buyout transaction 
in the fourth quarter of  we also evaluated the goodwill associated with our coalogix  energy security sonar solutions and ussi reporting units for impairment and determined that the fair values of the reporting units exceeded their carrying values on that date 
should certain assumptions used in the development of the fair values of our reporting units change  we may be required to recognize additional goodwill impairments 
the estimated fair values of the coalogix  energy security sonar solutions and ussi reporting units used in those analyses exceeded their carrying values by more than each 
we did not prepare updated interim goodwill impairment analyses as of december  for any reporting unit  as we believed  based on our financial performance during the fourth quarter of and the financial forecasts that there were no indicators of potential impairments 
revenue recognition in the year ended december   we recorded approximately million of revenues representing approximately of our consolidated revenues in our coalogix subsidiary 
revenues related to scr catalyst regeneration and cleaning services are recognized when the service is completed for each catalyst module 
customer acceptance is not required for regeneration and cleaning services in that coalogix s contracts currently provide that services are completed upon successful testing results in compliance with contract requirements 
from time to time  coalogix purchases spent catalyst modules for its inventory 
in the event that a customer purchases spent catalyst modules and enters a service contract for regeneration with coalogix  revenues are recognized upon successful testing results in compliance with contract requirements 
costs associated with performing scr catalyst regeneration and cleaning services are expensed in relation to revenue recognition  which is based on the extent of performance achieved 
revenue and costs are deferred when billing milestones precede the scheduled receipt of testing by independent third parties that confirm compliance with contract requirements 
in the situation where revenue is deferred due to collectability uncertainties  coalogix does not defer costs due to the uncertainties related to payment for such services 
there were no uncertainties of collectability as of december  revenue from time and materials service contracts  maintenance agreements and other services is recognized as services are provided 
in the year ended december   we recorded approximately million of revenues representing approximately of our consolidated revenues in our dsit subsidiary 
in  dsit derived approximately million or of its revenues from fixed price type contracts 
fixed price type contracts require the accurate estimation of the cost  scope and duration of each engagement 
revenue and the related costs for these projects are recognized for a particular period  using the percentage of completion method as costs primarily direct labor are incurred  with revisions to estimates reflected in the period in which changes become known 
if we do not accurately estimate the resources required or the scope of work to be performed  or do not manage our projects properly within the planned periods of time or satisfy our obligations under the contracts  then future revenue and consulting margins may be significantly and negatively affected and losses on existing contracts may need to be recognized 
any such resulting changes in revenues and reductions in margins or contract losses could be material to our results of operations 
in  during the period since our acquisition of shares that we didn t previously own may   gridsense recorded approximately million of revenue representing approximately of our consolidated revenue for the year 
revenue from sales of gridsense monitoring equipment is recognized at the time title to the equipment and significant risks of ownership pass to the customer  which is generally upon shipment when all significant contractual obligations have been satisfied and collection is reasonably assured 
revenue from customer support services on monitoring equipment includes sales of parts and servicing of equipment 
sales of parts revenue is recognized when the parts are shipped to the customer or when the part is installed in the customer equipment 
servicing of equipment revenue is recognized as the related service work is performed 
foreign currency transactions the currency of the primary economic environment in which our corporate headquarters and our us subsidiaries operate is the united states dollar dollar 
accordingly  the company and all of its us subsidiaries use the dollar as their functional currency 
dsit s functional currency is the new israeli shekel nis while gridsense s functional currency for its australian operations is the australian dollar aus 
in the year ended december   of our consolidated revenues in the year ended december  came from our dsit subsidiary while of our consolidated revenue in the year ended december  came from gridsense s australian subsidiary 
their financial statements have been translated using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
statements of operations amounts have been translated using the average exchange rate for the year or the specific exchange rate on the date of a specific transaction 
all exchange gains and losses denominated in non functional currencies are reflected in finance expense  net in the consolidated statement of operations when they arise 
stock based compensation we recognize share based compensation expense based on the fair value recognition provision of applicable accounting principles  using the black scholes option valuation method 
accordingly  we are required to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award and to recognize that cost over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
under the black scholes method  we make assumptions with respect to the expected lives of the options that have been granted and are outstanding  the expected volatility and the dividend yield percentage of our common stock and the risk free interest rate at the respective dates of grant 
the expected volatility factor used to value stock options in was based on the historical volatility of the market price of the company s common stock over a period equal to the estimated weighted average life of the options 
for the expected term of the option  we used an estimate of the expected option life based on historical experience 
the risk free interest rate used is based upon us treasury yields for a period consistent with the expected term of the options 
historically  we have not paid dividends and we do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future  accordingly  our expected dividend rate is zero 
we recognize this expense on an accelerated basis over the requisite service period 
due to the numerous assumptions involved in calculating share based compensation expense  the expense recognized in our consolidated financial statements may differ significantly from the value realized by employees on exercise of the share based instruments 
in accordance with the prescribed methodology  we do not adjust our recognized compensation expense to reflect these differences 
recognition of share based compensation expense had  and will likely continue to have  a material effect on our selling  general and administrative and other items within our consolidated statements of operations and also may have a material effect on our deferred income taxes and additional paid in capital line items within our consolidated balance sheets 
we are also required to use judgment in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual forfeitures differ significantly from the original estimate  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
for each of the years ended december  and  we incurred stock compensation expense of approximately million and million  respectively 
the and expense each includes approximately million of stock compensation expense recorded with respect to stock option grants in our coalogix subsidiary 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for the assumptions used to calculate the fair value of share based employee compensation

revenues increased by million or to million in as compared to sales of million in the increase in revenue was due to the increase in coalogix revenue of million to million compared to revenue of million 
dsit s revenue also increased million from million to million 
our sales also include million and million of sales by our recently acquired gridsense and ussi subsidiaries whose results since our acquisition are included in our results for the increase in coalogix revenue was due to continued penetration in the regeneration market combined with the ability to process more scr modules facilitated by the completion the steele creek facility in the third quarter of the increase in dsit energy security sonar solutions revenues was due to increased revenues from dsit aquashieldtm projects 
gross profit 
gross profit in increased by million or  to million from million in both coalogix and dsit recorded increased gross profits million or for coalogix and million or for dsit 
our gross profit also includes million of gross profit by our recently acquired gridsense subsidiary whose results since our acquisition are included in our results for ussi s contribution to our gross profit since our acquisition of it was negligible 
the increase in both coalogix and dsit gross profits were almost wholly attributable to the increase in sales as gross margins decreased slightly 
gross margin for coalogix decreased slightly from in to in due mostly to startup activities and related increased resources associated with the opening of the steele creek facility 
consolidated gross margin at dsit was in  a slight decrease from in research and development expenses r d 
r d of million in reflects an increase of million or as compared to our r d includes million and million of r d by our recently acquired gridsense and ussi subsidiaries whose results since our acquisition are included in our results for impairments

the impairment was with respect to previously recorded goodwill associated with our gridsense subsidiary 
the impairment was recorded following our annual impairment analysis which is performed in the fourth quarter 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a

dsit s increased sg a costs primarily reflect increased marketing costs as well as increased salary costs and non recurring provisions recorded associated with salary adjustments 
increased corporate general and administrative costs reflect bonuses recorded in the first half of combined with increased administrative and salary costs and professional and investor relation fees 
loss on sale of enertech 
in december  we sold our investment in enertech and received proceeds of approximately million 
we recorded a loss of approximately million on the sale 
as a result of the sale  we no longer have any commitment to fund capital calls in enertech 
discontinued operations 
on december   we entered into an agreement to sell all of our common stock in coreworx to a management buyout group consisting of coreworx management and certain employees and other investors 
as a result  all of coreworx s net activity for a loss of million through that date which includes a charge of million with respect to the impairment of the goodwill and intangibles associated with coreworx 
in addition  we recorded a gain of million on the disposition of coreworx which is comprised of a gain of million on the deconsolidation of coreworx assets and liabilities less a full provision on coreworx debt of million due to us from coreworx following the management buyout transaction and an estimated million of legal fees 
net loss 
we had a net loss of million in compared with net loss of million in our loss in was primarily due to losses associated with our former coreworx subsidiary which are reflected in discontinued operations million of losses is losses from discontinued operation partially offset by the gain of million on the deconsolidation of coreworx 
in addition  coalogix losses of million  gridsense and ussi losses since our acquisition of million which includes a non cash million impairment charge against goodwill and million  respectively  corporate expenses of million and a loss of million on the sale of our enertech investment which were partially offset by net income from our dsit subsidiary of million  million of non controlling interests share in our losses and a gain of million we recorded with respect to the step up of the previous carrying value of our investment in gridsense to fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for step acquisitions 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had working capital of million  including million of cash and cash equivalents and not including current and non current restricted deposits of million of which approximately million has already been released 
net cash used in the year ending december   was million  which included million used in operating activities from continuing operations 
the primary use of cash in operating activities from continuing operations during was the cash used in operations in our corporate operations of million 
in addition  our coalogix  gridsense and ussi subsidiaries used million  and million  respectively  in their operating activities in dsit generated approximately million of cash from its operating activities during net cash of million was used in investing activities during our primary uses of cash during were million used for the acquisition of property and equipment primarily at coalogix for its new steele creek facility  approximately million used in the acquisition of gridsense net of cash acquired  and million used to fund capitals call at enertech 
these uses of cash were partially offset by the proceeds of million from the sale of our interests in enertech at the end of net cash of million was provided for in financing activities  primarily from the two financing transactions we had in which netted us approximately million after transaction costs 
in addition  million of cash from financing activities was provided by an investment made by enertech and coalogix management in coalogix  million of proceeds from the exercise of warrants and employee stock options and million from the proceeds of short term and long term borrowings net of repayments 
at december   dsit had approximately million in israeli credit lines available to it from two israeli banks approximately  from each bank  nearly all of which was then being used 
dsit s credit lines at one bank are available to it until june and at the second bank until january the credit lines at the bank whose term expires in june are expected to be renewed for another year at terms similar to current terms 
the lines of credit are denominated in nis and bear interest at a weighted average rate of the israeli prime rate per annum plus 
the israeli prime rate fluctuates and as of december  was 
the lines of credit are subject to maintaining certain financial covenants 
at december   dsit was in compliance with its financial covenants 
the company has a floating lien and provided guarantees with respect to dsit s outstanding lines of credit 
as at december   dsit also has an outstanding term loan from an israeli bank in the amount of approximately  the loan is denominated in nis and bears interest at the rate of the israeli prime rate per annum plus 
the loan is to be repaid over a period of months of equal payments of approximately  per month principal and interest 
as collateral for the term loan  dsit has deposited with an israeli bank approximately  as a non current restricted deposit 
in addition to this restricted deposit  dsit has also deposited with two israeli banks approximately million as collateral for various performance and bank guarantees for various projects as well as for its credit facilities at the banks 
dsit expects that these deposits will be released during  but expects to redeposit a majority of these funds again as collateral for new guarantees for new projects and for renewing its credit facilities 
on february   dsit had approximately million of cash of which million was restricted million current and million non current and was utilizing approximately  of its lines of credit 
we believe that dsit will have sufficient liquidity to finance its activities from cash flows from its own operations over the next months 
this is based on continued utilization of its line of credit and expected continued improvement of operating results from anticipated growth in sales 
in july   the subsidiaries of coalogix executed an amendment of its credit facility which extended and increased its credit availability to a million formula based line of credit  a million non formula based line of credit and million non formula based letter of credit 
the credit facility expires june  and carries an interest rate of the greater of above prime rate or on the formula line of credit and the greater of above prime rate or on the non formula line of credit 
the us prime rate at december  was 
coalogix expects to be able to renew the credit for another year at terms similar to current terms 
the maximum amount of outstanding credit under the facility is million 
at december   coalogix was utilizing  of the formula based line of credit 
the credit facility is subject to certain financial covenants 
coalogix was in compliance with its financial covenants at december  on february   coalogix had million including approximately million of restricted cash of cash on hand and was utilizing approximately million of its lines of credit 
we believe that coalogix will have sufficient liquidity to finance its operating activities and bank financing over the next months 
this is based on continued utilization of its line of credit and expected continued improvement of operating results from anticipated growth in sales 
we expect that gridsense will continue to require additional working capital support in order to finance its working capital needs in during the period from january  february   we have lent gridsense  additional support for gridsense for may be in the form of a bank line  new investment by others  additional investment by acorn  or a combination of the above 
there is no assurance that such support will be available from such sources in sufficient amounts  in a timely manner and on acceptable terms 
the availability and amount of any additional investment from acorn in gridsense may be limited by the working capital needs of acorn s corporate activities and other operating companies 
ussi currently has no other sources of financing other than its internally generated sales and the funds from the exercise of our options 
since january   we have invested million in ussi through the exercise of our options 
as of february   ussi had cash on hand of approximately million 
we have another option to invest an additional million on may  if we do not exercise this option  we have no assurance that ussi will not need additional financing from time to time to finance its working capital needs 
additional financing for ussi in may be in the form of a bank line  new investment by others  additional investment by acorn  or a combination of the above 
there is no assurance that such support will be available from such sources in sufficient amounts  in a timely manner and on acceptable terms 
the amount of any additional investment from us in ussi may be limited by the working capital needs of our corporate activities and other operating companies 
as at february   the company s corporate operations not including cash at any of our subsidiaries had a total of approximately million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents reflecting a million decrease from the balance as of december  the decrease in unrestricted corporate cash is due primarily to a million investment in ussi as a result of our option exercises  loans of  to gridsense and approximately  of corporate expenses 
those expenditures were partially offset by the release of  of restricted cash 
we believe that our current cash plus the cash generated from operations and borrowing from available lines of credit  if necessary will provide more than sufficient liquidity to finance the activities of acorn and its operating companies for the foreseeable future and for the next months in particular 
contractual obligations and commitments the table below provides information concerning obligations under certain categories of our contractual obligations as of december  cash payments due to contractual obligations years ending december  in thousands total and thereafter bank debt and utilized lines of credit capital leases obligations and other debt operating leases potential severance obligations purchase commitments royalties total contractual cash obligations we expect to finance these contractual commitments from cash currently on hand and cash generated from operations 
under israeli law and labor agreements  dsit is required to make severance payments to dismissed employees and to employees leaving employment under certain other circumstances 
the obligation for severance pay benefits  as determined by the israeli severance pay law  is based upon length of service and last salary 
these obligations are substantially covered by regular deposits with recognized severance pay and pension funds and by the purchase of insurance policies 
as of december   we accrued a total of million for potential severance obligations to our israeli employees of which approximately million was funded 
certain information concerning off balance sheet arrangements our dsit subsidiary provides various performance  advance and tender guarantees as required in the normal course of its operations 
as at december   such guarantees totaled approximately million and a majority were due to expire through as security for a portion of these guarantees  acorn has deposited with an israeli bank  and dsit has deposited approximately million which is shown as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheets 
as dsit s restricted cash is released from the completion of projects and the end of the guarantees  it expects to provide additional security deposits for new guarantees for new projects throughout the calendar year 
our coalogix subsidiary provides various performance  advance and tender guarantees as required in the normal course of its operations 
as at december   such guarantees totaled approximately million and were due to expire through as a security for a portion of these guarantees  the company has deposited with a us bank approximately million which is shown as a restricted deposit on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
the company expects the entire restricted deposit to be released in impact of inflation and interest rate currency fluctuations in the normal course of business  we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates on our lines of credit million available and long term debt incurred million balance at december  to finance our operations in israel 
such lines of credit and loan bear interest at interest rates that are linked to the israeli prime rate at december  and at december  
our non us dollar monetary assets and liabilities net assets of approximately million at december  in israel are exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates 
furthermore  million of our backlog of projects are contracts and orders that are denominated in nis 
historically  a majority of dsit s sales have been denominated in dollars or denominated in nis linked to the dollar 
such sales transactions are negotiated in dollars  however  for the convenience of the customer they are often settled in nis 
these transaction amounts are linked to the dollar between the date the transactions are entered into until the date they are effected and billed 
from the time these transactions are effected and billed through the date of settlement  amounts are primarily unlinked 
as dsit increases its sales to customers outside of israel  a greater portion of its receipts from customers will be settled in dollars 
in  we expect a significant portion of dsit s sales to be settled in dollars 
a significant majority of dsit s expenses in israel are in nis primarily labor costs  while a portion is in dollars or dollar linked nis 
the dollar cost of our operations in israel may be adversely affected in the future by a revaluation of the nis in relation to the dollar 
in the appreciation of the nis against the dollar was while in it was 
as of december   virtually all of dsit s monetary assets and liabilities that were not denominated in dollars or dollar linked nis were denominated in nis 
in the event that in the future we have material net monetary assets or liabilities that are not denominated in dollar linked nis  such net assets or liabilities would be subject to the risk of currency fluctuations 
dsit purchases forward contracts to attempt to reduce its exposure to currency fluctuations 
in addition  our non us dollar assets and liabilities net liability of approximately million at december  in australia at our gridsense subsidiary s australian operations are also exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates 
the dollar cost of our operations in australia may also be adversely affected in the future by a revaluation of the australian dollar in relation to the us dollar 
in the appreciation of the australian dollar against the us dollar was summary quarterly financial data unaudited the following table sets forth certain of our unaudited quarterly consolidated financial information for the years ended december  and this information should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto
