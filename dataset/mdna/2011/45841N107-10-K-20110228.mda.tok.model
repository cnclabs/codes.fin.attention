in addition to historical information  the following discussion also contains forward looking statements that include risks and uncertainties

business overview we are an automated global electronic market maker and broker specializing in routing orders and executing and processing trades in securities  futures and foreign exchange instruments on more than electronic exchanges and trading venues around the world 
since our inception in  we have focused on developing proprietary software to automate broker dealer functions 
the advent of electronic exchanges in the last years has provided us with the opportunity to integrate our software with an increasing number of exchanges and trading venues into one automatically functioning  computerized platform that requires minimal human intervention 
in connection with the ipo priced on may   ibg  inc purchased of the membership interests in ibg llc  became the sole managing member of ibg llc and began to consolidate ibg llc financial results into its financial statements 
overview of recapitalization transactions and our organizational structure prior to the ipo  we had historically conducted our business through a limited liability company structure 
our primary assets are our ownership of approximately of the membership interests of ibg llc  the current holding company for our businesses  and our controlling interest and related contractual rights as the sole managing member of ibg llc 
the remaining approximately of ibg llc membership interests are held by ibg holdings llc  a holding company that is owned by our founder  chairman and chief executive officer  thomas peterffy  and his affiliates  management and other employees of ibg llc  and certain other members 
the ibg llc membership interests held by ibg holdings llc will be subject to purchase by us over time in connection with offerings by us of shares of our common stock 
purchases of ibg llc membership interests  held by ibg holdings llc  by the company are governed by the exchange agreement by and among the company  ibg holdings llc  ibg llc and the members of ibg llc  dated as of may  the exchange agreement  a copy of the fully executed agreement was filed as an exhibit to our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended september  and filed with the sec on november  under the exchange agreement  ibg holdings llc may request redemption of its membership interests in ibg llc and the company is required to use its commercially reasonable efforts to consummate a public offering of a number of shares of class a common stock approximately equal to the aggregate number of the ibg holdings llc membership interests for which redemption has been requested 
upon consummation of such public offering  the company is required to purchase from ibg holdings llc that number of ibg llc membership interests equal to the aggregate number of the ibg holdings llc membership interests subject to redemption  at a purchase price per membership interest equal to the offering price in such public offering 
however  under the exchange agreement  the company is not obligated to effect any purchase of the ibg llc membership interests held by ibg holdings llc unless and until the company has consummated a public offering of a number of shares of class a common stock approximately equal to the aggregate number of the ibg holdings llc membership interests subject to redemption 
in  and  public offerings were not consummated 

table of contents as an alternative  at the option of  and upon mutual agreement of  the company  ibg holdings llc and ibg llc  instead of  or in addition to  consummating one or more public offerings  redemptions of ibg holdings llc membership interests may be effected by using cash on hand at ibg llc and corresponding redemptions by ibg llc of its membership interests held by ibg holdings llc 
this alternative funding method would not impose any obligations on the company 
in  and some of the ibg holdings llc membership interests were  in fact  redeemed using cash from ibg llc 
as part of a redeployment of the company capital to its shareholders  the company effected a series of dividend payments  including a dividend of per share  which was paid to the company common shareholders in december we have made no determination as to whether to pay any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
business segments the company reports its results in two business segments  market making and electronic brokerage 
these segments are analyzed separately as we derive our revenues from these two principal business activities as well as allocate resources and assess performance 
market making 
we conduct our market making business through our th subsidiaries 
as one of the largest market makers on many of the world leading exchanges  we provide liquidity by offering competitively tight bid offer spreads over a broad base of over  tradable  exchange listed products 
as principal  we commit our own capital and derive revenues or incur losses from the difference between the price paid when securities are bought and the price received when those securities are sold 
because we provide continuous bid and offer quotations and we are continuously both buying and selling quoted securities  we may have either a long or a short position in a particular product at a given point in time 
our entire portfolio is evaluated each second and continuously rebalanced throughout the trading day  thus minimizing the risk of our portfolio at all times 
this real time rebalancing of our portfolio  together with our real time proprietary risk management system  enables us to curtail risk and to be profitable in both up market and down market scenarios 
electronic brokerage 
we conduct our electronic brokerage business through our ib subsidiaries 
as an electronic broker  we execute  clear and settle trades globally for both institutional and individual customers 
capitalizing on the technology originally developed for our market making business  ib systems provide our customers with the capability to monitor multiple markets around the world simultaneously and to execute trades electronically in these markets at a low cost  in multiple products and currencies from a single trading account 
we offer our customers access to all classes of tradable  exchange listed products  including stocks  bonds  options  futures  forex and mutual funds traded on more than exchanges and market centers and in countries around the world seamlessly 
business environment the past year was marked by two major events the signing of the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act into law and the may th flash crash 
it is difficult to predict what rule changes will be implemented by the regulators as a result of the dodd frank legislation and what impact these changes will have on our business 
as a well capitalized market participant and a registered market maker  we would view stricter capital requirements and increased regulation over otc derivatives as  on balance  positive 

table of contents the immediately noticeable fall out from may  on the business environment for  was the reduction of trading by the retail and  to a lesser extent  the institutional investor  which also resulted in diminished volatilities in the markets 
as a result of the flash crash  rule changes may be implemented in the future that would increase regulation of high frequency traders hfts and curtail naked sponsored access  a practice whereby hfts can send orders directly to an exchange by using an exchange member access and bypassing that exchange member pre trade risk controls 
however  the only changes that were implemented in were the circuit breakers that place trading restrictions on stocks that exhibit substantial price moves  which had no impact on our operations 
during  global volumes in exchange traded derivatives continued to grow  while markets were generally calmer than the preceding year  with the exception of the brief spike in volatility around the may th event 
we continued to face challenging conditions as market makers  including intense competition from high frequency traders  historically tight bid offer spreads and low volatility levels 
these factors were exacerbated by currency movements that negatively impacted our reported earnings 
since we typically maintain an overall long volatility position  which protects us against a severe market dislocation in either direction  our market making profits are generally correlated with market volatility 
based on the chicago board options exchange volatility index vix  the average volatility level fell approximately compared to the ratio of actual to implied volatility is also meaningful to our results 
because the cost of hedging our positions is based on implied volatility  while our trading profits are  in part  based on actual market volatility  a higher ratio is generally favorable and a lower ratio generally has a negative effect on our trading gains 
during  this ratio averaged approximately compared to approximately in lower volatility levels also contributed to the trend of contracting bid offer spreads that began in late during  spreads  as reported by the nasdaq omx phlx market  were approximately narrower than in currency fluctuations negatively impacted our reported earnings  as measured in us dollars 
as a global market maker trading on exchanges around the world in multiple currencies  we are exposed to foreign currency risk 
we actively hedge this exposure by keeping our net worth in proportion to a defined basket of major currencies we call the global 
the overall impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes on our equity in was relatively small 
however  us gaap accounting convention resulted in a gain being reported in the consolidated statement of financial condition  while a loss was reported in the consolidated statement of income 
further detail is provided below in the section entitled non gaap financial measures 
in addition  a discussion of our approach to managing foreign currency exposure is contained in part ii  item a of this annual report on form k entitled quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
according to data received from exchanges worldwide  volumes in exchange listed equity based options increased in by approximately globally and in the us  compared to during the year we accounted for approximately of the exchange listed equity based options including options on etfs and stock index products volume traded worldwide and approximately of exchange listed equity based options volume traded in the us this compares to approximately of the exchange listed equity based options volume traded worldwide and approximately of the exchange listed equity based options volume traded in the us compared to we believe the decrease in our market share can partly be attributed to the surge in high frequency trading firms and certain advantages they had over registered market makers  which had allowed them to take a larger share of the listed options volume 
see the tables on pages of this annual report on form k for additional details regarding our trade volumes  contract and share volumes and brokerage statistics

diluted earnings per share were for the year ended december  in december  the company paid a dividend of per share to holders of the company common stock which had a negative impact on our earnings per share of approximately for the year ended december  on a consolidated reporting basis  the dividends had no effect on our reported income before tax 
however  the us federal income tax liability triggered by the dividends is reported as income tax expense in the consolidated statement of income 
the above dividend resulted from the following transaction 
on december   timber hill europe ag the ag paid its sole shareholder  ibg llc  a dividend of million 
the ag pretax earnings had not previously been subject to taxation in the united states

our results in any given period may be materially affected by volumes in the global financial markets  the level of competition and other factors 
electronic brokerage is more predictable  but it is dependent on customer activity  growth in customer accounts and assets  interest rates and other factors 
for a further discussion of the factors  that may affect our future operating results  please see the description of risk factors in part i  item a of this annual report on form k
