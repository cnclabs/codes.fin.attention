our discussion is organized as follows overview 
this section provides a general description of our business and operating expenses 
recent developments 
this section provides a general description of recent events and significant transactions that we believe are important in understanding our financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates 
this section contains a discussion of the accounting policies that we believe are important to our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in their application 
in addition  all of our significant accounting policies  including the critical accounting policies and estimates  are summarized in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
results of operations 
this section provides an analysis of our results of operations presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations by comparing the results for the year ended december  to the results for the year ended december  and comparing the results for the year ended december  to the results for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources 
this section provides an analysis of our cash flows and a discussion of our outstanding commitments and contingencies that existed as of december  included in this discussion is our financial capacity to fund our future commitments and a discussion of other financing arrangements 
overview we are a biotechnology company focused on the development of small molecule therapeutics for the treatment of serious diseases 
we have the following product candidates in development  including lesinurad previously called rdea an inhibitor of the urat kidney transporter for the treatment of hyperuricemia and gout  next generation urat inhibitors next generation urat kidney transporter inhibitors for the treatment of hyperuricemia and gout  and bay formerly known as rdea a mek inhibitor for the treatment of cancer 
revenue to date  our revenue has come from upfront license fees  milestones  research and development funding  including reimbursable research and development costs and sponsored research  in connection with collaboration arrangements 
we anticipate that the majority of our revenues in the near future will be derived from research and development payments 
we may receive additional milestone payments in the future upon the achievement of certain goals set forth in our license agreement with bayer 
research and development expense research and development expenses primarily consist of costs associated with the development and clinical trials of our product candidates  costs associated with our ongoing research programs  salaries and share based compensation for research and development personnel and facility costs 

table of contents at this time  due to the risks inherent in the clinical trial process and given the early stage of development of our product candidates and lead compounds from our research programs  we are unable to estimate with any certainty the costs we will incur in the continued development of our product candidates for commercialization 
other than costs for outsourced services associated with our clinical programs  we generally do not track our research and development expenses by project  rather  we track such expenses by the type of cost incurred 
due to these same factors  we are unable to determine the anticipated completion dates for our current research and development projects 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense primarily consist of salaries  share based compensation and other related costs for personnel in executive  finance and accounting  business development  investor relations  information technology  legal and human resource functions 
other general and administrative costs include professional fees for legal  accounting and other general corporate purposes  and facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expense 
other income expense other income expense primarily consists of the interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments available for sale  net of interest expense 
recent developments in december  the united states adopted names council usan adopted lesinurad  pronounced le sin ure ad  as the usan name for rdea in january  we announced positive  top line results from a phase b study study in allopurinol refractory gout patients demonstrating that adding lesinurad to allopurinol produced highly statistically significant additional reductions in sua of up to percent over that observed on allopurinol alone 
using a last observation carried forward locf analysis  which was the method utilized for the us approval of febuxostat  percent of patients taking the combination achieved the medically recommended target of reducing sua to below mg dl at the highest lesinurad dose tested 
response rates on this study increased in a dose related manner and were highly clinically and statistically significant at all dose levels when compared to allopurinol alone 
the combination of lesinurad and allopurinol was also well tolerated  with no serious adverse events and only two discontinuations due to adverse events on the combination 
in february  we completed an underwritten public offering of  shares of our common stock  including the full exercise of the overallotment option granted to the underwriters  at a price of per share 
net proceeds from the sale of the shares  before expenses and after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions  were approximately million 
in january  we received a million milestone payment from bayer healthcare ag bayer triggered by the initiation of a phase clinical study of bay in combination with sorafenib nexavar  bayer  onyx pharmaceuticals in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma or primary liver cancer 
bay  formerly known as rdea  is a potent  non atp competitive  highly selective inhibitor of mitogen activated erk kinase mek 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis  including those related to revenues  accrued clinical liabilities and share based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on 
table of contents other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis of making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our collaboration arrangements may contain multiple elements and we may be eligible for payments made in the form of upfront license fees  research funding  cost reimbursement  milestone payments and royalties 
revenue from upfront  nonrefundable license fees is recognized over the period that any related services are provided 
amounts received for research funding are recognized as revenues as the research services that are the subject of such funding are performed 
revenue derived from reimbursement of research and development costs in transactions where we act as a principal are recorded as revenue for the gross amount of the reimbursement  and the costs associated with these reimbursements are reflected as a component of research and development expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
revenue from milestones is recognized when earned  as evidenced by written acknowledgement from the collaborator or other persuasive evidence that the milestone has been achieved  provided that the milestone event is substantive and its achievability was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement 
revenues recognized for royalty payments  if any  will be based upon actual net sales of the licensed compounds  as provided by the collaboration arrangement  in the period the sales occur 
any amounts received prior to satisfying our revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet 
accrued clinical liabilities we review and accrue clinical costs based on work performed  which relies on estimates of the services received from other parties and related expenses incurred 
clinical trial related contracts vary significantly in duration  and may be for a fixed amount  based on milestones or deliverables  a variable amount based on actual costs incurred  capped at a certain limit  or contain a combination of these elements 
revisions are charged to expense in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
historically  revisions have not resulted in material changes to research and development costs  however  a modification in the protocol of a clinical trial or cancellation of a trial could result in a charge to our results of operations 
share based compensation we grant equity based awards under three stockholder approved  share based compensation plans 
we have granted  and may in the future grant  options and restricted stock awards to employees  directors  consultants and advisors under either our non officer equity incentive plan or our stock incentive plan 
in addition  all of our employees are eligible to participate in our employee stock purchase plan  which enables employees to purchase common stock at a discount through payroll deductions 
we estimate the fair value of stock options granted using the black scholes merton  or black scholes  option valuation model 
this fair value is then amortized over the requisite service periods of the awards 
the black scholes option valuation model requires the input of subjective assumptions  including each option s expected life and price volatility of the underlying stock 
expected volatility is based on our historical stock price volatility 
the expected life of employee stock options represents the average of the contractual term of the options and the weighted average vesting period  as permitted under the simplified method 
as share based compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience 
changes in assumptions used under the black scholes option valuation model could materially affect our net loss and net loss per share

results of operations years ended december  and revenues for the year ended december   revenues increased to million from million for the year ended december  the increase in revenues in as compared to was primarily due to the recognition of the first milestone payment under our license agreement with bayer 
in addition  the increase was due to an increase in reimbursable research and development costs associated with the continued progression of the ongoing clinical trials of bay rdea 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in license fee revenue recognized under our license agreement with bayer to million in from million for the same period in the million upfront license fee was originally being recognized on a straight line basis over a period of approximately months  which was the original period in which we expected to complete all of our obligations under the license agreement 
in december and again in september  we revised our estimate of this period as a result of modifications to our ongoing bay rdea clinical trials  extending it to months 
the deferred balance of the license fee as of the date of the change in estimate is being recognized over the revised timeline 
research and development expense for the year ended december   research and development expense increased to million from million for the same period in the increase in research and development expense was primarily due to the continued development and progression of our clinical and preclinical programs  resulting in increased spending of approximately million on clinical research organizations  investigator grants and consultants 
in addition  there was an increase in non cash  share based compensation expense of approximately million  resulting primarily from the termination of certain employees during the third quarter of these increases were partially offset by a decrease in personnel and related costs as a result of savings from our may restructuring and an offset to research and development expense of million  during the fourth quarter of  in connection a government grant received under the patient protection and affordable care act 
general and administrative expense for the year ended december   general and administrative expense increased to million from million for the same period in the increase in general and administrative expense was primarily a result of an increase in non cash  share based compensation expense of approximately million mainly due to the departure of certain employees during the third quarter of general and administrative expense also increased as a result of an increase in personnel and related costs and consulting and professional outside services of approximately million 
other income expense for the year ended december   other income expense decreased to million net other expense from million net other expense for the same period in the decrease in other expense was primarily a result of a decrease in interest expense in connection with our growth capital loan  tenant improvements loan and capital lease obligations entered into in the second half of years ended december  and revenues for the year ended december   revenues increased to million from million for the year ended december  the revenue earned in primarily resulted from the recognition of approximately 
table of contents million of the million upfront  non refundable license fee and reimbursement of third party development costs associated with our mek inhibitor program under the terms of our license agreement with bayer 
the revenue earned in fiscal resulted from the research services we provided under our master services agreement with valeant  which has since terminated by its terms 
research and development expense for the year ended december   research and development expense decreased to million from million for the same period in the decrease in research and development expense was primarily due to an approximate million reduction in discovery research and clinical development expenditures on programs other than our gout related programs 
research and development expense also decreased approximately million as a result of savings from our may restructuring 
in addition  the decrease was a result of approximately million in one time facility related expenses incurred in the first quarter of in connection with our facility relocation and decreased monthly rent and common area maintenance charges for the san diego facility  which we occupied beginning in march these decreases were partially offset by severance related charges of approximately million recorded in in connection with our may restructuring 
in addition  research and development expense was also partially offset by an increase in share based compensation expense of approximately million in as compared to general and administrative expense for the year ended december   general and administrative expense decreased to million from million for the same period in the decrease in general and administrative expense was primarily a result of one time costs of approximately million incurred in related to the facility relocation 
in addition  the decrease in general and administrative expense was the result of a decrease in consulting and professional outside services of approximately million  and a decrease in personnel and related costs due to a decrease in headcount of approximately million for the year ended december  as compared to these decreases were partially offset by an increase in share based compensation expense of approximately million in as compared to other income expense for the year ended december   other income expense decreased to million net other expense from million net other income for the same period in the decrease in other income expense was primarily a result of an increase in interest expense in connection with our growth capital loan and capital lease obligations entered into in the second half of and a decrease in interest income due to lower average interest rates and lower average cash balances as compared to liquidity and capital resources from inception through december   we have incurred a cumulative net loss of approximately million  of which million was incurred subsequent to the closing of the asset acquisition from valeant and the commencement of operating activities as ardea biosciences  inc we have financed our operations through public and private offerings of securities  revenues from collaborative arrangements  proceeds from our growth capital loan and interest income from invested cash balances 
in february  we completed an underwritten public offering of  shares of our common stock  including the full exercise of the overallotment option granted to the underwriters  at a price of per share 
the net proceeds to us from the sale of shares in this offering was approximately million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions but before deducting offering expenses 
in november  we received approximately million from a government grant under the patient protection and affordable care act 
in april  we completed a public offering of  shares of our common stock  including  shares sold pursuant to the full exercise of an overallotment option granted to the underwriters 
the 
table of contents net proceeds to us from the sale of shares in the offering was approximately million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses 
in may  we committed to a restructuring plan the restructuring plan intended to conserve our financial resources by focusing on our clinical stage programs 
in combination with other employee attrition since january   the restructuring plan resulted in a reduction of approximately of our workforce from december  levels  with the majority coming from discovery research and associated administrative personnel 
cost savings from the restructuring plan  net of severance and related costs  were approximately million in in april  we entered into our license agreement with bayer 
under the terms of the license agreement  we have granted to bayer a worldwide  exclusive license to develop and commercialize our mek inhibitors for all indications 
in partial consideration for the license  bayer paid us a non refundable upfront cash fee of million 
bayer is responsible for reimbursing us for third party development costs associated with certain ongoing studies up to an amount specified in the license agreement 
for the year ended december   we recognized revenue associated with the reimbursement of these third party development costs of approximately million 
we believe that the amount available for reimbursement under the license agreement will be sufficient to offset all future third party development costs that we expect to incur through the completion of these studies as currently planned 
in january  we received the first milestone payment of million under the agreement from bayer as a result of their initiation of a phase study of bay rdea in combination with sorafenib in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma  or primary liver cancer 
we are eligible to receive additional cash payments totaling up to million upon achievement of additional development  regulatory and sales based milestones  as well as low double digit royalties on worldwide sales of products covered under the license agreement 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments  and million in receivables  compared to million in cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments  and million in receivables as of december  the net increase in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments for was primarily due to our april public offering  partially offset by the use of cash to fund our clinical stage programs  personnel costs and for other general corporate purposes 
the increase in receivables for was due to the first milestone under the license agreement with bayer having been earned in december and increased reimbursements of third party development costs and internal research and development costs associated with our mek inhibitor program under the license agreement 
under the asset purchase agreement with valeant  we will be required to pay valeant million after the first patient is dosed in the first phase b study for the nnrti program and million after the first patient is dosed in the first phase study for the mek inhibitor program 
as of december   the first milestone for the mek inhibitor program had been earned and the company recorded million to research and development expense in the fourth quarter of the million milestone payment was subsequently paid to valeant in january we also enter into agreements from time to time with clinical sites and contract research organizations for the conduct of our clinical trials 
we make payments to these sites and organizations based in part upon the number of patients enrolled and the length of their participation in the clinical trials 
under certain of these agreements  we may be subject to penalties in the event that we prematurely terminate these agreements 
at this time  due to the variability associated with clinical site and contract research organization agreements  we are unable to estimate with certainty the future costs we will incur 
we intend to use our current financial resources to fund our obligations under these commitments 
in addition  we have from time to time entered into employment agreements with our executives that  under certain cases  provide for the continuation of salary and certain other benefits if these executives are terminated under specified circumstances 
these agreements generally expire upon termination for cause or when we have met our obligations under these agreements 
in the third quarter of  we incurred expenses of approximately million related to continuation of salary and other benefits under employment agreements due to the departure of certain employees 

table of contents the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  long term debt and capital lease obligations include interest 
payment due by period less than more than total year years years years in thousands long term debt obligations operating lease obligations capital lease obligations purchase obligations total at december   purchase obligations primarily consisted of commitments with third party manufacturers of materials to be used in our clinical and preclinical studies  as well as commitments with various vendors for preclinical studies 
approximately million of the total purchase obligations were not included in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  we intend to use our current financial resources to fund our commitments under these purchase obligations 
our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous forward looking factors 
these factors may include  but are not limited to  the following the rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials and other research and development activities  the scope  prioritization and number of clinical development programs we pursue  the terms and timing of any collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that we may establish  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the costs and timing of regulatory approvals  the cost of establishing or contracting for manufacturing  sales and marketing capabilities  and the effect of competing technological and market developments 
we anticipate that our existing cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments will be sufficient to satisfy our current and projected funding requirements for at least the next months 
we have no current means of generating material cash flows from operations 
there can be no assurance that our product development efforts with respect to any of our product candidates will be successfully completed  that required regulatory approvals will be obtained  or that any products  if introduced  will be successfully marketed or achieve commercial acceptance 
until we can generate significant continuing revenues  we expect to satisfy our future cash needs through public or private equity offerings  debt financings and corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements  as well as through interest income earned on cash balances 
we cannot be certain that additional funding will be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
our ability to obtain new financing may be constrained by unfavorable economic conditions currently affecting financial markets and numerous other factors 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future effect on our consolidated financial condition  changes in our consolidated financial condition  expenses  consolidated results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital to fund operations  while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income we can earn on our investment portfolio 
our risk associated with fluctuating interest income is limited to our investments in interest rate sensitive financial instruments 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage this exposure to interest rate changes 
we seek to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in short term investment grade securities  such as treasury backed money market funds  corporate bonds  certificates of deposits and commercial paper 
due to the current market conditions  we no longer invest in asset backed securities 
in accordance with our investment policy  we do not invest in auction rate 
table of contents securities 
as a result of the short term nature of our investments  a basis point movement in market interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of our portfolio as of december  while changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of our investment portfolio  any gains or losses are not recognized in our statement of operations until the investment is sold or if a reduction in fair value is determined to be a permanent impairment 
we do not have any foreign currency or other derivative financial instruments
