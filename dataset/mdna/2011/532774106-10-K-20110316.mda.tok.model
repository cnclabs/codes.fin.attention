item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the remaining assets and liabilities of the banks broadcasting joint venture were sold in accordingly  our consolidated financial statements reflect the operations  assets and liabilities of the banks broadcasting joint venture station as discontinued for all periods presented 
executive summary we own  operate or service broadcast television stations and interactive television station and niche web sites in mid sized markets 
our operating revenues are derived primarily from the sale of advertising time to local  national and political advertisers and  to a lesser extent  from digital revenues  network compensation  barter and other revenues 
during  economic conditions improved compared to  which resulted in increased advertising in our markets 
we recorded net income of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  compared to net loss of million for the year ended december  our operating highlights for include the following total revenues increased million primarily due to economic recovery during compared to the prior year 
political revenues increased million in compared to the prior year as a result of the congressional  state and local elections that take place in even numbered years as well as growth in issue advertising compared to the prior year 
additionally  digital revenues increased million  or  compared to the prior year 
total revenues also included advertising revenue from the olympic winter games 
twelve out of fifteen of our top advertising categories for local and national advertising sales increased for compared to operating expenses decreased approximately million compared to primarily due to an impairment charge of million recorded during that did not recur during this decrease was partially offset by higher direct operating  selling  general and administrative and corporate expenses associated with rmm  our online advertising and media services business that was acquired in october  and increases in variable direct costs attributable to the growth in revenue compared to during the year ended december   we completed an offering of our senior notes senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of million 
proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes were used to repay million of principal on our revolving credit facility and million of principal on our term loans  plus accrued interest  pursuant to the mandatory prepayment terms of our senior secured credit facility 
the repayment of principal on our revolving credit facility resulted in a reduction of our revolving credit commitments  from million to million 
during the year ended december   pursuant to the shortfall funding agreements with nbcuniversal  we made shortfall loans in the aggregate principal amount of million to our joint venture with nbcuniversal 
we have a remaining shortfall funding accrual of million as of december   which we expect to fund during on may   we entered into a shared services arrangement and related agreements with acme communications  inc acme with respect to acme television stations kwbq tv  krwb tv  and kasy tv in the albuquerque santa fe  nm market  wbdt tv in the dayton  oh market  and wcwf tv f k a wiwb tv in the green bay appleton  wi market 
concurrent with the execution of these agreements  we entered into an option agreement  giving us the right to acquire any or all of the stations covered under the shared services and related agreements 
on august   we exercised our option to acquire wcwf tv and certain assets of wbdt tv  for consideration of approximately million 
completion of these transactions is subject to regulatory approvals and certain other terms and conditions 
although we expect these 
table of contents transactions to close during  please see federal regulation of television broadcasting local television ownership included in item business for a discussion of a third party challenge to certain pending applications at the fcc concerning these agreements 
critical accounting policies  estimates and recently issued accounting pronouncements certain of our accounting policies  as well as estimates we make  are critical to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations since they are particularly sensitive to our judgment 
some of these policies and estimates relate to matters that are inherently uncertain 
the estimates and judgments we make affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to intangible assets and goodwill  receivables and investments  program rights  income taxes  stock based compensation  employee medical insurance claims  pensions  useful lives of property and equipment  contingencies  barter transactions  acquired asset valuations and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  and it is possible that such differences could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
for additional information about these and other accounting policies  see note basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
we have discussed each of these critical accounting policies and related estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
valuation of long lived assets and intangible assets approximately million  or  of our total assets as of december  consisted of indefinite lived intangible assets 
intangible assets principally include broadcast licenses and goodwill 
if the fair value of these assets is less than the carrying value  we may be required to record an impairment charge 
we test the impairment of our broadcast licenses annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired 
the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of broadcast licenses with their carrying amount on a station by station basis using a discounted cash flow valuation method  assuming a hypothetical startup scenario 
the future value of our broadcast licenses could be significantly impaired by the loss of the corresponding network affiliation agreements 
accordingly  such an event could trigger an assessment of the carrying value of a broadcast license 
we test the impairment of our goodwill annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a station with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
the fair value of a station is determined through the use of a discounted cash flow analysis 
the valuation assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model reflect historical performance of the station and prevailing rates in the markets for broadcasters 
if the fair value of the station exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill is not considered impaired 
if the carrying amount of the station exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by performing a hypothetical purchase price allocation  using the station fair value as determined in the first step described above as the purchase price 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess  but not more than the carrying value of the goodwill 
an 
table of contents impairment assessment could be triggered by a significant reduction  or a forecast of such reductions  in operating results or cash flows at one or more of our television stations  a significant adverse change in the national or local advertising marketplaces in which our television stations operate  or by adverse changes to fcc ownership rules  among other factors 
the assumptions used in the valuation testing have certain subjective components including anticipated future operating results and cash flows based on our own internal business plans as well as future expectations about general economic and local market conditions 
the changes in the discount rate used for our broadcast licenses and goodwill reflected in the table below are primarily driven by changes in the average beta for the public equity of companies in the television and media sector and the average cost of capital in each of the periods 
the changes in the market growth rates and operating profit margins for both our broadcast licenses and goodwill reflect changes in the outlook for advertising revenues in certain markets where our stations operate in each of the periods 
we based the valuation of broadcast licenses on the following average industry based assumptions december  december  june  december  market revenue growth operating cash flow margins discount rate tax rate long term growth rate as of december   if we were to decrease the market revenue growth rate by  it would result in an impairment of million  a decrease in the market revenue growth rate would result in an impairment of million 
a decrease in operating profit margins would result in an impairment charge of million  while a decrease in operating profit margins would result in an impairment charge of million 
an increase of in the discount rate would result in an impairment charge of million  and a increase in the discount rate would result in an impairment charge of million 
the valuation of goodwill is based on the following assumptions  which take into account our internal projections and industry assumptions related to market revenue growth  operating cash flows and prevailing discount rates december  december  june  december  market revenue growth operating cash flow margins discount rate tax rate long term growth rate as of december   if we were to decrease the market revenue growth by and by of the projected growth rate  the enterprise value of our stations with goodwill would decrease by million and million  respectively 
if we were to decrease the operating profit margins by and from the projected operating profit margins  the enterprise value of our stations with goodwill would decrease by million and million  respectively 
if we were to increase the discount rate used in the valuation calculation by and  the enterprise value of our stations with goodwill would decrease by million and million  respectively 

table of contents network affiliations other broadcast companies may use different assumptions in valuing acquired broadcast licenses and their related network affiliations than those that we use 
these different assumptions may result in the use of valuation methods that can result in significant variances in the amount of purchase price allocated to these assets by these broadcast companies 
we believe that the value of a television station is derived primarily from the attributes of its broadcast license 
these attributes have a significant impact on the audience for network programming in a local television market compared to the national viewing patterns of the same network programming 
these attributes and their impact on audiences can include the scarcity of broadcast licenses assigned by the fcc to a particular market determines how many television networks and other program sources are viewed in a particular market  the length of time the broadcast license has been broadcasting 
television stations that have been broadcasting since the late s are viewed more often than newer television stations  the quality of the broadcast signal and location of the broadcast station within a market ie the value of being licensed in the smallest city within a tri city market has less value than being licensed in the largest city  the audience acceptance of the local news programming and community involvement of the local television station 
the local television station news programming that attracts the largest audience in a market generally will provide a larger audience for its network programming  and the quality of the other non network programming carried by the television station 
a local television station syndicated programming that attracts the largest audience in a market generally will provide larger audience lead ins to its network programming 
a local television station can be the top rated station in a market  regardless of the national ranking of its affiliated network  depending on the factors or attributes listed above 
abc  cbs  fox and nbc  each have affiliations with local television stations that have the largest primetime audience in the local market in which the station operates regardless of the network primetime rating 
some broadcasting companies believe that network affiliations are the most important component of the value of a station 
these companies generally believe that television stations with network affiliations have the most successful local news programming and the network affiliation relationship enhances the audience for local syndicated programming 
as a result  these broadcasting companies allocate a significant portion of the purchase price for any station that they may acquire to the network affiliation relationship 
we generally have acquired broadcast licenses in markets with a number of commercial television stations equal to or less than the number of television networks seeking affiliates 
the methodology we used in connection with the valuation of the stations acquired is based on our evaluation of the broadcast licenses and the characteristics of the markets in which they operated 
we believed that in substantially all our markets we would be able to replace a network affiliation agreement with little or no economic loss to our television station 
as a result of this assumption  we ascribed no incremental value to the incumbent network affiliation in substantially all our markets in which we operate beyond the cost of negotiating a new agreement with another network and the value of any terms that were more favorable or unfavorable than those generally prevailing in the market 
other broadcasting companies have valued network affiliations on the basis that it is the affiliation and not the other attributes of the station  including its broadcast license  which contributes to the operating performance of that station 
as a result  we believe that these broadcasting companies include in their network affiliation valuation amounts related to attributes that we believe are more appropriately reflected in the value of the broadcast license or goodwill 

table of contents in future acquisitions  the valuation of the broadcast licenses and network affiliations may differ from those attributable to our existing stations due to different facts and circumstances for each station and market being evaluated 
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  in the event that we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period in which such a determination was made 
revenue recognition we recognize advertising and other program related revenue during the period in which advertising or programs are aired on our television stations or carried by our web sites or the web sites of our advertiser network 
we recognize retransmission consent fees in the period in which our service is delivered 
stock based compensation we estimate the fair value of stock option awards using a black scholes valuation model 
the black scholes model requires us to make assumptions and judgments about the variables to be assumed in the calculation  including the option expected life  the price volatility of the underlying stock and the number of stock option awards that are expected to be forfeited 
the expected life represents the weighted average period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding giving consideration to vesting schedules and our historical exercise patterns 
expected volatility is based on historical trends for our class a common stock over the expected term  and prior to  we used the historical trends of our class a common stock over the expected term  as well as a comparison to peer companies 
expected forfeitures are estimated using our historical experience 
if future changes in estimates differ significantly from our current estimates  our future stock based compensation expense and results of operations could be materially impacted 
retirement plan we have historically provided a defined benefit retirement plan to our employees who did not receive matching contributions from our company to their k plan accounts 
our pension benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts 
our defined benefit plan is a non contributory plan under which we made contributions either to a traditional plan participants based on periodic actuarial valuations  which are expensed over the expected average remaining service lives of current employees  or b cash balance plan participants based on of each participant eligible compensation 
effective april   this plan was frozen and we do not expect to make additional benefit accruals to this plan  however we will continue to fund our existing vested obligations 
we contributed million  million and million to our pension plan during the years ended december   and  respectively 
we anticipate contributing approximately million to our pension plan in 
table of contents pension plan assumptions weighted average assumptions used to estimate our pension benefit obligations and to determine our net periodic pension benefit cost are as follows year ended december  discount rate used to estimate our pension benefit obligation discount rate used to determine net periodic pension benefit rate of compensation increase n a expected long term rate of return on plan assets we used the citigroup pension discount curve to aid in the selection of our discount rate  which we believe reflects the weighted rate of a theoretical high quality bond portfolio consistent with the duration of the cash flows related to our pension liability 
we considered the current levels of expected returns on a risk free investment  the historical levels of risk premium associated with each of our pension asset classes  the expected future returns for each of our pension asset classes and then weighted each asset class based on our pension plan asset allocation to derive an expected long term return on pension plan assets 
during the year ended december   our actual rate of return on plan assets was 
as a result of the plan freeze during  we have no further service cost or amortization of prior service cost related to the plan 
in addition  because the plan is now frozen and participants became inactive during  the net losses related to the plan included in accumulated other comprehensive income will now be amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants instead of the average remaining service period 
for these reasons  we expect to record a pension benefit of approximately thousand in for every change in the actual return compared to the expected long term return on pension plan assets and for every change in the actual discount rate compared to the discount rate assumption for  our pension expense would change by less than million 
our investment objective is to achieve a consistent total rate of return that will equal or exceed our actuarial assumptions and to equal or exceed the benchmarks that we use for each of our pension plan asset class 
the following asset allocation is designed to create a diversified portfolio of pension plan assets that is consistent with our target asset allocation and risk policy target allocation percentage of plan assets at december  asset category equity securities debt securities recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  there were amendments to the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
these amendments modify step one of the goodwill impairment test  requiring units with zero or negative carrying amounts to perform step two of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
the amendments are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  we adopted this 
table of contents guidance effective january   and do not expect the adoption to have an impact on our interim or annual impairment tests of goodwill 
in october  there were revisions to the accounting standard for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the revisions address how to separate deliverables and how to measure and allocate arrangement consideration to one or more units of accounting 
the revisions are effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  we adopted this guidance effective january   and the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
results of operations set forth below are the key operating areas that contributed to our results for the years ended december   and our consolidated financial statements reflect the operations of the banks broadcasting joint venture station as discontinued for all periods presented

net revenues during the year ended december  increased by million when compared with the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to i an increase in political advertising sales of million  ii an increase in national advertising sales of million  iii an increase in digital revenues of million  iv an increase in local advertising sales of million  and v an increase in other revenues of million 
these increases were partially offset by an increase in agency commissions of million 
the increase in local and national advertising sales during is primarily due to economic recovery compared to the prior year  which resulted in increased advertising spending in our markets 
the automotive category  which represented of our local and national advertising sales for  increased by compared to  when the automotive category represented of our local and national advertising sales 
the increase in political revenues during the year ended december   compared to the prior year  is primarily the result of congressional  state and local elections which take place in even numbered years as well as growth in issue advertising compared to the same period in the increase in digital revenues for the year ended december   compared to the prior year  is due to incremental revenues from the acquisition of rmm in october  growth in internet advertising revenues resulting from increased traffic to our web sites  and growth in retransmission consent revenues as a result of contractual rate increases in per subscriber fees and an increase in subscriber levels compared to net revenues during the year ended december  decreased by million when compared with the prior year

these decreases were partially offset by i an increase in digital revenue of million  and ii a decrease in agency commissions of million 
the decrease in local and national advertising sales during is primarily due to the economic downturn that broadly impacted demand for advertising 
the decrease in political advertising sales during the year ended december   compared to the prior year  is a result of the presidential  congressional  state and local elections in that did not recur in the increase in digital revenues for the year ended december   compared to the prior year  is primarily due to new retransmission consent agreements reached with cable operators during the second half of  and an increase in internet revenues

because of uncertainty surrounding the joint venture ability to repay any shortfall loans  we concluded the million loan was fully impaired during additionally  beginning in  we no longer recognized our approximate share of the joint venture net loss because the investment was fully impaired during the year ended december   accordingly  we suspended recognition of equity method gains and losses 
loss gain on derivative instruments was a loss of million for the year ended december  and a gain of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
during and  our derivative instrument consisted of an interest rate hedge agreement entered into during the second quarter of interest rate hedge to hedge the variability in cash flows associated with notional amount of the declining balances of our term loans  which effectively converted the floating rate libor based payments under this portion of the facility to fixed payments 
we have historically designated the interest rate hedge as a cash flow hedge  and therefore  changes in the value of this agreement were recorded in other comprehensive loss and released into 
table of contents earnings over the life of the agreement through periodic interest payments  and the ineffective portion of the hedge was recorded in earnings 
however  as a result of the april  repayment of million of principal on our term loans  as described further in liquidity and capital resources  the interest rate hedge ceased to be highly effective in hedging the variable rate cash flows associated with our term loans 
accordingly  the portion of the fair value recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss  million  was recorded as a charge to our consolidated statement of operations during the year ended december  additionally  because the hedge ceased to be highly effective in hedging the variable rate cash flows  all changes in fair value are now recorded in our consolidated statement of operations 
we therefore recorded a total loss on derivative instruments of million  including the million charge from accumulated other comprehensive income  for the year ended december  the gain of million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively  is due to fluctuations in market interest rates and in  includes a gain of approximately million recorded for the remaining fair value of the embedded derivatives associated with our exchangeable senior subordinated debentures that we purchased during loss gain on extinguishment of debt was a loss of million for the year ended december  and a gain of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the change in both the years ended december  and was primarily due to a gain of million recorded in related to the purchase of our senior subordinated notes as further described in description of indebtedness 
additionally  during the year ended december   we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of million for the write off of deferred financing fees as a result of the payment of principal on our revolving credit facility and term loans as further described in liquidity and capital resources 
income taxes reflected a provision for benefit from income tax of million  million  and million for the years ended in december    and  respectively 
in  we recorded an impairment charge of billion related to our broadcast licenses and goodwill 
our impairment charge also includes an million charge for the write off of certain broadcast assets that became obsolete as a result of the dtv transition 
our recorded provision for income tax of million for the year ended december  represents an effective tax rate of compared to a provision for income tax of million for the year ended december   which represents an effective tax rate of 
the decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the one time impact of various state law changes that occurred in the increase in the effective tax rate  as compared to  is primarily due to the impact of various state law changes that occurred during additionally  in  our effective tax rate was impacted by the change in our valuation allowance of million 
this amount was primarily attributable to our to net operating losses that more likely than not will not be utilized because of the expiration of the carryforward statute of limitations period

the following table presents summarized information for the operations of the banks broadcasting joint venture station that was previously included in our historical operating results in thousands year ended december  net revenues operating loss income net loss income liquidity and capital resources our liquidity position depends on our ability to generate cash from operations and from borrowings under our senior secured credit facility 
during and over the next twelve months  our liquidity position has been affected by  and will primarily be affected by  among other things  the following repayment and expiration of our senior secured credit facility 
following the delivery of our year end financial statements  our credit agreement requires mandatory prepayments of principal of the term loans  as well as a permanent reduction in revolving credit commitments  based on a computation of excess cash flow for the preceding fiscal year 
pursuant to the computation of excess cash flow for  we also expect to make an estimated million mandatory principal payment  and our revolving credit commitments will decrease from million to approximately million 
further  our senior secured credit facility matures on november   at which time the remaining balance of our term loan must be repaid in full  and our revolving credit facility will expire 
while we intend to enter into a new credit facility prior to november   if we are unable to do so  the expiration of our current revolving credit facility will result in a substantial decrease in our available liquidity 
further  current conditions in the capital markets may impact our ability to enter into a new credit facility on terms similar to our existing agreement 
economic uncertainty 
operating cash flow during will be impacted by the extent to which our local markets and the united states overall experience continued economic recovery during local advertising revenues increased for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   and national advertising revenues increased for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  approximately and of our net revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively  were derived from local and national advertising 
we anticipate further modest economic recovery during  but there can be no assurance that this will occur 
the seasonality of the broadcast business 
because political advertising revenues are greater in even years  we will experience decreased political advertising revenues in political advertising revenues were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
prepayments under our revolving credit facility 
as a result of the increase in operating cash flows during  we made optional prepayments under our revolving credit facility of million  net of borrowings  during the twelve months ended december   resulting in an increase in the available capacity of our revolving credit facility from million as of december   to million as of december  
table of contents other prepayment and repayment of debt obligations 
as further described below in description of indebtedness  on april  we completed an offering of our senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of million  and used the proceeds of such offering to repay amounts outstanding under our senior secured credit facility 
in connection with the offering  we made a mandatory prepayment of principal of million and million on our revolving credit loans and our term loans  plus accrued interest  respectively  which resulted in a reduction of our revolving credit commitments  from million to million 
further  as a result of the million repayment of principal on our term loans  the mandatory annual principal amortization of term loans was reduced from million to million 
employee benefit contributions 
we contributed million to our pension plan during and anticipate contributing million to our pension plan during effective january   we resumed contributions to the k plan  whereby we provide a non elective contribution to all eligible employees 
we contributed approximately million during and expect to contribute approximately million to our k plan during cash requirements related to the nbcuniversal joint venture our joint venture with nbcuniversal has been adversely impacted by the economic downturn 
the joint venture distributed no cash to nbcuniversal and us during the years ended december  and although the joint venture distributed cash to nbcuniversal and us in the amount of million for the year ended december   the cash distributions during included nonrecurring cash proceeds of million from the sale of broadcast towers 
in light of the adverse effect of the economic downturn on the joint venture operating results  in each of the years and respectively  we entered into the original shortfall funding agreement and the shortfall funding agreement with nbcuniversal  which provided that i we and nbcuniversal waived the requirement that the joint venture maintain debt service reserve cash balances of at least million  ii the joint venture would use a portion of its existing debt service reserve cash balances to fund interest payments on the gecc note in and  iii nbcuniversal agreed to defer its receipt of   and management fees  and iv we agreed that if the joint venture does not have sufficient cash to fund interest payments on the gecc note through april   we and nbcuniversal would each provide the joint venture with a shortfall loan on the basis of our percentage of economic interest in the joint venture 
during the year ended december   pursuant to the shortfall funding agreements with nbcuniversal  we made shortfall loans in the aggregate principal amount of million to our joint venture  representing our approximate share in cumulative debt service shortfalls at the joint venture 
concurrent with our funding of the shortfall loans  nbcuniversal funded shortfall loans in the aggregate principal amounts of million to the joint venture  in respect of its approximate share in the cumulative debt service shortfalls at the joint venture 
because of anticipated future cash shortfalls at the joint venture  on march   we and ge entered into the shortfall funding agreement covering the period from april  through april  under the terms of the shortfall funding agreement  we agreed that if the joint venture does not have sufficient cash to fund interest payments on the gecc note through april   we and ge would each provide the joint venture with a shortfall loan 
any shortfall loans funded by us under the shortfall funding agreement will be calculated on the basis of our percentage of economic interest in the joint venture  and ge share of shortfall loans will be calculated on the basis of nbcuniversal percentage of economic interest in the joint venture 
ge obligation to fund shortfall loans under the shortfall funding agreement is conditioned upon a amendment of the joint venture credit agreement with gecc and the llc agreement governing the joint venture operations  to permit the joint venture to obtain shortfall loans from ge  and b receipt of the consent of comcast 
table of contents corporation to the terms and conditions on which ge provides its proportionate share of any shortfall  provided that comcast consent may not be unreasonably withheld 
nbcuniversal has acknowledged and agreed to the terms of the shortfall funding agreement 
under the terms of the joint venture tv master service agreement with nbcuniversal  management fees incurred by the joint venture to nbcuniversal during the term of the shortfall funding agreement will continue to accrue  but are not payable if any existing joint venture shortfall loans remain outstanding 
management fees payable in arrears attributable to   and are also not payable to nbcuniversal if any existing joint venture shortfall loans remain outstanding 
we recognize shortfall funding liabilities to the joint venture on our balance sheet when those liabilities become both probable and estimable  which occurs when joint venture management provides us with budget or forecast information of operating cash flows and working capital needs indicating that a debt service shortfall is probable to occur and when we have reached or intend to reach a shortfall funding agreement covering the budgeted or forecasted period 
based on forecast information provided by joint venture management and our estimate of joint venture cash flows through march   we estimate our share of shortfall funding could be approximately million through march  actual cash shortfalls at the joint venture could vary from our current estimates 
cash shortfalls at the joint venture beyond march  are not currently estimable or probable  therefore  we have not accrued for any potential obligations beyond million 
our ability to honor our shortfall loan obligations under the shortfall funding agreements is limited by certain covenants contained in our amended credit agreement and the indentures governing our senior notes and our senior subordinated notes 
based on the budget provided by joint venture management  and our forecast of total leverage and consolidated ebitda during and  we expect to have the capacity within these restrictions to provide shortfall funding under shortfall funding agreements in proportion to our approximate economic interest in the joint venture through the april  expiration of the shortfall funding agreement 
however  there can be no assurance that we will have the capacity to provide such funding 
if we are unable to make payments under the shortfall funding agreements  the joint venture may be unable to fund interest obligations under the gecc note  resulting in an event of default 
in addition  if the joint venture experiences further cash shortfalls beyond april   we may decide to fund such cash shortfalls  or to fund such shortfalls through further loans or equity contributions to the joint venture 
an event of default under the gecc note will occur if the joint venture fails to make any scheduled interest payment within days of the date due and payable  or to pay the principal amount on the maturity date 
if the joint venture fails to pay interest on the gecc note  and no shortfall loan to fund the interest payment is made within days of the date due and payable  an event of default would occur and gecc could accelerate the maturity of the entire amount due under the gecc note 
other than the acceleration of the principal amount upon an event of default  prepayment of the principal of the note is prohibited unless agreed upon by both nbcuniversal and us 
upon an event of default under the gecc note  gecc only recourse is to the joint venture  our equity interest in the joint venture and  after exhausting all remedies against the assets of the joint venture and the other equity interests in the joint venture  to lin tv pursuant to its guarantee of the gecc note 
under the terms of its guarantee of the gecc note  lin tv would be required to make a payment for an amount to be determined upon occurrence of the following events i there is an event of default  ii the default is not remedied  and iii after gecc exhausts all remedies against the assets of the joint venture  the total amount realized upon exercise of those remedies is less than the million principal amount of the gecc note 
upon the occurrence of such events  the amount owed by lin tv to gecc pursuant to the guarantee would be calculated as the difference between i the total amount at which the joint venture assets were sold and ii the principal amount and any unpaid interest due under the gecc note 
as of december   we estimate the fair value of the television stations in the joint 
table of contents venture to be approximately million less than the outstanding balance of the gecc note of million 
although we believe the probability is remote that there would be an event of default and therefore an acceleration of the principal amount of the gecc note during  there can be no assurances that such an event of default will not occur 
there are no financial or similar covenants in the gecc note 
in addition  since both nbcuniversal and lin television have agreed to fund interest payments through april   and ge and lin television have agreed to fund interest payments from april  through april   if the joint venture is unable to generate sufficient cash to service interest payments on the gecc note  nbcuniversal or ge  and lin television are able to control the occurrence of a default under the gecc note 
we believe that our cash flows from current operations  together with cash on hand  and available borrowings will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements through the november  expiration of our senior secured credit facility 
beyond the expiration of our senior secured credit facility  we believe that our cash flows from operations  and cash on hand  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements  without the need for additional borrowings  through at least march  these cash requirements include working capital  capital expenditures  interest payments  scheduled principal payments  our acquisition of wcwf tv and certain assets of wbdt tv  and loans to our joint venture with nbcuniversal pursuant to the shortfall funding agreements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to interest rates on our senior secured credit facility debt 
we use derivative financial instruments to mitigate our exposure to market risks from fluctuations in interest rates 
in accordance with our policy  we do not enter into derivative instruments unless there is an underlying exposure  and we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes 
interest rate risk our total debt as of december  was million  including current portion of million  of which the senior notes and senior subordinated notes bear a fixed interest rate and the credit facility bears an interest rate based on  at our option  either a the libor interest rate  or b the abr rate  which is an interest rate that is equal to the greatest of i the prime rate  ii the federal funds effective rate plus of percent  and iii the one month libor rate plus 
in addition  the rate we select also bears an applicable margin rate of or for libor based loans and abr rate loans  respectively 
accordingly  we are exposed to potential losses related to increases in interest rates 
the outstanding balance on our senior secured credit facility was million as of december  and consisted entirely of our remaining term loan balance  which is hedged by the interest rate swap agreement as described below 
therefore  a hypothetical increase in the floating rate used as the basis for the interest charged on the senior secured credit facility as of december  would not impact our annualized interest expense assuming a constant balance outstanding of million 
during the second quarter of  we entered into a contract to hedge a notional amount of the declining balances of our term loans to mitigate changes in our cash flows resulting from fluctuations in interest rates 
the interest rate hedge effectively converted the floating libor rate based payments to fixed payments at plus the applicable margin rate calculated under our senior secured credit facility  which expires in november we have historically designated the interest rate hedge as a cash flow hedge 
however  as a result of the april  repayment of million of principal on our term loans  as described further in the liquidity and capital resources section under item management discussion and analysis  the interest rate hedge ceased to be highly effective in hedging the variable rate cash flows associated with our term loans 
accordingly  the portion of the fair value recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss  million  was recorded as a charge to our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  additionally  because the hedge ceased to be highly effective in hedging the variable rate cash flows  all changes in fair value are now recorded to our consolidated statement of operations 
we therefore recorded a loss on derivative instruments of million  including the million charge from accumulated other comprehensive loss  for the year ended december   respectively
