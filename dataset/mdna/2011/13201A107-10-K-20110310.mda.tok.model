this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and the notes thereto included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  organization of information this section includes the following sections overview results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  year ended december  compared to year ended december  liquidity and capital resources non gaap measures capital expenditures and outlook commitments and contractual obligations off balance sheet arrangements critical accounting policies and estimates recently issued financial accounting standards overview on december   we completed the business combination of cambium and vlcy as contemplated by the agreement and plan of mergers  dated as of june   among us  vlcy  vowel acquisition corp  our wholly owned subsidiary  cambium  a wholly owned subsidiary of vss cambium holdings iii  llc  consonant acquisition corp  our wholly owned subsidiary  and vowel representative  llc  solely in its capacity as stockholders representative 
we refer to this agreement and plan of mergers in this report as the merger agreement 
pursuant to the merger agreement  we acquired all of the common stock of each of cambium and vlcy through the merger of consonant acquisition corp 
with and into cambium  with cambium continuing as the surviving corporation the cambium merger  and the concurrent merger of vowel acquisition corp 
with and into vlcy  with vlcy continuing as the surviving corporation the voyager merger 
as a result of the effectiveness of the mergers  cambium and vlcy became our wholly owned subsidiaries 
under the terms of the merger agreement  each outstanding share of vlcy s common stock was converted in the voyager merger into the right to receive at the election of each stockholder  either i in cash  without interest  or ii one share of our common stock  plus  regardless of the election made  additional consideration consisting of cash and a contingent value right  as described in the merger agreement 
the amount of cash available to satisfy cash elections by the vlcy stockholders was limited to million in the aggregate 
the cash consideration payable to the former vlcy stockholders was insufficient to accommodate all of the cash elections that were made 
accordingly  the amount of cash paid to the former vlcy stockholders who elected to exchange shares of vlcy common stock for cash was reduced  pro rata  in accordance with agreed procedures set forth in the merger agreement 
pursuant to these procedures  we paid million in cash to the former holders of vlcy s common stock and issued to those stockholders a total of million shares of common stock 
the cash consideration paid to the former vlcy stockholders consisted of million contributed by vss cambium holdings iii  llc and million contributed by vlcy 
in exchange for its contribution of million  vss cambium holdings iii  llc received million shares of our common stock issued at the ascribed value of per share 
the shares of cambium s common stock held by vss cambium holdings iii  llc  its sole stockholder  were converted in the cambium merger into the right to receive million shares of the our common stock 
in addition  as part of the merger consideration  vss cambium holdings iii  llc received a warrant to purchase a number of shares of our common stock determined by a formula set forth in the merger agreement  which is currently equal to million shares 
in connection with the consummation of this transaction we entered into a stockholders agreement pursuant to which we granted vss cambium holdings iii  llc and funds managed and controlled by vss the right to purchase up to million shares of our common stock as provided for in the stockholders agreement as well as certain preemptive rights set forth therein 

table of contents the merger transaction was accounted for as an acquisition of vlcy by cambium  as that term is used under us gaap  for accounting and financial reporting purposes under the applicable accounting guidance for business combinations 
in making this determination  management considered that a the newly developed entity did not have any significant pre combination activity and  therefore  did not qualify to be the accounting acquirer  and b the former sole stockholder of cambium is the majority holder of the combined entity  while the prior owners of vlcy became minority holders in the combined entity 
as a result  the historical financial statements of cambium have become the historical financial statements of the company 
the results of vlcy are included in the company s operations beginning with the december  merger date  therefore  the financials include vlcy for the last days of that year and the results of the company for the full year 
prior to the merger transaction completed on december   we had two reportable segments published products and learning technologies 
subsequent to the merger transaction  we operate as three reportable segments with separate management teams and infrastructures that offer various products and services  as follows voyager  our comprehensive intervention business  sopris  our supplemental solutions education business  and cambium learning technologies  our technology based education product business 
unallocated shared services  such as accounting  legal  human resources and corporate related items  are recorded in a shared services category 
depreciation and amortization expense  interest income and expense  other income and expense  and taxes are included in this category 
our historical segment reporting results have been adjusted for comparative purposes to reflect the current organizational structure 
these reclassifications required certain assumptions and estimates 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our reportable segments 
also  as a result of the merger transaction and change in segments  we made a number of changes to personnel and processes as part of an overall departmental restructuring 
as certain functions were consolidated  some resources were shifted to other areas of the business 
in particular  some general and administrative functions were merged and  where appropriate  certain resources were shifted to customer facing functions  which are classified as cost of revenues 
these changes may affect comparability of pre merger and post merger periods 
results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year highlights during  we continued to experience adverse conditions in the education funding environment  including the elimination of reading first funding and the continued depressed circumstance of certain state and local budgets 
as school districts rely upon state and local budgets  some of our customers have found it more challenging to secure alternative funding sources in the midst of these market conditions 
additionally  potential customers are more frequently utilizing a request for proposal process to complete purchases  which elongates the time required to complete a sale 
we have experienced some positive impact  both directly and indirectly  from the arra passed in february the arra provides significant new federal funding for various education initiatives through september while the education funding is for a broad set of education initiatives  we believe that schools and districts have directed  and may continue to direct  some of the new funding for programs which use our products 
in some instances  if arra funding is not used directly for programs using our products  we may still be receiving an indirect benefit 
when the arra funding is used to assist schools to meet their overall financial needs  other funds may be freed up to use for our programs 
in and we have had success in securing orders which we believe are directly funded by arra funds 
we believe that we received more directly funded arra purchases in versus this increase allowed us to partially offset a decline in order volume we experienced due to the end of reading first funding in order volume is an internal metric of shipments of our products and orders for online subscriptions and it serves as a leading indicator of net revenues 

table of contents the following trends have had or may have an impact on our net revenues  profitability and ebitda declines have been realized in our internal order volume metric due to the elimination of the reading first program and the economic crisis faced by many states and local entities 
to some extent  we expect the crisis will continue throughout the following quarters and have a continued depressive effect on general spending and therefore make order volume growth challenging 
the stimulus funds drove several large multi year deals in and which helped offset the wind down of reading first 
we expect continued growth in our online subscription based products 
we have experienced success growing our portfolio to address the math needs of the market  including products such as vmath  transitional math and gizmos explorelearning 
while the gizmos products have continued strong growth in  our other math based products have been flat 
we expect that the market for these products will continue to be strong and will return to growth in the future 
we believe our product diversification will strengthen our ability to sustain market share in a troubled market and capture market share when the market recovers 
we believe our focus on student outcomes through product usage and an overall partnership approach with the customer to implement our solutions  in the manner that the program was designed  results in higher student success rates  and such success  if achieved  will lead to customer retention and growth through reference sales 
we believe there is a trend of student accountability resulting in greater funding being directed to at risk children in the united states with new funding sources  such as race to the top  which could provide additional funds for our products 
successful efforts to reduce the company s cost structure were undertaken in by both vlcy and cambium  to better align our cost structure to current market conditions 
in  we achieved significant cost savings as part of an effort to achieve merger related synergies  which included a reduction in force 
the company will continue to seek ways to operate more efficiently  but the magnitude of the reductions in and are not expected to be replicated 
we invested in several key areas in these are improved student data management systems  a separate dedicated sales force and development of an ecommerce engine for sopris and continued investment in clt  primarily in product development  sales and marketing 
we expect to benefit from continuity of our leadership team and sales organization  who have now worked together for more than a year

as a result of the signing of the merger agreement  we assessed the carrying values of our reporting units as of june  the first step of impairment testing showed that the carrying value of our published products segment exceeded its fair value and that a step two analysis was needed 
step two impairment testing determined that the goodwill balance as of the measurement date was partially impaired and a million impairment charge was recorded

the total settlement consisted of million in escrowed funds  together with additional payments of million and interest income of million 
the total settlement amount of million was used to cover costs and to pay down a portion of a senior secured credit facility 
because the embezzlement was discovered after the initial purchase allocation was made in connection with the acquisition of cambium learning  the entire settlement amount was recorded on our consolidated statement of operations as a gain from settlement with the previous stockholders 
loss on extinguishment of debt for fiscal  we recorded a loss on the extinguishment of debt of million related to the modification of our senior secured credit facility and senior unsecured promissory notes resulting from the execution of an amendment of those documents and the delivery by the lenders of a permanent waiver 
the associated unamortized deferred financing costs as of august  of million and amendment fees of million related to the permanent waiver were recorded as a loss on extinguishment of debt 
liquidity and capital resources because sales seasonality affects operating cash flow  we normally incur a net cash deficit from all of our activities through the early part of the third quarter of the year 
we typically fund these seasonal deficits through the drawdown of cash  supplemented by borrowings on a revolving credit facility 
the primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations and the primary liquidity requirements relate to debt service  pre publication costs  capital investments and working capital 
we believe that based on current and anticipated levels of operating performances  cash flow from operations and availability under a revolving credit facility  we will be able to make required interest payments on our debt and fund our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next months

non gaap measures our historical financial statements presented in accordance with gaap include vlcy results only for the periods subsequent to the december  acquisition date 
further  the net losses for both the company and vlcy as reported on a gaap basis include material non recurring and non operational items 
we believe that earnings loss from operations before interest and other income expense  income taxes  and depreciation and amortization  or ebitda  and adjusted ebitda  which further excludes non recurring and non operational items  provide useful information for investors to assess the results of the ongoing business of the combined company 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not prepared in accordance with gaap and may be different from similarly named  non gaap financial measures used by other companies 
non gaap financial measures should not be considered a substitute for  or superior to  measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap 
we believe that adjusted ebitda provides useful information to investors because it reflects the underlying performance of the ongoing operations of the combined company and provides investors with a view of the combined company s operations from management s perspective 
adjusted ebitda removes significant one time or certain non cash items from earnings 
we use adjusted ebitda to monitor and evaluate the operating performance of the combined company and as the basis to set and measure progress towards performance targets  which directly affect compensation for employees and executives 
we generally use these non gaap measures as measures of operating performance and not as measures of liquidity 
our presentation of ebitda and adjusted ebitda should not be construed as an indication that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items

partially offsetting this impact  cost of revenues and sales and marketing expenses were reduced for other purchase accounting adjustments  primarily a write down of deferred costs to zero at the acquisition date 
during the years ended december   and december   the historical cost of revenues was reduced by million and million  respectively  and the historical sales and marketing expenses were reduced by million and million  respectively  and the related pro forma adjustments reflect the impact of the write down assuming the merger occurred on january  the adjustment of deferred revenue and deferred costs to fair value is required only at the purchase accounting date  therefore  its impact on net revenues  cost of revenues  and sales and marketing expense is non recurring

revenue recognition 
in october  new guidance was issued regarding multiple deliverable revenue arrangements and certain arrangements that include software elements 
this guidance requires entities to allocate revenue in an arrangement using estimated selling prices of the delivered goods and services based on a selling price hierarchy 
the guidance eliminates the residual method of revenue allocation and requires revenue to be allocated using the relative selling price method 
in addition to requiring that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of an arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method  the guidance establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable  which includes vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  if available  third party evidence tpe  if vendor specific objective evidence is not available  and best estimate of selling price besp  if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
the objective of besp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand alone basis 
it also removes tangible products from the scope of software revenue guidance and provides guidance on determining whether software deliverables in an arrangement that includes a tangible product are covered by the scope of the software revenue guidance 
this guidance must be applied on a prospective basis for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june   with early adoption permitted 
effective january   we adopted this guidance on a prospective basis for all new or materially modified arrangements entered into after the adoption date 
revenues are derived from sales of reading  math and science  and professional development solutions to school districts primarily in the united states 
sales include printed materials and often online access to educational materials for individual students  teachers  and classrooms 
revenue from the sale of printed materials for reading and math products is recognized when the product is shipped to or received by the customer  depending on the shipping terms of the arrangement 
revenue for product support  training and implementation services  and online subscriptions is recognized over the period services are delivered 
revenue for the online content sold separately or included with certain curriculum materials is recognized ratably over the subscription period  typically a school year 
revenue for our professional development courses  which can include an internet delivery component  is recognized over the contractual delivery period 
explorelearning and learning a z derive revenue exclusively from sales of online subscriptions to their reading  math and science teaching websites and related training and professional development 
typically  the subscriptions are for a twelve to twenty four month period and the revenue is recognized ratably over the period the online access is available to the customer 
the division of revenue between shipped materials  online materials  and ongoing support and services was determined in accordance with the new accounting guidance for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we are not able to establish vsoe for each of our deliverables 
whenever vsoe cannot be established  we review the offerings of our competitors to determine whether tpe can be established 
tpe is determined based on the prices charged by our competitors for a similar deliverable when sold separately 
it may be difficult for us to obtain sufficient information on competitor pricing to substantiate tpe and therefore we may not always be able to use tpe 
we also use besp to determine the selling price of certain of deliverables 
besp was primarily used for the printed materials for product lines acquired in the vlcy acquisition  which have historically been priced on a bundled basis with the related online materials 
our determination of besp considers the anticipated margin on that deliverable  the selling price and profit margin for similar parts or services  and our ongoing pricing strategy and policies 
we plan to analyze the selling prices used in the allocation of arrangement consideration at least annually 
selling prices will be analyzed on a more frequent basis if a significant change in our business necessitates a more timely analysis or if we experience significant variances in our selling prices 

table of contents our software products often include maintenance  support or on line services 
maintenance and support services include telephone support  bug fixes  and  for certain products  rights to upgrades and enhancements on a when and if available basis 
on line services include storage  assignment  scoring and reporting 
these services are recognized on a straight line basis over the period they are provided 
revenues under multiple element software license arrangements  which may include several different software products and services sold together  are allocated to each element based on the residual method in accordance with accounting guidance for software revenue recognition 
in certain instances  telephone support and software repairs are provided for free within the first year of licensing the software 
the cost of providing this service is insignificant  and is accrued at the time of revenue recognition 
we enter into agreements to license certain publishing rights and content 
we recognize the revenue from these agreements when the license amount is fixed and determinable  collection is reasonably assured  and the license period has commenced 
for those license agreements that require us to deliver additional materials as part of the license agreement  the revenue is recognized when the product is received by the customer 
shipments to school book depositories are on consignment and revenue is recognized based on shipments from the depositories to the schools 
impairment of goodwill 
we review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment at least annually 
the annual analysis is performed as of december or when certain triggering events occur 
the applicable accounting guidance requires that a two step impairment test be performed on goodwill 
in the first step  the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of that unit  goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is required 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of that unit  then a second step must be performed to determine the implied fair value of the reporting entity s goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then an impairment loss equal to the difference is recorded 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature  and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions may include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates  future economic and market conditions  and determination of appropriate market comparables 
in addition  we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values of our reporting units 
we performed the yearend impairment analysis using four reporting units voyager  sopris  the learning a z and explorelearning subscription businesses from the clt segment lazel  and the kurzweil and intellitools businesses from the clt segment ki 
the following table details the goodwill balance by reporting unit at december  goodwill balance as of december  voyager sopris lazel ki total in the first step of the impairment test for fiscal year  the fair market value of each reporting unit was determined using an income approach and was dependent on multiple assumptions and estimates  including future cash flow projections with a terminal value multiple and the discount rate used to determine the expected present value of the estimated future cash flows 
future cash flow projections were based on management s best estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period  including industry fundamentals such as the state of educational funding  revenue growth rates  future costs and operating margins  working capital needs  capital and other expenditures  and tax rates 
the discount rate applied to the future cash flows was a weighted average cost of capital and took into consideration market and industry conditions  returns for comparable companies  the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn  and other relevant factors 
the first step of impairment testing for fiscal showed that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by at least  therefore  no second step of testing was required 
the adverse developments in the education funding environment that affected our operations during fiscal year and may continue to have an impact  and potentially increase the impact  on our future revenues  profits  cash flows and carrying value of assets 
although management has included its best estimates of the impact of these and other factors in our cash flow projections  the projection of future cash flows is inherently uncertain and requires a significant amount of judgment 
actual results that are significantly different than these cash flow projections or a change in the discount rate could significantly affect the fair value estimates used to value our reporting units in step one of the goodwill analysis or the fair values of our other asset and liability balances used in step two of the goodwill analysis  and could result in future goodwill impairments 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets 
we review the carrying value of long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate net book value may not be recoverable from the estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
if our review indicates any assets are impaired  the impairment of those assets is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value as estimated by discounted cash flows 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost of disposal 
for fiscal year  no impairment was indicated 
the determination whether our definite lived intangible assets are impaired involves significant assumptions and estimates  including projections of future cash flows  the percentage of future revenues and cash flows attributable to the intangible assets  asset lives used to generate future cash flows  and royalty charges attributable to trademarks 
the impairment calculations are most sensitive to the future cash flow assumptions 
future cash flow projections are based on management s best estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period  including industry fundamentals such as the state of educational funding  revenue growth rates  future costs and operating margins  working capital needs  and capital and other expenditures 
adverse developments in the education funding environment  including the reductions in available state and local funds as property taxes decline  have affected our operations during and may continue to have an impact  and potentially increase the impact  on our future revenues  profits  cash flows and carrying value of assets 
pre publication costs 
we capitalize certain pre publication costs of our curriculum  including art  prepress  editorial  and other costs incurred in the creation of the master copy of our curriculum products 
pre publication costs are amortized over the expected life of the education program  generally on an accelerated basis over a period of five years 
the amortization methods and periods chosen reflect the expected revenues generated by the education programs 
we periodically review the recoverability of the capitalized costs based on expected net realizable value 
accounts receivable 
accounts receivable are stated net of allowances for doubtful accounts and estimated sales returns 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on a review of the outstanding balances and historical collection experience 
the reserve for sales returns is based on historical rates of returns as well as other factors that in our judgment could reasonably be expected to cause sales returns to differ from historical experience 
actual bad debt write offs and returns could differ from our estimates 
inventory 
inventory is stated at the lower of cost  determined using the first in  first out fifo method  or market  and consists of finished goods 
we reduce slow moving or obsolete inventory to net realizable value 
inventory values are maintained at an amount that management considers appropriate based on factors such as the inventory aging  historical usage of the product  future sales forecasts  and product development plans 
these factors involve management s judgment and changes in estimates could result in increases or decreases to the inventory values 
inventory values are reviewed on a periodic basis 
income taxes 
provision is made for the expense  or benefit  associated with taxes based on income 
the provision for income taxes is based on laws currently enacted in every jurisdiction in which we do business and considers laws mitigating the taxation of the same income by more than one jurisdiction 
significant judgment is required in determining income tax expense  current tax receivables and payables  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and valuation allowance recorded against the net deferred tax assets 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  taxable income in prior carryback years  loss carryforward limitations  and tax planning strategies in assessing whether deferred tax assets will be realized in future periods 
if  after consideration of these factors  management believes it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized  a valuation allowance is established 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable could be reduced if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced 
we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two step process 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit 
the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate these amounts  since this requires management to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
we reevaluate our uncertain tax positions on a periodic basis  based on factors such as changes in facts and circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity 
contingent value rights cvrs 
cvrs were issued to vlcy stockholders as part of the merger 
each cvr represents the right to receive a cash amount equal to the sum of the following amounts minus specified agreed upon liabilities  including agreed contingencies  potential working capital adjustments and expenses of the stockholders representative under the merger agreement specified vlcy tax refunds received after the effective time of the merger  plus the lesser of million or the amount of specified post signing tax refunds of vlcy received after the date of the merger agreement and on or prior to the date of the closing  which was million  plus 
table of contents a portion of funds held for a potential tax indemnity obligation  if such obligation is not paid to its beneficiary  plus other amounts specified in the escrow agreement  divided by the total number of shares of vlcy common stock outstanding as of the effective time of the merger 
the first cvr payment date was in september and million was distributed to the escrow agent at that time for distribution to holders of the cvrs 
a second cvr distribution will be made in june and the final distribution  if any  with respect to a potential tax indemnity obligation will be in october additionally  as described in other contingencies below  any amounts due to cvr holders as a result of refunds received related to the michigan tax payment will be distributed upon the final resolution of this agreed contingency 
the fair value of the liability for the cvrs is determined using a probability weighted cash flow analysis which takes into consideration the likelihood  amount and timing of cash flows of each element of the pool of assets and liabilities included in the cvr 
the determination of fair value of the cvrs involves significant assumptions and estimates  which are reviewed at each quarterly reporting date 
as of december   a fair value of million has been recorded as a liability for the remaining cvr payments 
during the year ended december   a gain of million was recorded in general and administrative expense to reflect a decrease in the estimated fair value of the cvr liability 
the ultimate value of the cvrs is not known at this time  however  it is not expected to be more than million and could be as low as the million already distributed 
future changes in the estimate of the fair value of the cvrs will impact results of operations and could be material 
as of december   restricted assets in an escrow account for the benefit of the cvrs were million 
the escrow account includes million for a potential tax indemnity obligation  which  if such obligation is not triggered  will benefit the cvrs by million with the remainder reverting back to the general cash of the company 
further information regarding the fair value of the cvrs is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
other contingencies 
other contingencies are recorded when it is probable that a liability exists and the value can be reasonably estimated 
the company had a potential indemnification liability related to state income taxes and related interest that had been assessed against proquest information and learning pqil 
on august   pqil received a decision and order of determination from the michigan taxing authority 
according to the determination of the michigan taxing authority  pqil was liable to the state of michigan for unpaid taxes and interest in the amount of approximately million 
in order to expedite resolution of this matter and access the michigan court of claims  the company paid this indemnification liability to the state of michigan on behalf of pqil on september  the company has filed an action in the michigan court of claims to pursue a refund of the assessment 
management believes it is more likely than not that the company s position will be upheld in the court of claims and a million tax receivable for the expected refund is recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  this indemnification liability was identified as an agreed contingency for purposes of the cvrs issued as part of the vlcy merger consideration 
in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement  dated june   fifty percent of any amount that is paid or due and payable with respect to each agreed contingency would offset payments due under the cvrs from an amount held for such payments by wells fargo bank  na  as escrow agent  in an escrow account 
upon payment of the approximately million  the company requested a disbursement to the company from the escrow account in an amount equal to fifty percent of the payment  or approximately million 
this cash disbursement was received by the company during the third quarter of on september   the company amended the merger agreement and the escrow agreement to extend the term of the escrow agreement until the later of the full distribution of the escrow funds or the final resolution of the agreed contingency 
the final resolution of the tax litigation or potential settlement could result in a refund ranging from zero to approximately million 
as of december   the fair value of the cvr includes a reduction of approximately million related to this state income tax issue 
this calculated reduction amount uses management assumptions related to the likelihood of any ultimate cash outflows for this agreed upon contingency 
however  the actual impact on the cvr could be up to one half of the million if pqil s position is not ultimately upheld 
additionally  if pqil s position is not ultimately upheld  the company could incur up to million of indemnification expense in future periods on its statements of operations  partially offset by any reduction to the cvrs liability
