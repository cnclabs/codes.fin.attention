cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements this report and documents incorporated by reference into this report contain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of the exchange act  as amended  which are not historical facts but rather are based on current expectations  estimates and projections about our business and industry  our beliefs and assumptions 
words such as believes  anticipates  plans  expects  will  goal  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
the inclusion of forward looking statements should not be regarded as a representation by us that any of our plans will be achieved 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
such forward looking information is also subject to various risks and uncertainties 
such risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  risks arising from our providing services exclusively to the health care industry  primarily providers of long term care  proposed and enacted legislation and or regulations to reform the us healthcare system in an effort to contain healthcare costs  credit and collection risks associated with this industry  one client accounting for approximately of revenues in see notes and  major client in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements  our claims experience related to workers compensation and general liability insurance  the effects of changes in  or interpretations of laws and regulations governing the industry  including state and local regulations pertaining to the taxability of our services  and the risk factors described in part i in this report under government regulation of 
table of contents clients  competition  service agreements collections  and under item ia  risk factors 
many of our clients revenues are highly contingent on medicare and medicaid reimbursement funding rates  which congress has affected through the enactment of a number of major laws during the past decade  most recently the march enactment of the act 
currently  the us congress is considering further changes or revising legislation relating to health care in the united states which  among other initiatives  may impose cost containment measures impacting our clients 
these enacted and proposed laws have significantly altered  or threaten to alter  overall government reimbursement funding rates and mechanisms 
in addition  the current economic crises could adversely affect such funding 
the overall effect of these laws and trends in the long term care industry has affected and could adversely affect the liquidity of our clients  resulting in their inability to make payments to us on agreed upon payment terms 
these factors  in addition to delays in payments from clients  have resulted in  and could continue to result in  significant additional bad debts in the near future 
additionally  our operating results would be adversely affected if unexpected increases in the costs of labor and labor related costs  materials  supplies and equipment used in performing services could not be passed on to our clients 
in addition  we believe that to improve our financial performance we must continue to obtain service agreements with new clients  provide new services to existing clients  achieve modest price increases on current service agreements with existing clients and maintain internal cost reduction strategies at our various operational levels 
furthermore  we believe that our ability to sustain the internal development of managerial personnel is an important factor impacting future operating results and successfully executing projected growth strategies 
results of operations the following discussion is intended to provide the reader with information that will be helpful in understanding our financial statements including the changes in certain key items in comparing financial statements period to period 
we also intend to provide the primary factors that accounted for those changes  as well as a summary of how certain accounting principles affect our financial statements 
in addition  we are providing information about the financial results of our two operating segments to further assist in understanding how these segments and their results affect our consolidated results of operations 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements as of december  and the year then ended and the notes accompanying those financial statements contained herein under item as disclosed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  ces was acquired may  the ces results of operations  for the period may  to december  are included in our consolidated results of operations and financial information presented below 
such impact  when material and quantifiable  is discussed where we believe it would contribute to the reader s understanding of our financial statements 
overview we provide management  administrative and operating expertise and services to the housekeeping  laundry  linen  facility maintenance and dietary service departments of the health care industry  including nursing homes  retirement complexes  rehabilitation centers and hospitals located throughout the united states 
we believe that we are the largest provider of housekeeping and laundry management services to the long term care industry in the united states  rendering such services to approximately  facilities in states as of december  although we do not directly participate in any government reimbursement programs  our clients reimbursements are subject to government regulation 
therefore  they are directly affected by any legislation relating to medicare and medicaid reimbursement programs 

table of contents we provide our services primarily pursuant to full service agreements with our clients 
in such agreements  we are responsible for the day to day management of the department managers and hourly employees located at our clients facilities 
we also provide services on the basis of a management only agreement for a very limited number of clients 
our agreements with clients typically provide for renewable one year service terms  cancelable by either party upon to days notice after the initial day period 
we are organized into two reportable segments  housekeeping  laundry  linen and other services housekeeping  and dietary department services dietary 
at december   housekeeping is being provided at essentially all of our approximately  client facilities  generating approximating or  of total revenues 
dietary is being provided to approximately client facilities at december  and contributed approximately or  of total revenues 
housekeeping consists of the managing of the client s housekeeping department which is principally responsible for the cleaning  disinfecting and sanitizing of patient rooms and common areas of a client s facility  as well as the laundering and processing of the personal clothing belonging to the facility s patients 
also within the scope of this segment s service is the responsibility for laundering and processing of the bed linens  uniforms and other assorted linen items utilized by a client facility 
dietary consists of managing the client s dietary department which is principally responsible for food purchasing  meal preparation and providing dietician consulting professional services  which includes the development of a menu that meets the patient s dietary needs 
our ability to acquire new clients and increase revenues is affected by many factors 
competitive factors consist primarily of competing with the potential client utilizing an in house support staff to provide services similar to ours  as well as local companies which provide services similar to ours 
we do not believe that there are any other companies  on a national or local level  which have a significant presence or impact on our procurement of new clients in our market 
we believe the primary revenue drivers of our business are our ability to obtain new clients and to pass through  by means of service billing increases  increases in our cost of providing the services 
in addition to the recoupment of costs increases  we endeavor to obtain modest annual revenue increases from our existing clients to preserve current profit margins at the facility level 
the primary economic factor in acquiring new clients is our ability to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of our services 
this is because many of our clients revenues are generally highly reliant on medicare and medicaid reimbursement funding rates and mechanisms 
therefore  their economic decision making process in engaging us is driven significantly by their reimbursement funding rate structure in relation to how their costs are currently being reimbursed and the financial impact on their reimbursement as a result of engaging us for the respective services 
another factor is our ability to demonstrate to potential clients the benefit of being relieved of the administrative and operational challenges related to the day to day management of their respective department services for which they contract with us 
in addition  we must be able to assure new clients that we will be able to improve the quality of service which they are providing to their patients and residents 
we believe the factors discussed above are equally applicable to each of our segments with respect to acquiring new clients and increasing revenues 
primarily  our costs of services provided can experience volatility and impact our operating performance in two key cost indicators 
they are costs of labor  and costs of supplies  although the volatility of these costs impacts each segment somewhat differently due to the respective costs as a percentage of that segment s revenues 
housekeeping is more significantly impacted than dietary as a consequence of our management of our costs of labor 
such costs of labor can account for approximately  as a percentage of housekeeping revenues 
dietary costs of labor account for approximately  as a percentage of dietary revenues 
changes in wage rates as a result of legislative or collective bargaining actions  anticipated staffing levels  and other unforeseen variations in our use of labor at a 
table of contents client service location or in management labor costs will result in volatility of these costs 
in contrast  supplies consumed in performing our services is more significant for dietary  accounting for approximately  as a percentage of dietary revenues  of total operating costs incurred at a dietary facility service location 
housekeeping supplies  including linen products  account for approximately  as a percentage of housekeeping revenues  of total operating costs incurred at a housekeeping facility service location 
generally  the volatility of these expenses is influenced by factors outside of our control and is unpredictable 
this is because housekeeping and dietary supplies are principally commodity products and affected by market conditions specific to the respective products 
although we endeavor to pass on such increases in labor and supplies costs to our clients  the inability or delay in procuring service billing increases to reflect these additional costs would negatively impact our profit margins 
as a result of the current economic crisis  many states have significant budget deficits 
state medicaid programs are experiencing increased demand  and with lower revenues than projected  they have fewer resources to support their medicaid programs 
in addition  federal health reform legislation has been enacted that would significantly expand state medicaid programs and their related costs 
as a result  some state medicaid programs are reconsidering previously approved increases in nursing home reimbursement or are considering delaying those increases 
a few states have indicated it is possible they will run out of cash to pay medicaid providers  including nursing homes 
any of these changes would adversely affect the liquidity of our clients  resulting in their inability to make payments to us as agreed upon 
in and  federal economic stimulus legislation was enacted to counter the impact of the economic crisis on state budgets 
the legislation includes the temporary provision of additional federal matching funds to help states maintain their medicaid programs 
the legislation passed in extended the benefits until june  albeit at a reduced reimbursement rate 
it is uncertain whether additional federal funding will be provided in the future or if it will be provided in the form of matching funds 
in addition  certain states have proposed legislation to provide additional funding for nursing home providers 
even if federal or state legislation is enacted that provides additional funding to medicaid providers  given the volatility of the economic environment  it is difficult to predict the impact of this legislation on our clients liquidity and their ability to make payments to us as agreed 
we currently operate one wholly owned subsidiary  huntingdon holdings  inc huntingdon 
huntingdon invests our cash and cash equivalents  as well as managing our portfolio of available for sale marketable securities 
on march   we sold our wholly owned subsidiary hcsg supply  inc supply for approximately  financed principally through our acceptance of a secured promissory note which is recorded in our notes receivable in the accompanying december  and balance sheet 
as a result of the supply sale  we recorded an immaterial gain in our consolidated statements of income 

table of contents consolidated operations the following table sets forth  for the years indicated  the percentage which certain items bear to consolidated revenues relation to consolidated revenues years ended december  revenues operating costs and expenses costs of services provided selling  general and administrative investment and interest income before income taxes income taxes net income subject to the factors noted in the cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements included in this report  we anticipate  although there can be no assurance thereof  our financial performance in may be comparable to the percentages presented in the above table as they relate to consolidated revenues 
housekeeping is our largest and core reportable segment  representing approximately of consolidated revenues 
dietary revenues represented approximately of consolidated revenues 
although there can be no assurance thereof  we believe that in each of housekeeping s and dietary s revenues  as a percentage of consolidated revenues  will remain approximately the same as their respective percentages noted above 
furthermore  we expect the sources of growth in for the respective operating segments will be primarily the same as historically experienced 
accordingly  although there can be no assurance thereof  the growth in dietary is expected to come from our current housekeeping client base  while growth in housekeeping will primarily come from obtaining new clients 
compared with the following table sets forth income statement key components that we use to evaluate our financial performance on a consolidated and reportable segment basis  as well as the percentage increases of each compared to amounts 
the differences between the reportable segments operating results and other disclosed data and our consolidated financial statements relate primarily to corporate level transactions and recording of transactions at the reportable segment level which use methods other than generally accepted accounting principles

we have one client  a nursing home chain major client  which in and accounted for and  respectively  of consolidated revenues 
at both december  and amounts due from such client represented less than of our accounts receivable balance 
although we expect to continue the relationship with this client  there can be no assurance thereof  and the loss of such client  or a significant reduction in the revenues we receive from this client  would have a material adverse effect on the results of operations of our two operating segments 
in addition  if such client changes its payment terms it would increase our accounts receivable balance and have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and cash and cash equivalents 
reportable segments housekeeping s net growth in reportable segment revenues resulted primarily from an increase in revenues attributable to service agreements entered into with new clients 
excluding revenue from ces operations  housekeeping segment revenue would have increased 
dietary s net growth in reportable segment revenues is primarily a result of providing this service to an increasing number of existing housekeeping clients 
excluding revenue from ces operations  dietary segment revenue would have increased 
we derived and  respectively  of housekeeping and dietary s revenues from our major client 
costs of services provided consolidated as a percentage of consolidated revenues  cost of services decreased to in from in the following table provides a comparison of the primary cost of services provided key indicators that we manage on a consolidated basis in evaluating our financial performance 
cost of services provided key indicators decr bad debt provision workers compensation and general liability insurance the bad debt expense remained consistent as a percentage of revenue as there was not an increase in expense recorded related to amounts due from clients which we evaluate as being subject to recovery uncertainty 
in the period when we evaluate that there is an uncertainty associated with the collectability of amounts due from a client  we record a bad debt provision based upon our initial estimate of ultimate collectability 
we revise such provision as additional information is available which we believe enables us to have a more accurate estimate of the collectability of an account 
some of our clients may experience liquidity problems because of governmental funding or operational issues 
such liquidity problems may cause them to not pay us as agreed upon or necessitate them filing for bankruptcy protection 
in the event of additional clients filing for bankruptcy protection  we would increase our bad debt provision during the reporting period when such filing occurs 
therefore  if more clients file for bankruptcy protection or if we have to increase our current provision related to existing bankruptcies  our bad debt provision may increase from our last two years average of  as a percentage of consolidated revenues 

table of contents the workers compensation and general liability insurance expense decrease is primarily the result of favorable claims experience during the year as compared to the overall increase in revenue for the year

we can realize volatility in housekeeping labor and other labor costs from time to time as a result of inefficient management of labor in respect to adhering to established labor and other labor costs benchmarks at various operational levels  or the timing of passing through to clients  changes in wage rates as a result of legislative or collective bargaining actions 
although we believe these factors were controlled effectively in in comparison to  ineffective control of these factors in the future would result in unfavorable volatility in our labor and other labor costs 
the increase in housekeeping supplies  as a percentage of housekeeping revenues  resulted primarily from an increase in linen supplies due to the growth in laundry and linen revenue 
we do realize volatility in the costs of supplies utilized in providing our housekeeping services but we work to mitigate any vendor price increases through efficiencies in managing such costs 
our supplies costs are impacted by commodity pricing factors  which in many cases are unpredictable and outside of our control 
although we endeavor to pass on to clients such increased costs  from time to time  sporadic unanticipated increases in the costs of certain supply items due to economic conditions may result in a timing delay in obtaining such increases from our clients 
additionally  if the increase is a result of a temporary market condition or change in availability of the specific commodity  and trends indicate it will not continue  we may not be able to pass such temporary increase on to our clients until the time of our next scheduled annual service billing review 
the increase in dietary labor and other labor costs  as a percentage of dietary revenues  resulted from inefficiencies in managing these costs at the facility level 
as noted above in the housekeeping labor and other labor costs discussion  our ability to control volatility in labor and other labor costs is directly related to our efficient management of labor at the various dietary operational levels in respect to established staffing benchmarks  as well as procuring on a timely basis increases from clients to reflect increased labor and other labor costs 
we believe dietary s increase in labor and other labor costs can be reduced in future periods by addressing such volatility factors effectively 
the decrease in dietary supplies  as a percentage of dietary revenues  is a result of improved management of these costs and more favorable vendor prices obtained through further consolidation of dietary supply vendors 
dietary supplies  to a much greater extent than housekeeping supplies  are impacted by commodity pricing factors  which in many cases are unpredictable and outside of our control 
although we endeavor to pass on to clients such 
table of contents increased costs  from time to time  sporadic unanticipated increases in the costs of certain supply items due to market economic conditions may result in a timing delay in passing on such increases to our clients 
it is this type of spike in dietary supplies costs that could most adversely affect dietary s operating performance 
the adverse effect would be realized if we delay in passing on such costs to our clients or in instances where we may not be able to pass such increase on to our clients until the time of our next scheduled service billing review 
we endeavor to mitigate the impact of unanticipated increase in such supplies costs thought consolidation of vendors  which increases our ability to obtain reduced pricing

b consolidated selling  general and administrative expense reported for the period presented 
although our growth in consolidated revenues was for the year ended december   selling  general and administrative expenses excluding gain of deferred compensation fund increased or  compared to the comparable period 
consequently for the year ended december   selling  general and administrative expenses excluding impact of deferred compensation fund  as a percentage of consolidated revenues  increased to of consolidated revenues as compared to in the comparable period 
this percentage increase resulted primarily from an increase in our payroll and payroll related expenses which grew in advance of the new business that was obtained during the course of the year 
we expect to maintain selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenues consistent with historical levels in the increase in consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses was partially attributable to an increase in compensation expense reported in this financial statement item reflecting the increase in our deferred compensation liability due to an increase in the market value of the investments held in our deferred compensation fund as noted below in consolidated investment and interest income discussion 
consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or 
consolidated investment and interest income investment and interest income  as a percentage of consolidated revenues  decreased to for the year ended december  compared to for the comparable period in the decrease in investment and interest income was primarily attributable to the decrease in interest earned  and realized and unrealized net gains on our marketable securities portfolio during this period 
additionally  we recognized a lower increase in the market value of the investments held in our deferred compensation fund compared to the prior year 
the decrease in interest income derived from our marketable securities resulted partially from a reduction in the amount of change in our marketable securities portfolio during from time to time in  we sold securities to increase cash and cash equivalents to fund our revenue growth 
additionally  we realized lower rate of returns on our marketable securities and on cash and cash equivalents during the year 

table of contents income before income taxes consolidated as a result of the discussion above related to revenues and expenses  consolidated income before income taxes for decreased slightly to  as a percentage of consolidated revenues  compared to in reportable segments housekeeping s increase in income before income taxes is primarily attributable to the gross profit earned on the increase in organic reportable segment revenues 
dietary s income before income taxes decrease of on a reportable segment basis is primarily attributable to factors discussed in dietary s cost of services key indicators  which was offset by the gross profit earned on the increase in reportable segment revenues and the ces contribution to dietary s increase in income before income taxes 
consolidated income taxes our effective tax rate was for the year ended december  and for the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily the result of tax credits realized upon the filing  in the third quarter of  of the income tax return compared to estimated tax credits for previous fiscal periods 
additionally  there was a slight decrease in the effective tax rate resulting from changes in the apportionment of our income among the states within which we do business that have positively impacted our combined state income taxes 
absent any significant change in federal  or state and local tax laws  we expect our effective tax rate for to approximate a rate between our rate of and our historical rate of 
our actual rate will be impacted by our ability to obtain available tax credits related to the hiring incentives to restore employment act hire act that was enacted in march however  due to the requirements of the realization of this credit  the effect cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
our effective tax rate differs from the federal income tax statutory rate principally because of the effect of state and local income taxes

we revise such provision as additional information is available which we believe enables us to have a more accurate estimate of the collectability of an account 
some of our clients may experience liquidity problems because of governmental funding or operational issues 
such liquidity problems may cause them to not pay us as agreed upon or necessitate them filing for bankruptcy protection 
in the event of additional clients filing for bankruptcy protection  we would increase our bad debt provision during our reporting period of such filing 
therefore  if more clients file for bankruptcy protection or if we have to increase our current provision related to existing bankruptcies  our bad debt provision may increase from our last two years average of  as a percentage of consolidated revenues

as noted above in the housekeeping labor and other labor costs discussion  our ability to control volatility in labor and other labor costs is directly related to our efficient management of labor at the various dietary operational levels in respect to established staffing benchmarks  as well as procuring on a timely basis increases from clients to reflect increased labor and other labor costs 
we believe dietary s improvement in labor and other labor costs is a result of addressing such volatility factors effectively 
the slight decrease in dietary supplies  as a percentage of dietary segment revenues  is a result of better management of these supplies at the facility level and improved vendor prices resulting from increases in our purchasing volume of dietary supplies

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting standards generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we consider the three policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on our judgment 
therefore  it should be noted that financial reporting results rely on estimating the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
specific risks for these critical accounting policies and estimates are described in the following paragraphs 
for these estimates  we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
any such adjustments or revisions to estimates could result in material differences to previously reported amounts 
the three policies discussed are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting standards generally accepted in the united states  with no need for our judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which our judgment in selecting another available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which are included in this annual report on form k  which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance is established as losses are estimated to have occurred through a provision for bad debts charged to earnings 
the allowance is evaluated based on our periodic review of accounts and notes receivable and is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
we have had varying collection experience with respect to our accounts and notes receivable 
when contractual terms are not met  we generally encounter difficulty in collecting amounts due from certain of our clients 
therefore  we have sometimes been required to extend the period of payment for certain clients beyond contractual terms 
these clients include those who have terminated service agreements and slow payers experiencing financial difficulties 
in making credit evaluations  in addition to analyzing and anticipating  where possible  the specific cases described above  we consider the general collection risks associated with trends in the long term care industry 
we also establish credit limits  perform ongoing credit evaluations  and monitor accounts to minimize the risk of loss 

table of contents in accordance with the risk of extending credit  we regularly evaluate our accounts and notes receivable for impairment or loss of value and when appropriate  will provide in our allowance for such receivables 
we generally follow a policy of reserving for receivables due from clients in bankruptcy  clients with which we are in litigation for collection and other slow paying clients 
the reserve is based upon our estimates of ultimate collectability 
correspondingly  once our recovery of a receivable is determined through litigation  bankruptcy proceedings or negotiation to be less than the recorded amount on our balance sheet  we will charge off the applicable amount to the allowance 
our methodology for the allowance is based upon a risk based evaluation of accounts and notes receivable associated with a client s ability to make payments 
such allowance generally consists of an initial amount established based upon criteria generally applied if and when a client account files bankruptcy  is placed for collection litigation and or is considered to be pending collection litigation 
the initial allowance is adjusted either higher or lower when additional information is available to permit a more accurate estimate of the collectability of an account 
summarized below for the years through are the aggregate account balances for the three allowance criteria noted above  net write offs of client accounts  bad debt provision and allowance for doubtful accounts 
aggregate account balances of clients in bankruptcy or in or pending net write offs bad debt allowance for year ending collection litigation of client accounts provision doubtful accounts at december   we identified accounts totaling  that require an allowance based on potential impairment or loss of value 
an allowance totaling  was provided for these accounts at such date 
actual collections of these accounts could differ from that which we currently estimate 
if our actual collection experience is less than our estimate  the related increase to our allowance would decrease net income by approximately  notwithstanding our efforts to minimize credit risk exposure  our clients could be adversely affected if future industry trends  as more fully discussed under liquidity and capital resources below  and as further described in this annual report on form k in part i under risk factors  government regulation of clients and service agreements collections  change in such a manner as to negatively impact the cash flows of our clients 
if our clients experience a negative impact in their cash flows  it would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
accrued insurance claims we currently have a paid loss retrospective insurance plan for general liability and workers compensation insurance  which comprise approximately of our liabilities at december  our accounting for this plan is affected by various uncertainties because we must make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date 
we address these uncertainties by regularly evaluating our claims pay out experience  present value factor and other factors related to the nature of specific claims in arriving at the basis for our accrued insurance claims estimate 
our evaluations are based primarily on current information derived from reviewing our claims experience and industry 
table of contents trends 
in the event that our claims experience and or industry trends result in an unfavorable change  it would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
under these plans  predetermined loss limits are arranged with an insurance company to limit both our per occurrence cash outlay and annual insurance plan cost 
for workers compensation  we record a reserve based on the present value of future payments  including an estimate of claims incurred but not reported  that are developed as a result of a review of our historical data and open claims 
the present value of the payout is determined by applying an discount factor against the estimated value of the claims over the estimated remaining pay out period 
reducing the discount factor by would reduce net income by approximately  additionally  reducing the estimated payout period by six months would result in an approximate  reduction in net income 
for general liability  we record a reserve for the estimated ultimate amounts to be paid for known claims 
the estimated ultimate reserve amount recorded is derived from the estimated claim reserves provided by our insurance carrier reduced by an historical experience factor 
asset valuations and review for potential impairment we review our fixed assets  deferred income taxes  goodwill and other intangible assets at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
this review requires that we make assumptions regarding the value of these assets and the changes in circumstances that would affect the carrying value of these assets 
if such analysis indicates that a possible impairment may exist  we are then required to estimate the fair value of the asset and  as deemed appropriate  expense all or a portion of the asset 
the determination of fair value includes numerous uncertainties  such as the impact of competition on future value 
we believe that we have made reasonable estimates and judgments in determining whether our long term assets have been impaired  however  if there is a material change in the assumptions used in our determination of fair value or if there is a material change in economic conditions or circumstances influencing fair value  we could be required to recognize certain impairment charges in the future 
as a result of our most recent reviews  no changes in asset values were required 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash and cash equivalents  and marketable securities of  and working capital of  compared to december  cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of  and working capital of  we view our cash and cash equivalents  and marketable securities as our principal measure of liquidity 
our current ratio at december  decreased to to from to at december  this decrease resulted primarily from increases in accrued payroll  withheld payroll taxes primarily resulting from the timing of such payments and accrued insurance claims expense 
additionally  the decrease was impacted by the slight decline in our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at december  from december  while our revenue and net income increased in  our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities did not experience a similar increase due to the investment required to support our revenue growth and the payment of dividends to shareholders 
the current ratio decrease was favorably impacted by the increase in accounts and notes receivable resulting from our increase in revenues 
on an historical basis  our operations have generally produced consistent cash flow and have required limited capital resources 
we believe our current and near term cash flow positions will enable us to fund our continued anticipated growth 

table of contents operating activities the net cash provided by our operating activities was  for the year ended december  the principal sources of net cash flows from operating activities for were net income  and non cash charges to operations for bad debt provisions  depreciation and amortization 
additionally  operating activities cash flows increased by  as a result of the increase in accounts payable and other accrued expenses  accrued payroll and payroll taxes  accrued insurance claims  and deferred compensation liability  and decrease in prepaid expense and other assets 
the operating activities that used the largest amount of cash during was a net increase of  in accounts and notes receivable  long term notes receivable  and an increase of prepaid income taxes  due to the timing of payments and inventory  resulting primarily from the growth in the company s revenues for investing activities our principal source of cash in investing activities for was  for the net sales and maturities of marketable securities 
the net sales and maturities of marketable securities enabled us to increase cash and cash equivalents to support the increase in client facilities in and dividend payments 
additionally  we expended  for the purchase of housekeeping equipment  computer software and equipment  and laundry equipment installations 
see capital expenditures below 
financing activities we have paid regular quarterly cash dividends since the second quarter of during  we paid to shareholders regular quarterly cash dividends totaling  as follows 
st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter cash dividend per common share total cash dividends paid record date february april july october payment date march may august november additionally  on january   our board of directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of 
per common share  which will be paid on march  to shareholders of record as of the close of business on february  our board of directors reviews our dividend policy on a quarterly basis 
although there can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends or the amount of the dividend  we expect to continue to pay a regular quarterly cash dividend 
in connection with the establishment of our dividend policy  we adopted a dividend reinvestment plan in during the year ended december  we elected not to purchase any of our common stock but we remain authorized to purchase  of our common stock pursuant to previous board of directors approvals 
during the year ended december   we received proceeds of  from the exercise of stock options by employees and directors 
additionally  as a result of deductions derived from the stock option exercises  we recognized an income tax benefit of 
table of contents contractual obligations our future contractual obligations and commitments at december  consist of the following years ended december  operating lease expense line of credit we have a  increased to  on january  bank line of credit on which we may draw to meet short term liquidity requirements in excess of internally generated cash flow 
amounts drawn under the line of credit are payable upon demand 
at december   there were no borrowings under the line of credit 
however  at such date  we had outstanding a  increased to  on january  irrevocable standby letter of credit which relates to payment obligations under our insurance programs 
as a result of the letter of credit issued  the amount available under the line of credit was reduced by  at december  the line of credit requires us to satisfy two financial covenants 
such covenants and their respective status at december  were as follows covenant description and requirement status at december  commitment coverage ratio cash and cash equivalents plus marketable securities must equal or exceed outstanding obligations under the line by a multiple of tangible net worth must exceed  as noted above  we complied with both financial covenants at december  and expect to continue to remain in compliance with all such financial covenants 
as of january   the commitment coverage rate has been modified so that cash and cash equivalents plus marketable securities must equal or exceed outstanding obligations under the line by a multiple of versus the multiple of as of december  
this line of credit expires on june  we believe the line of credit will be renewed at that time 
accounts and notes receivable we expend considerable effort to collect the amounts due for our services on the terms agreed upon with our clients 
many of our clients participate in programs funded by federal and state governmental agencies which historically have encountered delays in making payments to its program participants 
congress has enacted a number of laws during the past decade that have significantly altered  or may alter  overall government reimbursement for nursing home services 
because our clients revenues are generally dependent on medicare and medicaid reimbursement funding rates and mechanisms  the overall effect of these laws and trends in the long term care industry have affected and could adversely affect the liquidity of our clients  resulting in their inability to make payments to us on agreed upon payment terms 
these factors  in addition to delays in payments from clients  have resulted in and could continue to result in significant additional bad debts in the near future 
whenever possible  when a client falls behind in making agreed upon payments  we convert the unpaid accounts receivable to interest bearing promissory notes 
the promissory notes receivable provide a means by which to further evidence the amounts owed and provide a definitive repayment plan and therefore may ultimately enhance our ability to collect the amounts due 
at december  and  we had  and  net of reserves  respectively  of such promissory notes outstanding 
additionally  we consider restructuring service agreements from full service to management only service in the case of certain clients experiencing financial difficulties 
we 
table of contents believe that such restructurings may provide us with a means to maintain a relationship with the client while at the same time minimizing collection exposure 
as a result of the current economic crisis  many states have significant budget deficits 
state medicaid programs are experiencing increased demand  and with lower revenues than projected  they have fewer resources to support their medicaid programs 
in addition  in march  comprehensive health care reform legislation was signed into law 
the act will significantly impact the governmental healthcare programs our clients participate in  and reimbursements received there under from governmental or third party payors 
furthermore  in the coming year  new proposals or additional changes in existing regulations could be made under the act which could directly impact the governmental reimbursement programs in which our clients participate 
as a result  some state medicaid programs are reconsidering previously approved increases in nursing home reimbursement or are considering delaying those increases 
a few states have indicated they may run out of cash to pay medicaid providers  including nursing homes 
any negative changes in our clients reimbursements would negatively impact our results of operations 
although we are currently evaluating the act s effect on our client base  we may not know the full effect until such a time as these laws are fully implemented and the centers for medicare and medicaid services and other agencies issue applicable regulations or guidance 
we have had varying collection experience with respect to our accounts and notes receivable 
when contractual terms are not met  we generally encounter difficulty in collecting amounts due from certain of our clients 
therefore  we have sometimes been required to extend the period of payment for certain clients beyond contractual terms 
these clients include those who have terminated service agreements and slow payers experiencing financial difficulties 
in order to provide for these collection problems and the general risk associated with the granting of credit terms  we have recorded bad debt provisions in an allowance for doubtful accounts of   and  in the years ended december   and  respectively 
these provisions represent approximately  
and  as a percentage of total revenues for such respective periods 
in making our credit evaluations  in addition to analyzing and anticipating  where possible  the specific cases described above  we consider the general collection risk associated with trends in the long term care industry 
we also establish credit limits  perform ongoing credit evaluation and monitor accounts to minimize the risk of loss 
notwithstanding our efforts to minimize credit risk exposure  our clients could be adversely affected if future industry trends change in such a manner as to negatively impact their cash flows 
if our clients experience a negative impact in their cash flows  it would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
at december   amounts due from our major client represented less than of our accounts receivable balance 
if such client changes its payment terms  it would increase our accounts receivable balance and have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and cash and cash equivalents 
insurance programs we have a paid loss retrospective insurance plan for general liability and workers compensation insurance 
under these plans  pre determined loss limits are arranged with an insurance company to limit both our per occurrence cash outlay and annual insurance plan cost 
for workers compensation  we record a reserve based on the present value of future payments  including an estimate of claims incurred but not reported  that are developed as a result of a review of our historical data and open claims 
the present value of the payout is determined by applying an discount factor against the estimated value of the claims over the estimated remaining pay out period 

table of contents for general liability  we record a reserve for the estimated ultimate amounts to be paid for known claims 
the estimated ultimate reserve amount recorded is derived from the estimated claim reserves provided by our insurance carrier reduced by an historical experience factor 
we regularly evaluate our claims pay out experience  present value factor and other factors related to the nature of specific claims in arriving at the basis for our accrued insurance claims estimate 
our evaluation is based primarily on current information derived from reviewing our claims experience and industry trends 
in the event that our claims experience and or industry trends result in an unfavorable change  it would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
capital expenditures the level of capital expenditures is generally dependent on the number of new clients obtained 
such capital expenditures primarily consist of housekeeping equipment purchases  laundry and linen equipment installations  and computer hardware and software 
although we have no specific material commitments for capital expenditures through the end of calendar year  we estimate that for the period we will have capital expenditures of  to  in connection with housekeeping equipment purchases and laundry and linen equipment installations in our clients facilities  as well as expenditures relating to internal data processing hardware and software requirements 
we believe that our cash from operations  existing cash and cash equivalents balance and credit line will be adequate for the foreseeable future to satisfy the needs of our operations and to fund our anticipated growth 
however  should these sources not be sufficient  we would  if necessary  seek to obtain necessary working capital from such sources as long term debt or equity financing 
material off balance sheet arrangements we have no material off balance sheet arrangements  other than our irrevocable standby letter of credit previously discussed 
effects of inflation although there can be no assurance thereof  we believe that in most instances we will be able to recover increases in costs attributable to inflation by passing through such cost increases to our clients 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   we had  in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
in accordance with us gaap  the fair value of all of our cash equivalents and marketable securities is determined based on level inputs  which consist of quoted prices whose value is based upon quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active  and model based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market 
we place our cash investments in instruments that meet credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate investments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to an increase in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if there is a decline in the fair value of our investments
