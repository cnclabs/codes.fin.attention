executive overview fiscal years ended june  and the following highlights are discussed in further detail within this form k 
the reader is encouraged to read this form k in its entirety to gain a more complete understanding of factors impacting company performance and financial condition 
product revenue from continuing operations decreased approximately  or during fiscal year ended june  as compared to the prior fiscal year 
the decrease is primarily related to decreased sales in the company s ecd segment which decreased approximately  offset by sales increases in the sonomed escalon segment of 
other revenue from continuing operations decreased approximately  or during the fiscal year ended june   as compared to the prior fiscal year 
the company received royalty income from licensing of certain biocode technology to tecom for  in fiscal year  and the company did not continue to receive royalties in fiscal year biocode has fulfilled all of its responsibilities under the contract and has recognized the remaining contract amount in other revenue during the year ended june  cost of goods sold as a percentage of product revenue from continuing operations increased to approximately of product revenues during the fiscal year ended june   as compared to approximately of product revenue for the prior fiscal year 
operating expenses decreased approximately during the fiscal year ended june  as compared to the prior fiscal year

in the ecd segment  product revenue decreased  or  as compared to last fiscal year 
the decrease is related to a decrease in revenue at the biocode facility related to a change in french law that requires all of the country s labs to consolidate into large regional labs 
ecd s instruments are not suitable for large labs so the company anticipates that instrument revenue in france will continue to significantly decline 
in addition  there was a decrease in pdq instrument sales during the current period as drew discontinued its manufacturing agreement for this aging instrument and a decrease in drew instruments during the current period as compared to the same period last year 
in the sonomed escalon segment  product revenue increased  or  to  during the year ended june   as compared to the last fiscal year 
the increase in revenue is attributed to the increased sales in sonomed s ultrasound products of  related to increased demand in both domestic and international markets  an increase in trek s surgical and gas products of  offset by a decrease of  in emi s digital imaging camera s and axis image management systems 
while the axis system has been well accepted in the market place  it appears to have a much longer selling cycle than originally envisioned 
the decrease in the traditional digital imaging system along with the extended sales cycle of the axis product caused management to re evaluate the goodwill recorded on emi s financial statements during the third quarter of the current fiscal year 
this evaluation resulted in the write off of emi s goodwill during the year ended june  see footnote of the consolidated financial statements dated june

cost of goods sold in the ecd segment totaled  or of product revenue for the fiscal year ended june  as compared to  or of product revenue  for the prior fiscal year 
the increase in cost of goods sold as percentage of revenue is related to the write off of inventories of approximately  of which approximately  of the write off was related to writing down the cost of the trilogy instrument to its net realizable value 
trilogy sales have continued to decline and prospects for future sales are not good as it was never fully accepted in the marketplace 
the remaining  write down is related to instruments in france that are impaired due to the change in french law that requires labs in france to consolidate into large regional labs 
in addition  margins have been compressed due to increased production costs at our dallas facility 
the company decided in june that it would close its manufacturing facility in dallas and outsource certain instruments historically manufactured in dallas 
the company anticipates ceasing manufacturing activities in dallas by september  see footnote of the consolidated financial statements dated june  
cost of goods sold in the sonomed escalon business segment totaled  or of product revenue  for the fiscal year ended june  as compared to  or of product revenue  for the prior fiscal year 
the modest decrease of in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue is due mainly to the product mix sold during the current period with increased sales in the higher margin pacscan plus and an increase in higher margin domestic sales

marketing  general and administrative expenses in the ecd business segment decreased  or  to  as compared to the same period last fiscal year 
the continued decrease is related to the ongoing implementation of an austerity plan concerning our dallas facility 
over the past two years the headcount at our dallas facility has steadily declined due to absorbing certain general and administrative functions at drew s miami location 
in addition  during june it was decided that all manufacturing operations at our dallas facility will be outsourced and the facility in dallas will be closed on or about september  it is anticipated that this closure will provide significant saving in general and administrative expenses in the coming year 
marketing  general and administrative expenses in the sonomed escalon business segment increased  or  to  as compared to the same period last fiscal year 
the increase is due to an increase in payroll  travel  exhibits  and expenses related to the re branding of sonomed  emi and trek under the sonomed escalon name 
marketing  general and administrative expenses in the corporate increased  or  to  as compared to the same period last fiscal year 
the increase is due to an increase in consulting  legal  office rent  medical insurance and payroll expense

all future research projects will be outsourced on an as needed basis 
research and development expenses in the sonomed escalon segment decreased  or  to  as compared to the last fiscal year 
the decrease is related to the completion of the pacscan plus and the master vu a products and the decision to suspend further work on the vumax iii  offset by increased research and development expense related to the continued upgrading of our digital imaging product offering

commencing july   the company began recognizing all of the losses of otm in its consolidated financial statements 
otm is an early stage privately held company

otm began operations during the three month period ended september  see note of the notes to june  consolidated financial statements 
interest expense was  and  for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
the decrease is related to payment and restructuring of debt 
goodwill impairment emi at march  management became concerned about emi s performance year to date as compared to our projected budget 
the projected budget included sales related to emi s new image management system  axis  as well as traditional legacy digital imaging systems 
a significant portion of the axis product target market represents institutions requiring large scale  multi instrument solutions  which has resulted in a much longer sales cycle than we had originally envisioned 
while the feedback from initial and potential customers of the axis product has been positive  converting this interest into sales has not materialized to date at the levels we had originally projected 
emi has also encountered unexpected lagging demand for its legacy digital imaging systems primarily due to institutions allocating a disproportionate level of their capital budgets toward purchasing optical coherence tomography oct devices 
it was anticipated that the emerging oct technology would erode legacy digital imaging product sales due to competition for budgetary resources  however  the level has been greater than originally expected and not reflected in our original projections 
oct and digital imaging technologies are complementary and it is not known whether or for how long the lower available capital budgets for digital imaging will continue 
these events will negatively affect the evaluation of the future operating results and cash flows of emi 
the company typically tests goodwill for possible impairment on an annual basis at june  and at any other time events occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may be impaired 
management determined that the events discussed above warranted performing an interim test of goodwill for possible impairment during the quarter ended march  the first step of the fasb asc impairment analysis consists of a comparison of the fair value of the reporting segment with its carrying amount  including the goodwill 
the fair value was determined based on the income approach  which estimates the fair value based on the future discounted cash flows 
under the income approach  the company assumed  with respect to emi  a forecasted cash flow period of five years  long term annual growth rates of and a discount rate of 
based on the interim income approach analysis that was performed for emi it was determined that the carrying amount of the goodwill was in excess of its respective fair value 
as such  the company was required to perform the second step analysis in order to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment 
the second step analysis consisted of comparing the implied fair value of the goodwill with the carrying amount of the goodwill  with an impairment charge resulting from any excess of the carrying value of the goodwill over the implied fair value of the goodwill 
based on the second step analysis  the company concluded that all  of the goodwill recorded at emi was impaired 
as a result  the company recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge to continuing operations totaling  during the year ended june  
table of contents the determination as to whether a write down of goodwill is necessary involves significant judgment based on short term and long term projections of the company 
the assumptions supporting the estimated future cash flows of the reporting segment  including profit margins  long term forecasts  discount rates and terminal growth rates  reflect the company s best estimates

cash flows used in investing and financing activities cash flows used in investing activities for were approximately  this amount is made up of purchases of fixed assets of  and investment in otm of  cash flows provided by investing activities for were approximately  mainly due to proceeds from sales of vascular assets of  and reduced by cash outflows to purchase of fixed assets of  and investment in otm of  any necessary capital expenditures have generally been funded out of cash from operations  and the company is not aware of any factors that would cause historical capital expenditure levels to not be indicative of capital expenditures in the future and  accordingly  does not believe that the company will have to commit material resources to capital investment for the foreseeable future 
cash flows used in financing activities in the amount of  during relate to repayment of debt 
cash flows used in financing activities for were approximately  the cash used in financing activities decreased as the company amended its seller financed debt in connection with the biocode transaction in april the company continues to operate under an austerity plan to stem the recurring losses at drew see footnote of the statements to the consolidated financial statements for june  
if the company is unable to achieve improvement in this area in the near term  it is not likely that our existing cash and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund activities throughout the next to months without curtailing certain business activities 
the company s forecast of the period of time through which h its financial resources will be adequate to support its operations is a forward looking statement and involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors  including the factors discussed in risk factors 

table of contents if the company raises funds in the future  the company may be required to raise those funds through public or private financings  strategic relationships or other arrangements at prices and other terms that may not be as favorable as they would be absent such qualification 
the sale of additional equity and debt securities may result in additional dilution to the company s shareholders 
additional financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us or at all 
debt history on december   drew acquired certain assets of biocode for   euros plus acquisition costs of approximately  the sales price was payable in cash of approximately  approximately  euros and  in debt from drew 
the seller provided financing is collateralized by certain assets of biocode 
biocode assets were vertically integrated into the company s clinical diagnostics business that includes drew and jas 
on april  the company amended its seller financed debt in connection with the biocode transaction 
under the terms of the debt refinancing  the company agreed to pay the balance of the seller provided financing of  euros by the sum per month in euros having an exchange value of  united states dollars as of the date of payment 
interest remained unchanged and will accrue on the outstanding amount of the purchase price at an interest rate of per year on the basis of the actual days elapsed and a day year 
the first payment under the amended agreement was paid on may  upon the th month after this amendment  the company agreed to pay the balance of the outstanding amount in euros in full in one payment 
at the time of the refinancing  the current portion of our long term debt was reduced from approximately  to  forward looking statement about significant items likely to impact liquidity the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis  which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
the company has incurred recurring operating losses and negative cash flows from operating activities 
these conditions raise substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
the financial statements for the fiscal year ended june  do not include any adjustments relating to the realization of the carrying value of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern 
the company s continuance as a going concern is dependent on our future profitability and on the on going support of the company s shareholders  affiliates and creditors 
in order to mitigate the going concern issues  the company is actively pursuing business partnerships  managing the company s continuing operations  and seeking capital funding on an ongoing basis via the issuance of securities and private placements 
if the company is unsuccessful in its efforts to raise additional capital in the near term  the company may be required to significantly reduce its research  development  and administrative activities  including further reduction of its employee base 
in the normal course of business  the company engages in discussions with third parties regarding possible acquisitions  strategic alliances  joint ventures and divestitures 
as a result of any such transactions  the company s financial results may differ from the investment community s expectations in a given quarter 
in addition  acquisitions and alliances may require the company to integrate a different company culture  management team  business infrastructure  accounting systems and financial reporting systems 
the company may not be able to effect any such acquisitions or alliances 
the company may have difficulty developing  manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired business in a way that enhances the performance of the company s combined businesses or product lines to realize the value from any expected synergies 
depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition  the company s successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors  including the retention of key employees and the management of facilities and employees in separate geographical areas 
these efforts require varying levels of management resources  which may divert the company s attention from other business operations 

table of contents the company has incurred recurring operating losses and negative cash flows from operating activities related to its drew division which includes the recently acquired biocode 
the company is experiencing lower than expected sales from biocode related to reduced instrument sales due to uncertainty surrounding pending regulatory changes under french law 
the company does not know when this uncertainty will be resolved nor what impact the new law if enacted will have on biocode s revenues in the future 
for the year ended june   biocode generated a net loss from operations of approximately million 
also  since its acquisition of drew the company loaned approximately million to drew  and during fiscal year ended june  invested additional capital in biocode of approximately  the funds were primarily used to procure components to build up inventory to support the manufacturing process  to pay off accounts payable and debt of drew  and to expand the sales and marketing and research and development efforts  to fund new product development and underwrite operating losses since its acquisition 
the company cannot rule out that further working capital will be required by drew and biocode 
if the company does not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such transactions  the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations and stock price could be negatively impacted 
also  the company s results may be adversely impacted because of acquisition related costs  amortization costs for certain intangible assets and impairment losses related to goodwill in connection with such transactions 
finally  acquisitions or alliances by the company may not occur  which could impair the company s growth 
common stock the company s common stock is currently listed on the nasdaq capital market 
in order to continue to be listed on the nasdaq capital market  the following requirements must be met shareholders equity of  or market value of listed securities of  or net income from continuing operations in the latest fiscal year or two of the last three fiscal years of   publicly held shares   market value of publicly held shares  a minimum bid price of  round lot shareholders  two market makers  and compliance with corporate governance standards 
as of june   the company was in compliance with these continued listing requirements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that impact amounts reported therein 
the most significant of those involve the application of fasb issued authoritative guidance concerning revenue recognition  goodwill and other intangible assets  discussed further in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
the financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  and  as such  include amounts based on informed estimates and judgments of management 
for example  estimates are used in determining valuation allowances for deferred income taxes  uncollectible receivables  obsolete inventory  sales returns and rebates warranty liabilities and purchased intangible assets 
actual results achieved in the future could differ from current estimates 
the company used what it believes are reasonable assumptions and  where applicable  established valuation techniques in making its estimates 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue from the sale of its products at the time of shipment  when title and risk of loss transfer 
the company provides products to its distributors at agreed wholesale prices and 
table of contents to the balance of its customers at set retail prices 
distributors can receive discounts for accepting high volume shipments 
the discounts are reflected immediately in the net invoice price  which is the basis for revenue recognition 
no further material discounts are given 
the company s considerations for recognizing revenue upon shipment of product to a distributor are based on the following persuasive evidence that an arrangement purchase order and sales invoice exists between a willing buyer distributor and the company that outlines the terms of the sale company information  quantity of goods  purchase price and payment terms 
the buyer distributor does not have a right of return 
shipping terms are ex factory shipping point 
at this point the buyer distributor takes title to the goods and is responsible for all risks and rewards of ownership  including insuring the goods as necessary 
the company s price to the buyer distributor is fixed and determinable as specifically outlined on the sales invoice 
the sales arrangement does not have customer cancellation or termination clauses 
the buyer distributor places a purchase order with the company  the terms of the sale are cash  cod or credit 
customer credit is determined based on the company s policies and procedures related to the buyer s distributor s creditworthiness 
based on this determination  the company believes that collectability is reasonably assured 
the company assesses collectability based on creditworthiness of the customer and past transaction history 
the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and does not require collateral from its customers 
for many of the company s international customers  the company requires an irrevocable letter of credit to be issued by the customer before the purchase order is accepted 
valuation of intangible assets the company annually evaluates for impairment its intangible assets and goodwill in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable  see footnote to consolidated financial statements included in this form k for details on a goodwill impairment charge related to the carrying amount of emi s goodwill 
these intangible assets include goodwill  trademarks and trade names 
recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amounts to future discounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
if identifiable intangibles are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair market value 
the company does not amortize intangible assets with indefinite useful lives  rather such assets are required to be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired 
the company performs its intangible asset impairment tests on or about june  of each year 
any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial statements if and when an impairment charge is recorded 
income loss per share the company computes net income loss per share under the provisions of fasb issued authoritative guidance 
under the provisions of fasb issued authoritative guidance  basic and diluted net income loss per share is computed by dividing the net income loss for the period by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period 
the calculation of diluted net income loss per share excludes potential common shares if the impact is anti dilutive 
basic earnings per share are computed by dividing net income loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period 
diluted earnings per share are determined in the same manner as basic earnings per share  except that the number of shares is increased by assuming exercise of dilutive stock options and warrants using the treasury stock method 

table of contents taxes estimates of taxable income of the various legal entities and jurisdictions are used in the tax rate calculation 
management uses judgment in estimating what the company s income will be for the year 
since judgment is involved  there is a risk that the tax rate may significantly increase or decrease in any period 
in determining income loss for financial statement purposes  management must make certain estimates and judgments 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets  which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 
fasb issued authoritative guidance concerning accounting for income taxes also requires that the deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance  if based on the available evidence  it is more likely that not that all or some portion of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods 
in evaluating the company s ability to recover the company s deferred tax assets  management considers all available positive and negative evidence including the company s past operating results  the existence of cumulative losses and near term forecasts of future taxable income that is consistent with the plans and estimates management is using to manage the underlying businesses 
through june   the company has recorded a valuation allowance against the company s net operating losses for substantially all of the deferred tax asset due to uncertainty of their realization as a result of the company s earnings history  the number of years the company s net operating losses and tax credits can be carried forward  the existence of taxable temporary differences and near term earnings expectations 
the amount of the valuation allowance could decrease if facts and circumstances change that materially increase taxable income prior to the expiration of the loss carryforwards 
any reduction would reduce increase the income tax expense benefit in the period such determination is made by the company 
the company has adopted fasb issued guidance related to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which provides a comprehensive model for the recognition  measurement  and disclosure in financial statements of uncertain income tax positions that a company has taken or expects to take on a tax return 
under the fasb guidance a company can recognize the benefit of an income tax position only if it is more likely than not greater than that the tax position will be sustained upon tax examination  based solely on the technical merits of the tax position 
otherwise  no benefit can be recognized 
the tax benefits recognized are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
additionally  companies are required to accrue interest and related penalties  if applicable  on all tax exposures for which reserves have been established consistent with jurisdictional tax laws 
the company has elected to recognize interest expense and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of its provision for income taxes 
stock based compensation stock based compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted after july  is based on the grant date fair value estimate in accordance with the provisions of the fasb issued guidance 
the company recognizes these compensation costs on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award 
valuations are based on highly subjective assumptions about the future  including stock price volatility and exercise patterns 
the fair value of share based payment awards was estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of the company s stock 
the company uses historical data to estimate option exercise and employee terminations 
the expected term of options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
the risk free rate for periods within the expected life of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant 

table of contents recently issued accounting standards in october  the fasb issued an amendment to the accounting for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
this amendment provides guidance on determining whether multiple deliverables exist  how the arrangements should be separated and how the consideration paid should be allocated 
as a result of this amendment  entities may be able to separate multiple deliverable arrangements in more circumstances than under previous accounting guidance 
this guidance amends the requirement to establish the fair value of undelivered products and services based on objective evidence and instead provides for separate revenue recognition based upon management s best estimate of the selling price for an undelivered item when there is no other means to determine the fair value of that undelivered item 
the previous guidance previously required that the fair value of the undelivered item reflect the price of the item either sold in a separate transaction between unrelated third parties or the price charged for each item when the item is sold separately by the vendor 
if the fair value of all of the elements in the arrangement was not determinable  then revenue was deferred until all of the items were delivered or fair value was determined 
this amendment became be effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  the company adopted this standard and the standard did not have material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in december  fasb issued asu no 
 improvements to financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities 
this accounting standards update amends the fasb accounting standards codification asu for the issuance of fasb statement no 
 amendments to fasb interpretation no 
r 
the amendments in this accounting standards update replace the quantitative based risks and rewards calculation for determining which reporting entity  if any  has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity with an approach focused on identifying which reporting entity has the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity 
an approach that is expected to be primarily qualitative will be more effective for identifying which reporting entity has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity 
the amendments in this update also require additional disclosures about a reporting entity s involvement in variable interest entities  which will enhance the information provided to users of financial statements 
the company adopted this standard and the standard did not have material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in january  fasb issued asu no 
 accounting for distributions to shareholders with components of stock and cash 
the amendments in this update clarify that the stock portion of a distribution to shareholders that allows them to elect to receive cash or stock with a potential limitation on the total amount of cash that all shareholders can elect to receive in the aggregate is considered a share issuance that is reflected in eps prospectively and is not a stock dividend for purposes of applying topics and equity and earnings per share 
the amendments in this update became effective for interim and annual periods ending on or after december   and should be applied on a retrospective basis 
the company adopted this standard and the standard did not have material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in january  fasb issued asu no 
regarding accounting and reporting for decreases in ownership of a subsidiary 
under this guidance  an entity is required to deconsolidate a subsidiary when the entity ceases to have a controlling financial interest in the subsidiary 
upon deconsolidation of a subsidiary  an entity recognizes a gain or loss on the transaction and measures any retained investment in the subsidiary at fair value 
in contrast  an entity is required to account for a decrease in its ownership interest of a subsidiary that does not result in a change of control of the subsidiary as an equity transaction 
this asu clarifies the scope of the decrease in ownership provisions  and expands the disclosures about the deconsolidation of a subsidiary or de recognition of a group of assets 
this asu is effective beginning in the first interim or annual reporting period ending on or after december  the adoption of this asu did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in january  fasb issued asu no 
 improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
this update provides amendments to subtopic that requires new disclosure to include transfers in and out of levels and and activity in level fair value measurements 
further  this update clarifies existing disclosures on level of disaggregation and disclosures about inputs and valuation techniques 
a reporting entity should provide fair value measurement disclosures for each class of assets and liabilities and should provide disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements 
those disclosures are required for fair value measurements that fall in either level or level the new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosures became effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements in the roll forward of activity in level fair value measurements
