you should read the following management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this report 
the company the company was incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware in with the name ihop corp 
effective june   the name of the company was changed to dineequity  inc the company  we or our 
the first international house of pancakes ihop restaurant opened in in toluca lake  california 
shortly thereafter we began developing and franchising additional restaurants 
in november  we completed the acquisition of applebee international  inc applebee which became a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
through various ihop and applebee subsidiaries see exhibit  subsidiaries of dineequity  inc we own and operate two restaurant concepts in the casual dining and family dining categories of the food service industry applebee neighborhood grill and bar and ihop 
dineequity  inc is the parent of the ihop and applebee subsidiaries 
references herein to applebee and ihop restaurants are to these two restaurant concepts  whether operated by franchisees or the company 
sales of restaurants that are owned by franchisees and area licensees are not attributable to the company 
with more than  restaurants combined  we are the largest full service restaurant company in the world 
key overall strategies dineequity key strategies at dineequity  we have a fundamentally differentiated approach to brand management that centers on the powerful and strategic combination of marketing  menu  operations and remodel initiatives that creates a unique and relevant connection with our guests 
additionally  our shared services operating matrix allows our brands to focus on those things that drive the business while leveraging the resources and expertise of our scalable  centralized support structure 
we believe this is a competitive point of difference 
together  this closely integrated approach results in differentiated brand performance that drives dineequity growth and delivers results for our shareholders 
applebee key strategies we are in the process of a multi year effort to revitalize the applebee brand 
applebee domestic system wide same restaurant sales increased in this was applebee first full year 
table of contents of positive results since and outpaced our group of competitors 
we accomplished this by executing our key strategies as follows drive profitable sales and traffic continued to focus on meeting the consumer need for value throughout  with such promotions as the midyear introduction of our new sizzling skillets starting at nationwide  the rotation of new products into our for offering and ended the year with the introduction of flavor loaded steaks starting at nationwide  continued innovation of the menu 
since the acquisition in  more than of applebee menu now consists of either new offerings or improved offerings with better  fresher ingredients  expanded our unique healthy food offerings by launching our under calorie menu in january to complement our weight watchers menu and developed new food offerings for both healthy dining options which were introduced in early focused on late night business through beverage and appetizer innovation and local restaurant marketing efforts around sports and holiday events and developed and tested a guest driven lunch program which we launched nationally in early improve margins and unit level economics we implemented numerous initiatives to improve the operations and profitability of applebee company operated restaurants  resulting in a basis point profit margin improvement from the prior year 
the improved margins resulted from implementing cost management tools to reduce food waste and optimize hourly labor 
we continued to reap the benefits of our supply chain co op to leverage our scale to reduce food cost and cost of distribution for both franchise and company operated restaurants 
the margin improvements were not at the expense of the guest as we achieved system wide all time high guest satisfaction scores 
we continue to monitor our franchisees through our franchisee operations rating system which provides visibility concerning their performance in relation to guest experience  food safety and training 
transform the business in june  we rolled out connections  the new comprehensive restaurant revitalization program involving people  place and promotional aspects 
the people aspect involves re training and re certification for kitchen staff and team members 
the place aspect involves exterior and interior modifications to the restaurant to signal change 
the promotional aspect involves a local public relations and marketing plan to re connect with the neighborhood 
in  restaurants in the system were revitalized under this program 
during  we franchised an additional company operated restaurants in minnesota  wisconsin and virginia 
additionally  in january and february of we franchised company owned restaurants in missouri  illinois and virginia 
the company remains committed to our strategy to franchise a substantial majority of the company operated restaurants to buyers who are financially qualified  share our vision for revitalizing the applebee brand  are willing to invest in the business  and have well qualified management teams 
we have the financial flexibility to meet our obligations without additional refranchising transactions  so we will only pursue transactions that make economic sense 
we anticipate that reaching our goal of franchise operated restaurants will take several years to complete 
this heavily franchised business model is expected to require less capital investment  
table of contents improve margins and reduce the volatility of cash flow performance over time  while also providing cash proceeds from the franchising of the restaurants for the retirement of debt 
in a challenging economic environment and a highly competitive casual dining category  there can be no assurance that the strategies described above  when implemented  will achieve the intended results  including the franchising of the remaining applebee domestic company operated restaurants  within the time frames described above 
ihop key strategies we pursue growth through a three part strategic framework energize the ihop brand  improve operations performance  and maximize franchise development 
energize the ihop brand we seek to energize our brand by continuing our come hungry 
leave happy 
advertising campaign 
this message has successfully resonated with our guests for almost eight years 
in  we also initiated the strategy of limited time offers on promotional products 
since that time  we have enhanced our execution of this promotional product approach by improving the appeal and the franchisees execution of these promotions 
in addition  we seek to enhance our media strategies to emphasize national advertising on broadcast  cable and syndicated television and strengthen our product promotion process 
over the last three years  we have shifted the allocation of our media spending towards national advertising 
due to this reallocation from local to national advertising  in we were able to provide continuous media support for all national initiatives  such as limited time offers  and secondary messages  such as ihop for dinner  gift cards and kids eat free 
in  we launched the next phase of our remodel program to capture energy and innovation necessary to keep the ihop brand relevant  dynamic and enticing 
we also expanded our gift card program by increasing our third party retailer base to market our gift cards in as well as now offer our gift cards through a national scrip program allowing an additional presence at over  non profit organizations across the united states 
in we successfully launched an e club enabling both national and local offers to be sent electronically to our guests that sign up for the program 
improve operations performance we intend to continue to improve the operations of the restaurants 
during  we established an ihop franchisee grading system to evaluate the operational standards of each of our restaurant units 
this franchisee grading system is a comprehensive scorecard that covers mystery shop scores  operational assessment scores and health department ratings  among other things 
during  ihop moved to the next level of guest feedback from the current process of mystery shop to a voice of the guest program which provides real time guest feedback to the operators and the brand 
in  of all franchisees received grades of a or b for their restaurants 
in addition  we intend to continue focusing on making exceptional service a priority for franchisees by providing tools for improved restaurant execution  while highlighting our motto service as good as our pancakes 
substantially all ihop restaurants are using pollable point of sale systems to capture and report a broad range of sales and product mix data 
this information is used by management to  among other things  to gauge guest acceptance of menu items and the success of promotions and limited time offers 
maximize franchise development under the current business model  ihop seeks to maximize franchise development by emphasizing the recruitment of franchise developers within and outside the current system in order to grow its revenues 
this strategy has proven very successful as we have developed approximately restaurants since the inception of the current business model and we have a pipeline of 
table of contents additional new restaurants committed  optioned or pending 
the strong existing franchisee base accounts for over of these future obligations 
in addition  we may take steps to consolidate and rehabilitate existing markets if we believe that doing so is advisable in order to fully realize development potential 
in a challenging economic environment and a highly competitive family dining category  there can be no assurance that the strategies described above  when implemented  will achieve the intended results within the time frame anticipated 
significant known events  trends or uncertainties impacting or expected to impact comparisons of reported or future results refinancing of indebtedness in october  we effected a series of transactions that culminated in the refinancing of our remaining billion of securitized indebtedness the october refinancing and the redemption of our series a perpetual preferred stock series a stock  both of which had been issued to finance our acquisition of applebee 
the october refinancing replaced securitized debt that had an anticipated repayment date of with a million senior secured credit facility due in and million of senior notes due in the redemption of the series a stock eliminated high coupon dividend payments on the series a stock that were not deductible for tax purposes 
in february  we entered into an amendment that reduces the interest rate pricing for borrowings under our senior secured credit facility 
these transactions are discussed in further detail under liquidity and capital resources below 
current economic conditions while published economic data suggests both personal disposable income and consumer confidence improved during  we believe the countervailing effects of high levels of unemployment and home foreclosures in addition to lower overall valuations for residential real estate will continue to put pressure on consumer spending 
a continued decline or lack of growth in disposable income for discretionary spending could cause our customers to change historic purchasing behavior and choose lower cost dining options or alternatives to dining out 
these factors could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
sales trends domestic same restaurant percentage sales change q q q q q q q q applebee quarter ytd ihop quarter ytd applebee domestic system wide same restaurant sales increased and for the fourth quarter and year ended december   respectively 
this marked the first year of positive same restaurant sales subsequent to the november acquisition of applebee 
further  this was the fifth consecutive quarter in which either the decline in same restaurant sales was less than the decline in the preceding quarter or  as was the case in the third and fourth quarters of  reflected an increase in same restaurant sales 
in light of the potential impact of economic uncertainties on discretionary consumer spending  there can be no assurance that the trend of improvement and overall positive performance will continue 

table of contents ihop domestic system wide same restaurant sales for the year ended december  were essentially flat compared with the prior year 
while domestic system wide same restaurant sales increased in the third and fourth quarters in contrast to decreases in the first and second quarters  we do not believe this constitutes a discernable trend 
fifty three week fiscal year our fiscal year ends on the sunday nearest to december of each year 
as a result  every five or six years our fiscal year contains calendar weeks 
fiscal and each contained weeks  whereas fiscal contained weeks 
the estimated impact on fiscal of the rd week in fiscal was an increase in revenue of million  an increase in segment profit of million and an increase in income before income taxes of million 
while certain expenses increased in direct relationship to additional revenue from the rd week  other costs for example  depreciation and other fixed costs are recorded on a calendar month basis 
therefore  the impact of the additional week is not necessarily indicative of a typical relationship of expenses to revenues measured over a longer period of comparison  such as a fiscal month or a fiscal quarter 
significant gains and charges there were several significant gains and charges that affect the comparisons of fiscal year results with previously reported periods  as presented in the following table year ended december  in millions impairment and closure charges loss gain on extinguishment of debt and temporary equity gain loss on disposition of assets each transaction is discussed in further detail under paragraphs captioned with those descriptions elsewhere in item while impairment and closure charges in were significantly lower than in the two previous years  our fixed and intangible assets including goodwill must be assessed continually for indicators of impairment 
given the uncertainty as to future economic and other assumptions used in assessing impairments  it is possible that significant impairment charges may occur in future periods 
prior to the october refinancing  our debt traded at less than its carrying value such that early retirement by purchases on the open market resulted in significant gains 
the fair value of our current debt instruments is currently greater than its carrying value see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
therefore  while we may dedicate a portion of excess cash flow towards early debt retirement  we do not anticipate recognizing gains on the extinguishment of debt 
financial statement effect of franchising company operated restaurants as of december   we have franchised applebee company operated restaurants since the second quarter of and have signed agreements to franchise an additional restaurants 
the sale of restaurants in the st 
louis market closed in january and the sale of of the washington  dc restaurants closed in february the sale of the one remaining washington  dc restaurant is expected to close before the end of the second fiscal quarter of we are planning to franchise a significant majority of the remaining company operated applebee over the next several years 
as the number of company operated restaurants declines  the amount of company restaurant revenues and company restaurant expenses in future periods will decline significantly compared to amounts reported in previous periods 
franchise royalty revenues and expenses will likely increase as company operated restaurants are franchised  although not in the same magnitude as the 
table of contents company restaurant revenues decline as franchise royalties are based on a percentage of the franchisee revenues 
as the number of applebee company operated restaurants declines we anticipate that general and administrative expenses associated with managing these restaurants will decline as well 
additionally  under terms of our debt instruments  all of the proceeds from asset sales subject to certain exceptions must be used to retire long term debt  which would result in a decrease in interest expense in the future 
restaurant data the following table sets forth  for each of the past three years  the number of effective restaurants in the applebee and ihop systems and information regarding the percentage change in sales at those restaurants compared to the same period in the prior year 
effective restaurants are the number of restaurants in a given period  adjusted to account for restaurants open for only a portion of the period 
information is presented for all effective restaurants in the applebee and ihop systems  which includes company operated restaurants  as well as those operated by franchisees and area licensees 
sales of restaurants that are operated by franchisees and area licensees are not attributable to the company 
however  we believe that presentation of this information is useful in analyzing our revenues because franchisees and area licensees pay us royalties and advertising fees that are generally based on a percentage of their sales  as well as  in some cases  rental payments under leases that are usually based on a percentage of their sales 
management also uses this information to make decisions about future plans for the development of additional restaurants as well as evaluation of current operations

same restaurant sales were effectively unchanged from as a higher average guest check was offset by a decline in guest traffic 
the company believes that the decline experienced in comparable guest traffic is reflective of the current adverse economic conditions affecting customers and impacting the restaurant industry as a whole 
the decrease in applebee franchise expenses was primarily due to costs associated with revenues from temporary liquor license agreements in that did not recur 
the revenues and expenses related to the temporary liquor license agreements did not result in any significant segment profit in the increase in ihop franchise expenses was due to the costs of sales associated with the increased revenues from franchise advertising fees and higher bad debt expense  partially offset by lower costs of pancake and waffle dry mix sales

a decrease in domestic same restaurant sales of and the closure of seven restaurants in were responsible for the rest of the decline 
the change in same restaurant sales was driven mainly by a decline in guest traffic that was partially offset by a slightly higher average guest check

stock based compensation costs increased primarily due to the acceleration of expenses due to changes resulting from vesting of certain equity grants to directors and the retirement of an executive and the impact of a higher stock price on equity grants accounted for as liabilities 
the increase in salaries and benefits is primarily due to an increase in managers and related training costs and the filling of open positions at applebee

impairment and closure charges impairment and closure charges for the years ended december  and were as follows year ended december  in millions tradename impairment long lived tangible asset impairment closure charges total impairment and closure charges goodwill in accordance with u 
s gaap  goodwill must be evaluated for impairment  at a minimum  on an annual basis  and more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist 
such indicators include  but are not limited to  events or circumstances such as a significant adverse change in the business climate  unanticipated competition  a loss of key personnel  adverse legal or regulatory developments  or a significant decline in the market price of our common stock 
in the process of the annual impairment review  we primarily use the income approach method of valuation that uses a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of reporting units 
significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model include future trends in sales  operating expenses  overhead expenses  depreciation  capital expenditures  and changes in working capital  along with an appropriate discount rate 
during the course of fiscal and we made periodic assessments as to whether there were indicators of impairment  particularly with respect to the significant assumptions underlying the discounted cash flow model 
in each year we determined an interim test of goodwill was not warranted 
accordingly  we performed the annual test of goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter of and in performing the first step of the impairment test  the estimated fair value of both the ihop and applebee franchised restaurant units exceeded their respective carrying values and we concluded there was no impairment of goodwill in either or 
table of contents tradename impairment in accordance with us gaap  indefinite lived intangible assets must be evaluated for impairment  at a minimum  on an annual basis  and more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist 
such indicators include  but are not limited to  events or circumstances such as a significant adverse change in the business climate  unanticipated competition  a loss of key personnel  adverse legal or regulatory developments  or a significant decline in the market price of our common stock 
in performing the impairment review of the tradename intangible asset  we primarily use the relief of royalty method under the income approach method of valuation 
significant assumptions used to determine fair value under the relief of royalty method include future trends in sales  a royalty rate and a discount rate to be applied to the forecast revenue stream 
during the course of fiscal and  we made periodic assessments as to whether there were indicators of impairment  particularly with respect to the significant assumptions noted above 
as a result of these assessments  we determined an interim test of indefinite lived intangibles was not necessary in either or during the fourth quarter of  we performed the annual test of impairment for indefinite lived intangibles  primarily the applebee tradename assigned in the purchase price allocation 
we determined the estimated fair value of our indefinite lived intangible assets exceeded the carrying values and in the absence of other indicators of impairment we concluded no impairment was necessary 
during the fourth quarter of  we performed the annual test of impairment for indefinite lived intangibles 
as the result of the test  the estimated fair value of the tradename was less than the carrying value and an impairment of million was recognized  along with a related tax benefit of million 
long lived tangible asset impairment and closure costs on a quarterly basis  we assess whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that potentially indicate the carrying value of tangible long lived assets  primarily assets related to company operated restaurants  may not be recoverable 
recoverability of a restaurant assets is measured by comparing the assets carrying value to the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated over the assets remaining useful lives or remaining lease terms  whichever is less 
if the total expected undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets  this may be an indicator of impairment 
if it is decided that there has been an impairment  the carrying amount of the asset is written down to the estimated fair value 
the fair value is primarily determined by discounting the future cash flows based on our cost of capital 
as the result of performing these assessments throughout  we recognized impairments of long lived tangible assets of million 
in october we sold company operated applebee restaurants located in minnesota and wisconsin 
we had fee ownership of the properties on which three of the restaurants were located 
our strategy does not contemplate retaining such properties as a lessor on a long term basis

we also placed a single restaurant and the land on which it is situated up for sale

other minor impairments totaled million 
closure charges in of million related primarily to two company operated ihop cafe restaurants a non traditional restaurant test format that was evaluated but will no longer be utilized and to the closure of a company operated applebee restaurant in china

we had fee ownership of the properties on which four applebee company operated restaurants were located 
these restaurants were franchised in the fourth quarter of but we retained ownership of the land and continued to lease the property to the franchisee 
our strategy does not contemplate retaining such properties as a lessor on a long term basis 
during the third quarter of  we determined the properties met the requirements under us gaap to be reclassified as assets held for sale 
the properties were written down to the estimated fair value that will be received upon sale 
we evaluated the causal factors of all impairments of long lived assets as they were recorded during and and concluded they were based on factors specific to each asset and were not potential indicators of an impairment of goodwill  indefinite lived intangible assets or other long lived assets 
closure costs of million related to two ihop franchise restaurants 
loss gain on extinguishment of debt and temporary equity in  we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt and temporary equity of million compared with a gain on extinguishment of debt of million in the loss in was comprised of charges of million resulting from the october refinancing and the redemption of series a stock and a million loss on extinguishment of debt subsequent to the october refinancing  partially offset by gains on extinguishment of debt of million 
the charges consisted of approximately million of deferred financing costs associated with our previous securitized debt structure  including the remaining balance in accumulated other comprehensive income of a loss related to an interest rate swap designated as a cash flow hedge  and approximately million of prepayment costs and tender premiums associated with the retirement of the securitized debt 
tender premiums associated with the series a stock were included as dividends paid and not part of the loss on extinguishment 
during prior to the october refinancing and  we recognized the following gains on the early retirement of debt transaction date instrument face amount retired cash paid gain in millions march class a ii x june class a ii x total march  class a ii x may  class a ii a june  class a ii x november  class a ii x december  class a ii x total after write off of the discount and deferred financing costs related to the debt retired 
we may continue to dedicate a portion of excess cash flow towards opportunistic debt retirement 
however  our debt no longer trades at a discount to face value  therefore future retirements will most likely result in a loss on retirement due to the write off of the discount and deferred financing costs related to the debt retired

labor costs as a percentage of restaurant sales benefited from a reduction in management incentive expense due to retention costs in that did not recur  improvements in hourly labor from effective wage rate management and improved productivity  and lower group insurance costs

s gaap  goodwill must be evaluated for impairment  at a minimum  on an annual basis  and more frequently if the company believes indicators of impairment exist 
such indicators include  but are not limited to  events or circumstances such as a significant adverse change in the business climate  unanticipated competition  a loss of key personnel  adverse legal or regulatory developments  or a significant decline in the market price of the company common stock 
in the process of the annual impairment review  we primarily use the income approach method of valuation that uses a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of reporting units 
significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model include future trends in sales  operating expenses  overhead expenses  depreciation  capital expenditures  and changes in working capital  along with an appropriate discount rate 
during the course of fiscal  we made periodic assessments as to whether there were indicators of impairment  particularly with respect to the significant assumptions underlying the discounted cash flow model  and determined an interim test of goodwill was not warranted 
accordingly  we performed the annual test of goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter of in performing the test  the company revised downwards the same restaurant sales change assumption in its five year forecast that had been used in the prior year 
the company also revised downward the assumed discount rate 
in performing the first step of the impairment test  the estimated fair value of both the ihop and applebee franchised restaurant units exceeded their respective carrying values and it was concluded there was no impairment of goodwill 
the goodwill that had been allocated to the applebee company operated restaurants unit was fully impaired in a significant majority of our goodwill arose from the november  acquisition of applebee  million of goodwill resulted from a prior transaction related to the ihop franchised restaurants unit 
we allocated the goodwill from the acquisition to two reporting units  the applebee company operated restaurants unit the applebee company unit and the applebee franchised restaurants unit applebee franchise unit 
consistent with our intent to franchise the significant majority of the company operated applebee restaurants acquired  we determined the fair value of the applebee company unit for purposes of assigning goodwill to be the estimated sales value of the restaurants  the value that a market participant would have paid to purchase the restaurants on the day following the acquisition 
the fair value of the applebee company unit was based on a multiple of 
table of contents approximately six times the operating cash flow for the trailing twelve months of the applebee company unit 
this multiple was supported by actual refranchising transactions negotiated within a month after the acquisition 
the fair value of the franchise unit was determined using a discounted cash flow based on forecast royalty revenues from the franchise operations 
these fair values  which reconciled to the overall purchase price paid to acquire applebee  were then used to assign goodwill between the reporting units as the excess of the estimated fair value over the carrying value as of november  of each reporting unit 
during the course of fiscal  we made periodic assessments as to whether there were indicators of impairment  particularly with respect to the significant assumptions underlying the discounted cash flow model 
those assessments included consideration of the uncertainty with respect to the depth and duration of the economic slowdown and the timing of a recovery  and the fact that the company was in the process of implementing several initiatives designed to improve applebee same restaurant sales and margin performance 
these assessments concluded that the sales forecasts being used to assess potential impairment were achievable within ranges that did not indicate impairment 
we therefore determined an interim test of goodwill during the first three quarters of was not warranted 
in the fourth quarter of  we performed the annual test for impairment of goodwill  utilizing a discounted cash flow model of the income approach as described above 
the impairment test of goodwill of the two applebee units was performed as of october  the impairment test of the goodwill of the ihop unit ihop unit was performed as of december   the date as of which the analysis has been performed in prior years 
towards the latter part of  while there was still considerable uncertainty with respect to the economic slowdown  the prevailing view was that a recovery was not likely to begin until the latter half of or early therefore  during the fourth quarter of  we revised downward our forecasted sales assumption for which also impacted the assumed cash flows for both and the following time period due to an assumed lower base from which the time period had originally been projected 
we also revised our projections with respect to both the estimated timing and estimated proceeds to be received from the franchising of applebee company operated restaurants 
the first step of the impairment test compared the fair value of each of our reporting units to their carrying value 
based on this first step  we concluded that the fair value of the ihop unit and the applebee franchise unit was in excess of their respective net carrying values and no impairment of goodwill was warranted 
however  because of downward revisions to the sales forecast and to franchising proceeds  the fair value of the applebee company unit was less than the net carrying value of its assets assigned  requiring the second step of the impairment test 
in performing the second step of the impairment test we concluded that the goodwill allocated to the applebee company unit was fully impaired and an impairment charge of million was recorded 
no tax benefit was associated with the impairment of goodwill 
subsequent to the annual test of impairment as of october   the commercial real estate market continued to weaken  the credit markets continued constrained  economic forecasts were uncertain as to how long the recessionary period would last  and the company stock price declined 
we concluded an interim test of goodwill of the applebee franchise unit was warranted 
we again revised the significant assumptions underlying the discounted cash flow model and updated our impairment analysis of the applebee franchise unit as of december  the company determined the fair value of the applebee franchise unit was still in excess of its carrying value as of december  and no impairment was required 

table of contents tradename impairment in accordance with us gaap  indefinite lived intangible assets must be evaluated for impairment  at a minimum  on an annual basis  and more frequently if the company believes indicators of impairment exist 
such indicators include  but are not limited to  events or circumstances such as a significant adverse change in the business climate  unanticipated competition  a loss of key personnel  adverse legal or regulatory developments  or a significant decline in the market price of the company common stock 
in performing the impairment review of the tradename intangible asset  the company primarily uses the relief of royalty method under the income approach method of valuation 
significant assumptions used to determine fair value under the relief of royalty method include future trends in sales  a royalty rate and a discount rate to be applied to the forecast revenue stream 
during the course of fiscal  the company made periodic assessments as to whether there were indicators of impairment  particularly with respect to the significant assumptions noted above 
in the first half of the year  same restaurant sales trends were within the range of the forecast used in the assessment 
during the third quarter of  same restaurant sales trended below the forecast range  however  during there were also indications that a lessening of underlying risk might result in a lower discount rate as well 
as a result of these assessments  the company determined an interim test of indefinite lived intangibles was not necessary 
during the fourth quarter of  the company performed the annual test of impairment for indefinite lived intangibles  primarily the applebee tradename assigned in the purchase price allocation 
the company revised downwards two key assumptions in its five year forecast the same restaurant sales change and the assumed discount rate 
all other assumptions used in the relief from royalty calculation were unchanged from the prior year 
as the result of the revised assumptions  the estimated fair value of the tradename was less than the carrying value and an impairment of million was recognized  along with a related tax benefit of million 
during the fourth quarter of  the company performed an impairment test of its indefinite lived intangible assets  primarily the applebee tradename assigned in the purchase price allocation 
we utilized the relief from royalty method under the income approach to determine the fair value of the tradename 
we determined the fair value of the tradename as of december  was less than the carrying value 
an impairment charge of million was recorded with a tax benefit of million associated with the charge 
long lived tangible asset impairment and closure charges on a quarterly basis  the company assesses whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that potentially indicate the carrying value of tangible long lived assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of a restaurant assets is measured by comparing the assets carrying value to the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated over the assets remaining useful life or remaining lease term  whichever is less 
if the total expected undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets  this may be an indicator of impairment 
if it is decided that there has been an impairment  the carrying amount of the asset is written down to the estimated fair value 
the fair value is determined by discounting the future cash flows based on our cost of capital 
in performing these assessments throughout  the company recognized impairments of long lived tangible assets of million 
the impaired assets comprised three ihop company operated restaurants  various assets related to one ihop franchise restaurant  one applebee company operated restaurant  a write down to the estimated sales value based on a current letter of intent of one applebee restaurant that had been closed in a prior period and included in assets held for sale as of december  and four parcels of applebee real estate 
the company had fee ownership of the properties on which four applebee company operated restaurants were located 
these restaurants were franchised in the fourth quarter of but the company retained ownership 
table of contents of the land and continued to lease the property to the franchisee 
the company strategy does not contemplate retaining such properties as a lessor on a long term basis 
during the third quarter of  the company determined the properties met the requirements under us gaap to be reclassified as assets held for sale 
the properties were written down to the estimated fair value that will be received upon sale 
the company evaluated the causal factors of all impairments of long lived assets as they were recorded during and concluded they were based on factors specific to each asset and were not potential indicators of an impairment of goodwill  indefinite lived intangible assets or other long lived assets 
closure costs of million related to two ihop franchise restaurants 
in june  the company entered into a sale leaseback transaction relating to parcels of real estate comprising land  buildings and improvements 
the net book value of the real estate exceeded the proceeds received by million 
all of the parcels involved in the transactions had been acquired in the november  acquisition of applebee and their estimated fair value was assigned as part of the purchase price allocation as of that date 
the company evaluated events subsequent to november  and noted a deterioration in both the domestic real estate and credit markets between the date of the purchase price allocation and the june closing date of the sale leaseback transactions 
in the absence of objective evidence to the contrary  the company concluded that the estimated fair value of the real estate determined in the purchase price allocation had been reasonable  and the decline in value related primarily to market events subsequent to the acquisition date necessitating an impairment charge as opposed to an adjustment to the allocated purchase price 
the company evaluated whether this charge  in addition to other macroeconomic data and the decline in the market price of the company common stock  were indicators of potential impairment of its goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets 
the company concluded that they were not indicators  because i the impairment charge was related to a specific transaction that resulted in the disposal of the majority of the company real estate  ii applebee june  year to date same restaurant sales for company operated stores had increased slightly compared with the same period of the prior year  iii while directionally the united states economy was slowing down  there was considerable uncertainty as to the depth and duration of the slowdown  such that the company believed its internal forecasts of same restaurant sales growth were achievable  and iv the company net book value was in excess of its market capitalization throughout the period up to and including the date of filing its form q for the quarterly period ending june  as part of the ongoing assessment of the recoverability of its long lived assets  the company recorded impairment charges of million for the three month period ended september  of that amount  million related to applebee properties and primarily resulted from a continuing deterioration in credit markets in general and a decline in operating results of applebee company operated restaurants expected to be franchised in particular geographic areas 
the remainder of the impairment related to an individual underperforming ihop property whose estimates of future cash flows indicated that the carrying value would not be recovered 
the company again evaluated whether the impairment charges taken in the third quarter of  in addition to other macroeconomic data and the decline in the market price of the company common stock  were an indicator of potential impairment of its goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets 
the company concluded that they were not an indicator  because i the impairments were related to specific transactions in three geographic markets characterized as having a larger proportion of underperforming restaurants than the other geographic markets in which the remaining company operated restaurants are located  ii while applebee year to date september  same restaurant sales for company operated stores had decreased slightly compared with the same period of the prior year  the company was in the process of implementing several initiatives designed to improve the same restaurant sales and did not believe there had been enough time to adequately assess the effectiveness of those initiatives  iii while economic data confirmed that the united states economy had been recessionary since december of  there was still considerable uncertainty as to 
table of contents the depth and duration of the slowdown  and although applebee year to date same restaurant sales were lower than the prior period  applebee decline had been less than its competitors  such that the company believed its internal forecasts of same restaurant sales growth were achievable  and iv the company net book value was in excess of its market capitalization throughout the third quarter ended september   and while the market capitalization did decline below the company net book value subsequent to september   by the october  date of filing its form q for the quarterly period ending september   the company net book value was in excess of its market capitalization 
gain on extinguishment of debt during and  we recognized the following gains on the early retirement of debt transaction date instrument face amount retired cash paid gain in millions march  class a ii x may  class a ii a june  class a ii x november  class a ii x december  class a ii x total august  class a ii x october  class a ii x total after write off of the discount and deferred financing costs related to the debt retired 
the company may continue to dedicate a portion of excess cash flow towards opportunistic debt retirement 
however  the difference between the face amount of debt retired and the amount we have paid has decreased over time and it is likely that gains on future extinguishments of debt  as a percentage of the face amount retired  will be smaller than the average gain recognized in and  if they occur at all 
gain loss on disposition of assets the company recognized a gain on disposition of assets of million in  primarily related to the franchising of seven applebee restaurants in the new mexico market and sale of a parcel of land held by ihop 
other expense income in  other items of income and expense netted to an expense of million compared to income of million in the primary reason for the change was lower interest income resulting from significantly lower interest rates on united states treasury based investments 
income tax provision benefit we recognized a tax expense of million in as compared to a tax benefit of million in the change was primarily due to the increase in our pretax book income 
the effective tax rate of applied to pretax book income was lower than the statutory federal tax rate of primarily due to tax credits and changes in tax rates  state tax laws and unrecognized tax benefits  partially offset by state income taxes and changes in the tax asset valuation allowance 
the tax credits are primarily fica tip and other compensation related tax credits associated with applebee company owned restaurant operations and credits associated with the applebee restaurant support center in lenexa  kansas 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources of the company we incurred approximately billion of securitized indebtedness in connection with the acquisition of applebee  of which approximately billion remained outstanding as of october  this indebtedness had an accelerated repayment date of  subject to certain short term extensions 
credit facilities on october   we entered into a credit agreement with a group of lenders and financial institutions the credit agreement that established a senior secured credit facility the senior secured credit facility consisting of a million term facility the term facility maturing in october and a million senior secured revolving credit facility the revolving facility maturing in october loans made under the term facility and the revolving facility will bear interest  at our option  at an annual rate equal to i a libor based rate which will be subject to a floor of plus a margin of or ii the base rate the base rate which will be subject to a floor of  which will be equal to the highest of a the federal funds rate plus  b the prime rate and c the one month libor rate which will be subject to a floor of plus  plus a margin of

the margin for the revolving facility is subject to debt leverage based step downs 
the revolving facility is utilized  among other purposes  to collateralize certain letters of credit we are required to maintain that were previously collateralized with restricted cash 
such collateralization does not constitute a draw down under the revolving facility but does reduce the amount that can be borrowed under the revolving facility 
unused amounts of the revolving facility bear interest at the rate of basis points per annum 
as of december   no amounts were borrowed under the revolving facility and approximately million in letters of credit were collateralized by the revolving facility 
the credit agreement also provides for an uncommitted incremental facility that permits the company  subject to certain conditions  to increase the senior secured credit facility by up to million  provided that the aggregate amount of the commitments under the revolving facility may not exceed million 
october refinancing on october   we completed a refinancing of our billion of securitized indebtedness using the following sources of funds we borrowed million under the term facility  and we issued million of senior unsecured notes the notes at par that will mature in october with a coupon of per annum 
interest on the company bonds is payable in the months of april and october of each year  beginning in april these borrowings  along with cash on hand not required for operating needs and previously restricted cash becoming available concurrently with the retirement of the securitized debt totaled approximately billion

the amendment to the credit agreement 
pursuant to the amendment  the interest rate margin applicable to libor based loans under the term facility was reduced from to  and the interest rate floors used to determine the libor and base rate reference rates for loans under the term facility were reduced from to for libor based loans and from to for base rate denominated loans 
in addition  the amendment increased the available lender commitments under the revolving facility from million to million 
no amounts under the revolving facility were drawn as of february  the amendment also modified certain restrictive covenants of the credit agreement  including those relating to repurchases of other debt securities  permitted acquisitions and payments on equity 
the amendment was included as exhibit of our current report on form k filed on february  as a result of the october refinancing and the amendment  we anticipate our cash interest expense on indebtedness will be approximately million  based on the debt balances outstanding as of february  and current interest rates  a decrease of million  or million after tax  from this decrease  in addition to the elimination of approximately million in non deductible preferred stock dividend payments on the series a stock will result in a favorable impact from the october refinancing and the amendment on our liquidity and fixed charges of approximately million

mandatory repayments loans under the credit agreement are subject to the following repayment requirements per year of principal balance  of excess cash flow as defined in the credit agreement  paid  at a minimum  on an annual basis  and of asset sales and insurance proceeds subject to certain exclusions 
we may voluntarily prepay loans under both the term facility and the revolving facility without premium or penalty 
however  if we make a voluntary prepayment within one year after the closing date of the credit agreement in the case of the revolving facility  or one year after the february refinancing in the case of the term facility  in any such case connection with any transaction that results in a lower effective interest rate as described above  we must pay a prepayment premium in an amount equal to of the principal amount prepaid  as applicable 
there are no mandatory repayments of the notes  although under certain conditions we may be required to repurchase notes with excess proceeds of assets sales or upon a change of control  as described in the indenture under which the notes were issued 
debt covenants pursuant to the credit agreement we will be required to comply with a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated cash interest coverage ratio  beginning with the first quarter of at that time  the company required maximum consolidated leverage ratio of total debt net of unrestricted cash not to exceed million to adjusted ebitda  on a trailing four quarter basis  will be x 
our required minimum ratio of adjusted ebitda to consolidated cash interest  on a trailing four quarter basis  will be x 
these thresholds become more rigorous over time 
the maximum consolidated leverage ratio will decline  in annual basis point decrements  to x by the first quarter of  then to x for the first quarter of until the credit agreement expires in october the minimum consolidated cash interest coverage ratio will increase to x commencing in the first quarter of and to x commencing in the first quarter of and remain at that level until the credit agreement expires in october there are no financial maintenance covenants associated with the notes 
as noted above  we are not required to certify compliance with the maximum consolidated leverage ratio and minimum consolidated cash interest coverage ratio covenants until delivery of the financial statements for the quarter ended march  for the year ended december  our consolidated leverage ratio was x and our consolidated cash interest coverage ratio was x

franchising of applebee company operated restaurants during  we completed the franchising of company operated applebee restaurants in the minnesota wisconsin market and company operated applebee restaurants in the roanoke lynchburg markets in the state of virginia 
proceeds from asset dispositions  including the restaurants  totaled million for the twelve months ended december   the majority of which was used to redeem series a stock and retire debt 
since the applebee acquisition we have pursued a strategy to transition from the franchised applebee system at the time of the acquisition to an approximately franchised applebee system  similar to ihop franchised system 
as of december   we have franchised applebee company operated restaurants since the second quarter of subsequent to december  we franchised restaurants in the st 
louis market in january and of restaurants in the washington  dc market in february   the sale of the one remaining washington  dc restaurant is expected to close before the end of the second fiscal quarter of including the restaurants franchised in the first quarter of  the applebee system is approximately franchised we are planning to franchise a significant majority of the remaining company operated applebee over the next several years while retaining part of the kansas city area as a company market 
this heavily franchised business model is expected to require less capital investment  improve margins and reduce the volatility of cash flow performance over time  while also providing cash proceeds from the franchising of the restaurants for the retirement of debt 
under the terms of the credit agreement  all of the proceeds of future asset dispositions must be used to repay borrowings under the term facility and under certain conditions  we may be required to repurchase notes with excess proceeds of assets sales  as defined in the indenture under which the notes were issued 

table of contents cash flows in summary  our cash flows were as follows in millions net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by investing activities net cash used in financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities cash provided by operating activities is primarily driven by revenues earned and collected from our franchisees  operating earnings from our company operated restaurants and profit from our rental operations and financing operations 
franchise revenues consist of royalties  ihop advertising fees and sales of proprietary products for ihop  each of which fluctuates with increases or decreases in franchise retail sales 
franchise retail sales are impacted by the development of ihop and applebee restaurants by our franchisees and by fluctuations in same restaurant sales 
operating earnings from company operated restaurants are impacted by many factors which include but are not limited to changes in traffic patterns  pricing activities and changes in operating expenses 
rental operations profit is rental income less rental expenses 
rental income includes revenues from operating leases and interest income from direct financing leases 
rental expenses are costs of prime operating leases and interest expense on prime capital leases on franchisee operated restaurants 
financing operations revenue consists of the portion of franchise fees not allocated to ihop intellectual property  sales of equipment  as well as interest income from the financing of franchise fees and equipment leases 
financing expenses are primarily the cost of restaurant equipment 
cash provided by operating activities totaled million during the months ended december  compared to million in the same period in net income declined million  however  this was offset by an increase of million in noncash adjustments primarily losses on debt extinguishment  depreciation  non cash interest  gains on asset sales  deferred taxes and impairment charges 
working capital changes used cash of million during compared to a million use in the decrease in working capital used was due primarily to an increase in interest payable and the timing of payments for advertising  partially offset by an increase in income tax receivables that was primarily due to the income tax benefits associated with the loss recognized in the october refinancing 
cash paid for interest in was million as compared to million in investing activities net cash provided by investing activities in was primarily attributable to million of proceeds from dispositions of assets  primarily the franchising of applebee company operated restaurants  and million of principal receipts from notes  equipment contracts and other long term receivables  partially offset by million of capital expenditures 
capital expenditures increased from million in due primarily to increases in information technology infrastructure expenditures and remodeling of company operated restaurants 
capital expenditures are expected to be approximately million in fiscal the increase from is primarily due to expectation for the remodeling of additional company operated restaurants 

table of contents the following table represents the principal receipts on various receivables due from our franchisees as of december  principal receipts due by period thereafter total in millions equipment leases direct financing leases franchise notes and other total equipment lease receivables extend through the year direct financing lease receivables extend through the year franchise note receivables extend through the year financing activities financing activities used net cash of million during cash used in financing activities primarily consisted of  million in repayments of long term debt  payment of debt issuance costs of million  redemption of series a stock of million and million in dividend payments including million of redemption premiums on series a stock 
of the long term debt repayments   million was related to the october refinancing including tender premiums  million related to early retirement of securitization debt with excess cash prior to the october refinancing  million of debt retirements subsequent to the october refinancing and million related to scheduled repayments of debt prior to the october refinancing  capital leases and financing obligations 
cash provided by financing activities primarily came from borrowing million under the term facility  issuing million of senior notes and the release of million in restricted cash related to the old securitization debt 
share repurchases and dividends there is currently no authorized or publicly announced plan to repurchase our common stock 
we do  from time to time  repurchase shares owned and tendered by employees to satisfy tax withholding obligations on the vesting of restricted stock awards 
such shares are purchased at the closing price of our common stock on the vesting date 
currently  we do not pay a dividend on our common stock 
under our current debt agreements  we are restricted from paying dividends on common stock until certain financial ratios are achieved 
those ratios have not been achieved as of december  at such time as those financial ratios are achieved  dividend payments on common stock may be resumed at the discretion of the board of directors after consideration of the company earnings  financial condition  cash requirements  future prospects and other factors 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a of sec regulation s k 

table of contents contractual obligations and commitments the following are our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations year years years more than years total in millions debt financing obligation operating leases capital leases purchase commitments other obligations total minimum payments less interest at december   we had a reserve for unrecognized tax benefit including potential interest and penalties  net of related tax benefit  totaling million  of which approximately million is expected to be paid within one year 
for the remaining liability  due to the uncertainties related to these tax matters  we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of when settlements with a taxing authority will occur 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses in the reporting period 
we base our estimates and assumptions on current facts  historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
accounting assumptions and estimates are inherently uncertain and actual results may differ materially from our estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements goodwill and intangibles goodwill is recorded when the aggregate purchase price of an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired 
intangible assets resulting from the acquisition are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and are estimated by management based on the fair value of the assets received 
identifiable intangible assets are comprised primarily of trademarks  tradenames  liquor licenses  which are considered to have an indefinite life  and franchise agreements  recipes and menus  favorable lease agreements  which are considered to have a finite life 
intangible assets with finite lives are being amortized over the period of estimated benefit using the straight line method and estimated useful lives 
goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are not subject to amortization 
goodwill was allocated to three reporting units  the ihop unit  applebee company unit and applebee franchise unit 
the significant majority of the company goodwill resulted from the 
table of contents november  acquisition of applebee and has been allocated between the two applebee units 
the company tests goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter 
the annual impairment test of goodwill of the two applebee units is performed as of october of each year 
the annual impairment test of the goodwill of the ihop unit is performed as of december of each year  the date as of which the analysis has been performed in prior years 
in addition to the annual test of impairment  goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets must be evaluated more frequently if the company believes indicators of impairment exist 
such indicators include  but are not limited to  events or circumstances such as a significant adverse change in the business climate  unanticipated competition  a loss of key personnel  adverse legal or regulatory developments  or a significant decline in the market price of the company common stock 
in the process of the company annual impairment review of goodwill  the company primarily uses the income approach method of valuation that includes the discounted cash flow method as well as other generally accepted valuation methodologies to determine the fair value 
significant assumptions used to determine fair value under the discounted cash flows model include future trends in sales  operating expenses  overhead expenses  depreciation  capital expenditures  and changes in working capital along with an appropriate discount rate 
additional assumptions are made as to proceeds to be received from future franchising of company operated restaurants 
step one of the impairment test compares the fair value of each of our reporting units to its carrying value 
if the fair value is in excess of the carrying value  no impairment exists 
if the step one test does indicate an impairment  step two must take place 
under step two  the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit are estimated as if the reporting unit were acquired in a business combination 
the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the carrying amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of the goodwill  to which the carrying value of the goodwill must be adjusted 
the fair value of all reporting units is then compared to the current market value of the company common stock to determine if the fair values estimated in the impairment testing process are reasonable in light of the current market value 
in the process of the company annual impairment review of the tradename  the most significant indefinite life intangible asset  the company primarily uses the relief of royalty method under income approach method of valuation 
significant assumptions used to determine fair value under the relief of royalty method include future trends in sales  a royalty rate and a discount rate to be applied to the forecast revenue stream 
long lived assets we assess long lived and intangible assets with finite lives for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
we test impairment using historical cash flows and other relevant facts and circumstances as the primary basis for our estimates of future cash flows 
we consider factors such as the number of years the restaurant has been operated by us  sales trends  cash flow trends  remaining lease life  and other factors which apply on a case by case basis 
the analysis is performed at the individual restaurant level for indicators of permanent impairment 
recoverability of the restaurant assets is measured by comparing the assets carrying value to the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated over the assets remaining useful life or remaining lease term  whichever is less 
if the total expected undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets  the carrying amount is written down to the estimated fair value  and a loss resulting from impairment is recognized by charging to earnings 
this process requires the use of estimates and assumptions  which are subject to a high degree of judgment 
if these assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 

table of contents revenue recognition the company revenues are recorded in four categories franchise operations  company restaurant operations  rental operations and financing operations 
the franchise operations revenue consists primarily of royalty revenues  sales of proprietary ihop products  ihop advertising fees and the portion of the franchise fees allocated to the company intellectual property 
company restaurant sales are retail sales at company operated restaurants 
rental operations revenue includes revenue from operating leases and interest income from direct financing leases 
financing operations revenue consists of the portion of franchise fees not allocated to the company intellectual property and sales of equipment as well as interest income from the financing of franchise fees and equipment leases 
revenues from franchised and area licensed restaurants include royalties  continuing rent and service fees and initial franchise fees 
royalties are recognized in the period in which the sales are reported to have occurred 
continuing fees are recognized in the period earned 
initial franchise fees are recognized upon the opening of a restaurant  which is when the company has performed substantially all initial services required by the franchise agreement 
fees from development agreements are deferred and recorded into income when a restaurant under the development agreement is opened 
sales by company operated restaurants are recognized when food and beverage items are sold 
company restaurant sales are reported net of sales taxes collected from guests and the sales taxes are remitted to the appropriate taxing authorities 
in addition  the company records a liability in the period in which a gift card is issued and proceeds are received 
as gift cards are redeemed  this liability is reduced and revenue is recognized 
the company recognizes gift card breakage income on gift cards issued by applebee when the likelihood of redemption of the gift card becomes remote 
this assessment is based upon applebee historical experience with gift card redemptions 
the company does not recognize breakage income on gift cards issued by ihop because the ihop gift card program has not been in existence as long as the applebee program and does not have adequate history on which to base recognition of breakage income 
allowance for credit losses the allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing receivables  however  changes in circumstances relating to receivables may result in additional allowances in the future 
we determine the allowance based on historical experience  current payment patterns  future obligations and our assessment of the ability to pay outstanding balances 
we continually review our allowance for doubtful accounts 
past due balances and future obligations are reviewed individually for collectability 
account balances are charged against the allowance after all collection efforts have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote 
fair value measurements the company determines the fair market values of its financial assets and liabilities  as well as non financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis  based on the fair value hierarchy established in us gaap 
we measure our financial assets and liabilities using inputs from the following three levels of the fair value hierarchy 
the three levels are as follows level inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access at the measurement date 

table of contents level inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active  inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability ie  interest rates  yield curves  etc  and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means market corroborated inputs 
level includes unobservable inputs that reflect our assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
we develop these inputs based on the best information available  including our own data 
for more information on the financial instruments the company measures at fair value  see note  fair value measurements  of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
leases our restaurants are located on i sites owned by us  ii sites leased by us from third parties and iii sites owned or leased by franchisees 
at the inception of the lease  each property is evaluated to determine whether the lease will be accounted for as an operating or capital lease in accordance with the provisions of us gaap governing the accounting for leases 
the lease term used for straight line rent expense is calculated from the date we obtain possession of the leased premises through the lease termination date 
prior to january   we capitalized rent expense from possession date through construction completion and reported the related asset in property and equipment 
capitalized rent was amortized through depreciation and amortization expense over the estimated useful life of the related assets limited to the lease term 
straight line rent recorded during the preopening period construction completion through restaurant open date was recorded as expense 
commencing january   we expense rent from possession date through restaurant open date 
once a restaurant opens for business  we record straight line rent over the lease term plus contingent rent to the extent it exceeded the minimum rent obligation per the lease agreement 
we use a consistent lease term when calculating depreciation of leasehold improvements  when determining straight line rent expense and when determining classification of our leases as either operating or capital 
there is potential for variability in the rent holiday period  which begins on the possession date and ends on the restaurant open date  during which no cash rent payments are typically due under the terms of the lease 
factors that may affect the length of the rent holiday period generally relate to construction related delays 
extension of the rent holiday period due to delays in restaurant opening will result in greater preopening rent expense recognized during the rent holiday period and lesser occupancy expense during the rest of the lease term post opening 
for leases that contain rent escalations  we record the total rent payable during the lease term  as determined above  on the straight line basis over the term of the lease including the rent holiday period beginning upon our possession of the premises  and record the difference between the minimum rents paid and the straight line rent as a lease obligation 
certain leases contain provisions that require additional rental payments based upon restaurant sales volume contingent rent 
contingent rentals are accrued each period as the liabilities are incurred  in addition to the straight line rent expense noted above 
certain of our lease agreements contain tenant improvement allowances 
for purposes of recognizing incentives  we amortize the incentives over the shorter of the estimated useful life or lease term 
for tenant improvement allowances  we also record a deferred rent liability or an obligation in our non current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
management makes judgments regarding the probable term for each restaurant property lease  which can impact the classification and accounting for a lease as capital or operating  the rent holiday 
table of contents and or escalations in payment that are taken into consideration when calculating straight line rent and the term over which leasehold improvements for each restaurant are amortized 
these judgments may produce materially different amounts of depreciation  amortization and rent expense than would be reported if different assumed lease terms were used 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with us gaap governing share based payments 
accordingly  we measure stock based compensation expense at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and recognize the expense over the employee requisite service period using the straight line method 
the fair value of each employee stock option and restricted stock award is estimated on the date of grant using an option pricing model that meets certain requirements 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our share based compensation 
the black scholes model meets the requirements of us gaap 
the measurement of stock based compensation expense is based on several criteria including  but not limited to  the valuation model used and associated input factors  such as expected term of the award  stock price volatility  risk free interest rate and forfeiture rate 
these inputs are subjective and are determined using management judgment 
if differences arise between the assumptions used in determining stock based compensation expense and the actual factors which become known over time  we may change the input factors used in determining future stock based compensation expense 
any such changes could materially impact our operations in the period in which the changes are made and in subsequent periods 
income taxes we provide for income taxes based on our estimate of federal and state income tax liabilities 
our annual tax rate is based on our income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayers and respective governmental authorities 
significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions 
we review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities 
deferred tax accounting requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portions or all of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized 
this test requires projection of our taxable income into future years to determine if there will be taxable income sufficient to realize the tax assets 
the preparation of the projections requires considerable judgment and is subject to change to reflect future events and changes in the tax laws 
when we establish or reduce the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  our income tax expense will increase or decrease  respectively  in the period such determination is made 
tax contingency reserves result from our estimates of potential liabilities resulting from differences between actual and audited results 
we usually file our income tax returns several months after our fiscal year end 
all tax returns are subject to audit by federal and state governments  usually years after the returns are filed  and could be subject to differing interpretation of the tax laws 
changes in the tax contingency reserves result from resolution of audits of prior year filings  the expiration of the statute of limitations  changes in tax laws and current year estimates for asserted and unasserted items 
inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law  both legislated and concluded through the various jurisdictions tax court systems 
significant changes in our estimates could materially affect our reported results 

table of contents under us gaap addressing the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  tax positions that previously failed to meet the more likely than not threshold should be recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met 
previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more likely than not threshold should be derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met 
we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions  and the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in various tax jurisdictions 
the application is subject to legal and factual interpretation  judgment and uncertainty 
tax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy  changes in legislation  the evolution of regulations and court rulings 
therefore  the actual liability for taxes may be materially different from our estimates  which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or to reverse previously recorded tax liabilities 
insurance reserves we use estimates in the determination of the appropriate liabilities for general liability  workers compensation and health insurance 
the estimated liability is established based upon historical claims data and third party actuarial estimates of settlement costs for incurred claims 
unanticipated changes in these factors may require us to revise our estimates 
we periodically reassess our assumptions and judgments and make adjustments when significant facts and circumstances dictate 
a change in any of the above estimates could impact our consolidated statements of earnings  and the related asset or liability recorded in our consolidated balance sheets would be adjusted accordingly 
historically  actual results have not been materially different than the estimates that are described above 
recently adopted accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu  improvements to financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities 
this asu  among other things  i changes existing guidance for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity vie  ii requires ongoing reassessments of whether an entity is the primary beneficiary of a vie  and iii requires enhanced disclosures about an entity involvement in a vie 
the company adopted these amendments effective january   and adoption had no impact on the company consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued asu no 
 improving disclosures about fair value measurement asu 
this asu added disclosure requirements about transfers related to assets and liabilities measured using level and inputs as defined  clarified existing fair value disclosure requirements about the appropriate level of disaggregation  and clarified that a description of valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value was required for recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements of assets and liabilities using level and inputs as defined 
the company adopted these provisions of the asu beginning with the consolidated financial statements for the period ended march  the adoption of these provisions of this asu only affected the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements and as a result had no impact on the company balance sheets  statements of operations or statements of cash flows 
in february  the fasb issued asu  subsequent events amendments to certain recognition and disclosure requirements 
this asu retracts the existing requirement to disclose the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated and whether that date is the date the financial statements were issued or were available to be issued 
the guidance was effective immediately upon issuance and adoption had no impact on the company financial statements 

table of contents new accounting pronouncements asu also requires that disclosures about purchase  sale  issuance  and settlement activity related to assets and liabilities whose fair value is measured using level inputs be presented on a gross basis rather than as a net number as currently permitted 
this provision of this asu will be effective for the company reporting period ending march  as this provision amends only the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements  the adoption will have no impact on the company balance sheets  statements of operations or statements of cash flows 
in july  the fasb issued asu  disclosures about the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses 
this asu amends disclosure requirements with respect to the credit quality of financing receivables and the related allowance for credit losses 
entities will be required to disaggregate by portfolio segment or class certain existing disclosures and provide certain new disclosures about its financing receivables and related allowance for credit losses 
disclosures to be made as of the end of a reporting period will be effective for the company reporting period ending december   the disclosures about activity that occurs during a reporting period will be effective for the company reporting period ending march  since this asu will only amended disclosure requirements  not current accounting practice  adoption of this asu with respect to end of reporting period disclosures did not have any impact on the company balance sheets  statements of operations or statements of cash flows 
the company reviewed all other significant newly issued accounting pronouncements and concluded that they either are not applicable to the company operations or that no material effect is expected on the company financial statements as a result of future adoption item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risk  including interest rates and commodity prices 
we address these risks through controlled risk management that may include the use of derivative financial instruments to economically hedge or reduce these exposures 
we do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk our interest income and expense is more sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of united states interest rates than to changes in rates in other markets 
changes in the united states treasury based interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash and investments  and interest expense on our senior secured credit facility 
our future investment income and interest expense may differ from expectations due to changes in interest rates 
investments in fixed interest rate earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates 
we currently do not hold any fixed rate investments 
as of december  our long term investments are comprised primarily of certificates of deposits  mutual funds invested in auction rate securities and one auction rate security  these investments are included in restricted assets related to the captive insurance subsidiary 
we have classified these investments as available for sale 
due to the short time period between reset dates of the interest rates  there are no unrealized gains or losses associated with interest rate related to the auction rate securities 
the one auction rate security has a contractual maturity of december based on our cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash and long term restricted investment holdings as of december   a increase in interest rates would increase our annual interest income by approximately million 
a decline in interest rates would decrease our annual interest income by less than million as the majority of our cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash and long term investment holdings are currently yielding less than 

table of contents at december   we had million of variable rate debt the term loan under our credit agreement 
if the interest rate on the term facility were to increase by per annum  annual interest expense would increase by approximately million based on the outstanding term facility balance at december  a decrease in interest rates from december  rates would have no impact on interest expense as the current interest is at the floor rate as defined in the credit agreement 
commodity prices many of the food products purchased by us and our franchisees and area licensees are affected by commodity pricing and are  therefore  subject to unpredictable price volatility 
extreme changes in commodity prices and or long term changes could affect our franchisees  area licensees and company operated restaurants adversely 
we expect that  in most cases  the ihop and applebee systems would be able to pass increased commodity prices through to our consumers via increases in menu prices 
from time to time  competitive circumstances could limit short term menu price flexibility  and in those cases  margins would be negatively impacted by increased commodity prices 
we believe that any changes in commodity pricing that cannot be adjusted for by changes in menu pricing or other strategies would not be material to our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in february  the company and owners of applebee and ihop franchise restaurants formed cscs to manage procurement activities for the applebee and ihop restaurants choosing to join the co op 
we believe the larger scale created by combining the supply chain requirements of both brands under one organization can provide cost savings and efficiency in the purchasing function 
as of december   of applebee franchise restaurants and over of ihop franchise restaurants are members of cscs 
while the majority of the food products utilized by ihop and applebee systems are sourced through cscs  in some instances  we enter into commitments to purchase food and other items on behalf of the ihop and applebee systems 
none of these food product contracts or agreements is a derivative instrument 
at december   our outstanding purchase commitments for food products were less than million
