overview we are an integrated biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative therapies that deliver the benefits of protein therapies to patients and clinicians in the fields of neurology and gastroenterology 
we are currently conducting a number of drug development programs for diseases such as pancreatitis  friedreich s ataxia and spinal muscular atrophy 
we also have a bioprocessing business that focuses on the development and commercialization of biologics that are used in the production of biopharmaceuticals 
in addition  we have out licensed certain biologics intellectual property from which we receive royalties from bristol myers squibb company bristol on their net sales in the united states of their product orencia 
total revenue in fiscal increased significantly as compared to fiscal and is primarily due to an increase in our bioprocessing product sales as we experienced increased orders from our largest customer as it rebounded from relatively low levels of activity in the prior period 
critical accounting policies and estimates while our significant accounting polices are more fully described in the notes to our financial statements  we have identified the policies and estimates below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact of and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
revenue recognition we generate product revenues from the sale of bioprocessing products to customers in the pharmaceutical and process chromatography industries 
we recognize revenue related to product sales upon delivery of the product to the customer as long as there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
determination of whether these criteria have been met are based on management s judgments primarily regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for product delivered  and the collectability of those fees 
we have a few longstanding customers who comprise the majority of revenue and have excellent payment history and therefore we do not require collateral 
we have had no significant write offs of uncollectible invoices in the periods presented 

table of contents at the time of sale  we also evaluate the need to accrue for warranty and sales returns 
the supply agreements we have with our customers and related purchase orders identify the terms and conditions of each sale and the price of the goods ordered 
due to the nature of the sales arrangements  inventory produced for sale is tested for quality specifications prior to shipment 
since the product is manufactured to order and in compliance with required specifications prior to shipment  the likelihood of sales return  warranty or other issues is largely diminished 
sales returns and warranty issues are infrequent and have had nominal impact on our financial statements historically 
in april  we settled our outstanding litigation with bristol and began recognizing royalty revenue in fiscal year for bristol s net sales in the united states of orencia which is used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis 
pursuant to the bristol settlement  we recognized   and  in royalty revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
the  royalty revenue in fiscal included a million initial payment and million for sales of orencia prior to fiscal  in addition to royalties earned on sales of orencia during our fiscal revenue earned from bristol royalties is recorded in the periods when it is earned based on royalty reports sent by bristol to us 
we have no continuing obligations to bristol as a result of this settlement 
additionally  during fiscal years and  we earned and recognized approximately  and  respectively in royalty revenue from chirhoclin for their sales of secretin 
revenue earned from chirhoclin royalties was recorded in the periods when it was earned based on royalty reports sent by chirhoclin to us 
as of december   chirhoclin had fulfilled its royalty obligations to us for its sales of secretin 
we do not expect to recognize any further royalty revenue from chirhoclin 
during fiscal  we recognized approximately  of revenue from sponsored research and development projects under agreements with the muscular dystrophy association  the national institutes of health scripps research institute  go friedreich s ataxia research gofar  and the friedreich s ataxia research alliance 
in fiscal  we also recognized approximately  in one time grants under the qualifying therapeutic discovery project program which was created in march as part of the patient protection and affordability care act 
in fiscal  we recognized approximately  of revenue from sponsored research and development projects under agreements with the muscular dystrophy association  the friedreich s ataxia research alliance and the national ataxia foundation 
during fiscal  we recognized approximately  of revenue from sponsored research and development projects under agreements with the muscular dystrophy association and gofar  respectively 
research revenue is recognized when the expense has been incurred and services have been performed 
determination of which incurred costs qualify for reimbursement under the terms of our contractual agreements and the timing of when such costs were incurred involves the judgment of management 
our calculations are based upon the agreed upon terms as stated in the arrangements 
however  should the estimated calculations change or be challenged by other parties to the agreements  research revenue may be adjusted in subsequent periods 
the calculations have not historically changed or been challenged  and we do not anticipate any significant subsequent change in revenue related to sponsored research and development projects 
there have been no material changes to our initial estimates related to revenue recognition in any periods presented in the accompanying financial statements 
inventories inventories relate to our bioprocessing business 
we value inventory at cost or  if lower  fair market value using the first in  first out method 
we review our inventory at least quarterly and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on our estimates of expected sales volume  production capacity and expiration dates of raw materials  work in process and finished products 
expected sales volumes are determined based on supply forecasts provided by key customers for the next three to twelve months 
we write down inventory that has 
table of contents become obsolete  inventory that has a cost basis in excess of its expected net realizable value  and inventory in excess of expected requirements to cost of product revenue 
manufacturing of bioprocessing finished goods is done to order and tested for quality specifications prior to shipment 
a change in the estimated timing or amount of demand for our products could result in additional provisions for excess inventory quantities on hand 
any significant unanticipated changes in demand or unexpected quality failures could have a significant impact on the value of inventory and reported operating results 
during all periods presented in the accompanying financial statements  there have been no material adjustments related to a revised estimate of inventory valuations 
business combinations amounts paid for acquisitions are allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  if any  based on their fair values at the dates of acquisition 
the fair value of identifiable intangible assets is based on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions determined by management 
any excess of purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is allocated to goodwill 
the fair value of contingent consideration includes estimates and judgments made by management regarding the extent of royalties to be earned in excess of the defined minimum royalties 
management updates these estimates and the related fair value of contingent consideration at each reporting period 
accrued liabilities we estimate accrued liabilities by identifying services performed on our behalf  estimating the level of service performed and determining the associated cost incurred for such service as of each balance sheet date 
examples of estimated accrued expenses include fees paid to contract manufacturers in conjunction with the production of clinical materials 
these expenses are normally determined through a contract or purchase order issued by us  service fees paid to organizations for their performance in conducting clinical trials 
these expenses are determined by contracts in place for those services and communications with project managers on costs which have been incurred as of each reporting date  professional and consulting fees incurred with law firms  audit and accounting service providers and other third party consultants 
these expenses are determined by either requesting those service providers to estimate unbilled services at each reporting date for services incurred or tracking costs incurred by service providers under fixed fee arrangements 
we have processes in place to estimate the appropriate amounts to record for accrued liabilities  which principally involve the applicable personnel reviewing the services provided 
in the event that we do not identify certain costs which have begun to be incurred or we under or over estimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services  the reported expenses for that period may be too low or too high 
the date on which certain services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date  and the cost of such services are often judgmental 
we make these judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known at the date of the financial statements 
a change in the estimated cost or volume of services provided could result in additional accrued liabilities 
any significant unanticipated changes in such estimates could have a significant impact on our accrued liabilities and reported operating results 
there have been no material adjustments to our accrued liabilities in any of the periods presented in the accompanying financial statements 
stock based compensation we use the black scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value of share based awards on the grant date 

table of contents the expected term of options granted represents the period of time for which the options are expected to be outstanding and is derived from our historical stock option exercise experience and option expiration data 
the expected life of stock options granted is based on the simplified method 
accordingly  the expected term is presumed to be the midpoint between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term 
in addition  for purposes of estimating the expected term  we have aggregated all individual option awards into one group as we do not expect substantial differences in exercise behavior among its employees 
the expected volatility is a measure of the amount by which our stock price is expected to fluctuate during the expected term of options granted 
we determined the expected volatility based upon the historical volatility of our common stock over a period commensurate with the option s expected term  exclusive of any events not reasonably anticipated to recur over the option s expected term 
the risk free interest rate is the implied yield available on us treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the option s expected term on the grant date 
we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on any of our capital stock and do not expect to do so in the foreseeable future 
accordingly  we use an expected dividend yield of zero to calculate the grant date fair value of a stock option 
we recognize compensation expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period based upon options that are ultimately expected to vest  and accordingly  such compensation expense has been adjusted by an amount of estimated forfeitures 
forfeitures represent only the unvested portion of a surrendered option 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
based on an analysis of historical data  we have calculated an annual forfeiture rate for non executive level employees  a annual forfeiture rate for executive level employees  and a forfeiture rate for non employee members of the board of directors  which we believe is a reasonable assumption to estimate forfeitures 
however  the estimation of forfeitures requires significant judgment  and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
for the years ended march   and  we recorded stock based compensation expense of approximately   and  respectively  for stock options granted under the second amended and restated repligen corporation stock plan the plan 
as of march   there was  of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share based awards 
this cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average remaining requisite service period of years 
we expect  in unvested options to vest over the next five years 
results of operations the following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements and the related footnotes thereto 
revenues total revenues for fiscal  and were   and  respectively  and were primarily comprised of sales of our bioprocessing products and royalties 
our total revenue was comprised of year ended march  change vs 
vs 
in thousands  except percentages bioprocessing secreflo product revenue royalty and other revenue total revenue 
table of contents substantially all of our bioprocessing products are based on recombinant protein a and are sold to customers who incorporate our manufactured products into their proprietary antibody purification systems to be sold directly to the pharmaceutical industry 
monoclonal antibodies are a well established class of drug with applications in rheumatoid arthritis  asthma and a variety of cancers 
sales of our bioprocessing products are therefore impacted by the timing of large scale production orders and the regulatory approvals for such antibodies  which may result in significant quarterly fluctuations 
during fiscal  bioprocessing product sales increased by  or as compared to fiscal volume increased due to increased demand from certain key customers and other business events  but was offset by a decrease in sales revenue due to changes in the mix of products sold in fiscal as compared to fiscal we sell bioprocessing products at various price points 
the mix of products sold varies and impacts the fluctuations in total product revenue and cost of product revenues from period to period 
during fiscal  bioprocessing product sales decreased by  or as compared to fiscal volume decreased due to decreased demand from certain key customers in reaction to current economic conditions and other business events 
changes in the mix of products sold in fiscal as compared to fiscal comprised the remaining decrease 
we anticipate that bioprocessing product sales will increase moderately in fiscal in addition  our bioprocessing product sales may be subject to quarterly fluctuations due to the timing of large scale production orders 
pursuant to the bristol settlement  we recognized royalty revenue of approximately   and  in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the  recognized in fiscal included an initial million royalty payment  million in royalties for sales of orencia from january  to march   as well as million for sales in fiscal year for fiscal  we expect royalty revenues to increase moderately over fiscal as bristol s orencia continues to penetrate the market 
also  during fiscal years and  we earned and recognized approximately  and  respectively  in royalty revenue from chirhoclin 
as of december   chirhoclin had fulfilled its royalty obligations to us for its sales of our secretin 
we do not expect to recognize any further royalty revenue from chirhoclin 
during fiscal  we recognized approximately  of revenue from sponsored research and development projects under agreements with the muscular dystrophy association  the national institutes of health scripps research institute  go friedreich s ataxia research gofar  and the friedreich s ataxia research alliance 
in fiscal  we also recognized approximately  in one time grants under the qualifying therapeutic discovery project program which was created in march as part of the patient protection and affordability care act 
in fiscal  we recognized approximately  of revenue from sponsored research and development projects under agreements with the muscular dystrophy association  the friedreich s ataxia research alliance and the national ataxia foundation 
during fiscal  we recognized approximately  of revenue from sponsored research and development projects under agreements with the muscular dystrophy association and gofar  respectively 
we expect research and license revenues will remain relatively consistent in fiscal as the mda grant related effort continues 

table of contents costs and operating expenses total costs and operating expenses for fiscal  and consist of the following year ended march  change vs 
vs 
in thousands costs and operating expenses cost of product revenue cost of royalty and other revenue research and development selling  general and administrative total costs and operating expenses the increase in cost of product revenue of  or in fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily due to a increase in bioprocessing product sales and is partially offset by favorable manufacturing variances 
the decrease in cost of product revenue of  or in fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily due to a decrease in bioprocessing product sales as well as favorable manufacturing variances 
this decrease is partially offset by higher depreciation costs of approximately  related to investments in our manufacturing facilities 
pursuant to the bristol settlement  we must remit of royalty revenue received through the expiration of the agreement in december to the university of michigan 
for fiscal  and  this cost of royalty revenue was approximately   and  respectively 
this increase is directly related to the increase in bristol royalty revenue noted above 
research and development costs primarily include costs of internal personnel  external pharmacology and toxicology research  clinical trials and the costs associated with the manufacturing and testing of clinical materials 
we are currently pursuing regulatory approval of an nda for rg for mri imaging of the pancreas and are developing an expansion of our opus product line 
in addition  we are preparing to initiate phase studies for rg for friedreich s ataxia and rg for spinal muscular atrophy  pending regulatory approvals 
due to the small size of the company and the fact that these various programs share personnel and fixed costs  we do not track all of our expenses or allocate any fixed costs by program  and therefore  have not provided an estimate of historical costs incurred by project 
each of our therapeutic research and development programs is subject to risks and uncertainties  including the requirement to seek regulatory approvals that are outside of our control 
for example  our clinical trials may be subject to delays based on our inability to enroll patients at the rate that we expect to meet the schedule for our planned clinical trials 
moreover  the product candidates identified in these research programs  particularly in our early stage programs must overcome significant technological  manufacturing and marketing challenges before they can be successfully commercialized 
for example  results from our preclinical animal models may not be replicated in our clinical trials with humans 
as a result of these risks and uncertainties  we are unable to predict with any certainty the period in which material net cash inflows from such projects could be expected to commence or the completion date of these programs 
these risks and uncertainties prevent us from estimating with any certainty the specific timing and future costs of our research and development programs  although historical trends within the industry suggest that expenses tend to increase in later stages of development 
arrangements with commercial vendors and academic researchers accounted for   and of our research and development expenses for fiscal   and  respectively 
the outsourcing of such services provides us flexibility to discontinue or increase spending depending on the success of our research and development programs 

table of contents during fiscal  research and development expenses decreased by  or as compared to fiscal this decrease is comprised primarily of  related to our secretin program for mri imaging of the pancreas as the re analysis of the images obtained from our phase clinical trial was completed in fiscal and the clinical trial was ongoing in fiscal   related to our uridine program to treat bipolar depression as the phase b trial was completed in march and  related to our friedreich s ataxia program 
these decreases were partially offset by a  increase related to our dcps program to develop a drug for the treatment of patients with spinal muscular atrophy 
during fiscal  research and development expenses increased by  or as compared to fiscal this increase is comprised primarily of  related to our dcps program to develop a drug for the treatment of patients with spinal muscular atrophy   related to friedreich s ataxia as we identified a clinical candidate and began preparing for a phase clinical trial and  related to increased personnel expenses primarily due to headcount additions in clinical and regulatory areas 
these increases were partially offset by a  decrease as we approached the end of our phase clinical trial for rg  evaluating the use of human secretin in aiding pancreatic imaging 
future research and development expenses are dependent on a number of variables  including the cost and design of clinical trials and external costs such as manufacturing of clinical materials 
we expect our research and development expenses in fiscal to increase primarily due to drug manufacturing  regulatory and filing fees associated with the regulatory approval of rg for mri imaging of the pancreas and to continued development and expansion of our opus product line 
also in fiscal  we plan to initiate phase studies for rg for friedreich s ataxia and rg for spinal muscular atrophy  pending regulatory approvals 
there may be further increases in expenses if we acquire additional product candidates 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses include the associated costs with selling our commercial products and costs required to support our research and development efforts including legal  accounting  patent  shareholder services  amortization of intangible assets and other administrative functions 
in addition  sg a expenses have historically included costs associated with various litigation matters 
in fiscal  sg a costs increased by  or as compared to fiscal this increase is primarily due to increased personnel expenses of approximately  due to headcount increases in marketing and business development including salaries  stock based compensation and recruiting costs  increased investor relations expenses of  increased patent prosecution costs of  and increased amortization expense of  related to the bioflash acquisition 
in fiscal  sg a costs increased by  or as compared to fiscal this increase is primarily due to increased personnel expenses of  primarily due to headcount increases in marketing and business development including salaries and stock based compensation 
we expect sg a expenses to increase in fiscal primarily due to commercialization efforts as we prepare to launch rg for mri imaging of the pancreas  pending fda approval  and slightly higher headcount and related personnel expenses 
investment income investment income includes income earned on invested cash balances 
investment income for fiscal  and was approximately   and  respectively 
the decrease of  or in fiscal compared to fiscal and the decrease of  or in fiscal compared to fiscal are primarily attributable to lower interest rates 
we expect interest income to vary based on changes in the amount of funds invested and fluctuation of interest rates 

table of contents benefit from income taxes in fiscal year  we recorded a tax benefit of approximately  primarily due to the worker  homeownership  and business assistance act of the act that was enacted in november among other things  the act suspended the limitation on the use of net operating losses to offset alternative minimum tax liabilities  which enabled us to recover  of alternative minimum taxes paid in prior years 
as a result  the company had an effective tax rate of negative 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations primarily through sales of equity securities  revenues derived from product sales  and research grants  as well as proceeds and royalties from litigation settlements 
our revenue for the foreseeable future will be limited to our bioprocessing product revenue  royalties from bristol  and research and development grants 
given the uncertainties related to pharmaceutical product development  we are currently unable to reliably estimate when  if ever  our therapeutic product candidates will generate revenue and cash flows 
at march   we had cash and marketable securities of  compared to  at march  a deposit for leased office space of  is classified as restricted cash and is not included in cash and marketable securities total for either or cash flows in thousands year ended march  cash provided by used in increase decrease increase decrease operating activities investing activities financing activities operating activities in fiscal  our operating activities provided cash of  reflecting a net loss of approximately  which includes non cash charges totaling approximately  including depreciation  amortization  and stock based compensation charges

in fiscal  our investing activities generated  of cash  which was primarily due to net maturities of marketable debt securities of  partially offset by  of cash used to acquire the assets of bioflash and  for capital expenditures 
in fiscal  our investing activities consumed  of cash  which was primarily due to net purchases of marketable debt securities of  also in fiscal  we spent  on capital expenditures as we continued to upgrade both our research and development and manufacturing capabilities 
we place our marketable security investments in high quality credit instruments as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
financing activities exercises of stock options provided cash receipts of   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
fiscal financing activities also included the repurchase of common stock which consumed  off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any special purpose entities or off balance sheet financing arrangements 
contractual obligations as of march   we had the following fixed obligations and commitments payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations purchase obligations contractual obligations total represents purchase orders for the procurement of raw material for manufacturing as well as clinical materials to support our upcoming trials 
these amounts include obligations for minimum contingent consideration from acquisitions as well as for license  supply and consulting agreements 
capital requirements our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the following the success of our clinical studies  the scope of and progress made in our research and development activities  our ability to acquire additional products or product candidates  our ability to establish one or more partnerships for commercialization of rg outside the us  the extent of any share repurchase activity  the success of any proposed financing efforts  the ability to sustain sales and profits of our bioprocessing products  and the amount of royalty revenues we receive from bristol 
absent acquisitions of additional products  product candidates or intellectual property  we believe our current cash balances are adequate to meet our cash needs for at least the next twenty four months 
we expect to incur increased expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal this is primarily due to commercialization 
table of contents efforts as we prepare to launch rg for mri imaging of the pancreas  pending regulatory approval  the development and expansion of our opus product line  and the initiation of phase studies for rg for friedreich s ataxia and rg for spinal muscular atrophy  pending regulatory approvals 
our future capital requirements include  but are not limited to  continued investment in our research and development programs  the acquisition of additional products and technologies to complement our manufacturing capabilities  capital expenditures primarily associated with purchases of equipment and continued investment in our intellectual property portfolio 
we plan to continue to invest in our bioprocessing business and in key research and development activities 
we actively evaluate various strategic transactions on an ongoing basis  including licensing or acquiring complementary products  technologies or businesses that would complement our existing portfolio of development programs 
we continue to seek to acquire such potential assets that may offer us the best opportunity to create value for our shareholders 
in order to acquire such assets  we may need to seek additional financing to fund these investments 
this may require the issuance or sale of additional equity or debt securities 
the sale of additional equity may result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
should we need to secure additional financing to acquire a product  fund future investment in research and development  or meet our future liquidity requirements  we may not be able to secure such financing  or obtain such financing on favorable terms because of the volatile nature of the biotechnology marketplace 
net operating loss carryforwards at march   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  and business tax credits carryforwards of approximately  available to reduce future federal income taxes  if any 
additionally  at march   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  and business tax credits carryforwards of approximately  available to reduce future state income taxes  if any 
the net operating loss and business tax credits carryforwards will continue to expire at various dates through march net operating loss carryforwards and available tax credits are subject to review and possible adjustment by the internal revenue service and may be limited in the event of certain changes in the ownership interest of significant stockholders 
in fiscal year  we recorded a tax benefit of approximately  primarily due to the worker  homeownership  and business assistance act of the act that was enacted in november among other things  the act suspended the limitation on the use of net operating losses to offset alternative minimum tax liabilities and enabled us to receive a refund of  for alternative minimum taxes paid in prior years 
in fiscal  we utilized our net operating loss carryforwards to reduce our income tax provision 
effects of inflation our assets are primarily monetary  consisting of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
because of their liquidity  these assets are not directly affected by inflation 
since we intend to retain and continue to use our equipment  furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements  we believe that the incremental inflation related to replacement costs of such items will not materially affect our operations 
however  the rate of inflation affects our expenses  such as those for employee compensation and contract services  which could increase our level of expenses and the rate at which we use our resources

asu is effective on a prospective basis for milestones achieved in fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning on or after june  we adopted asu in july the adoption of this update did not have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows as our accounting policy was consistent with the provisions of asu 
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we have investments in us government and agency securities  corporate bonds and other debt securities 
as a result  we are exposed to potential loss from market risks that may occur as a result of changes in interest rates  changes in credit quality of the issuer or otherwise 
we generally place our marketable security investments in high quality credit instruments  as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
a hypothetical basis point decrease in interest rates would result in an approximate  decrease in the fair value of our investments as of march  we believe  however  that the conservative nature of our investments mitigates our interest rate exposure  and our investment policy limits the amount of our credit exposure to any one issue  issuer with the exception of us agency obligations and type of instrument 
we do not expect any material loss from our marketable security investments and therefore believe that our potential interest rate exposure is limited 
we intend to hold the majority of our investments to maturity  in accordance with our business plans
