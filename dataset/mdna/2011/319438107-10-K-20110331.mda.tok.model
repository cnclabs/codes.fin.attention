item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion provides information about the results of operations and financial condition  liquidity and capital resources 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements 
overview the company is a bank holding company which owns of the stock of first capital bank the bank 
we are headquartered in glen allen  virginia and conduct our primary operations through our wholly owned subsidiary 
through its seven full service branch offices and courier service  the bank serves the greater richmond metropolitan area which includes the counties of henrico  chesterfield and hanover  the town of ashland and the city of richmond  virginia 
we target small to medium sized businesses and consumers in our market area and emerging suburbs outside of the greater richmond metropolitan area 
in addition  we strive to develop personal  knowledgeable relationships with our customers  while at the same time offering products comparable to statewide regional banks located in its market area 
we believe that the marketing of customized banking services has enabled it to establish a niche in the financial services marketplace in the richmond metropolitan area 
the difficult economic environment during and negatively impacted our financial performance as we realized a net loss of million for the year ended december  compared to thousand profit for the year ended december  net loss available to common shareholders  which deducts from net income the dividends and discount accretion on preferred stock  was a loss of million for the year ended december  compared to a loss of thousand a year ago 
the key factor affecting the full year results was an million provision to loans losses due to an unstable economic environment resulting in increased charge offs and nonperforming assets during the year 
return on average common equity for the year ended december  was  while return on average assets was  compared to and  respectively  for the year ended for the year ended december   assets grew million to million or from million at december  total net loans at december  were million  a decrease of million  or  from the december  amount of million 
deposits increased million to million  or from the december  amount of million 
we remain well capitalized with capital ratios above the regulatory minimums 
critical accounting policies the financial condition and results of operations presented in the consolidated financial statements  the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements and this section are  to a large degree  dependent upon our accounting policies 
the selection and applications of these accounting policies involve judgments  estimates  and uncertainties that are susceptible to change 
first capital bank s critical accounting policy relates to the evaluation of the allowance for loan losses which is based on management s opinion of an amount that is adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the bank s existing portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses that may be sustained in the loan portfolio 
the allowance is based on two basic principles of accounting i asc contingencies  which requires that losses be accrued when occurrence is probable and can be reasonably estimated  and ii asc receivables  which requires that losses be accrued based on the differences 
table of contents between the value of collateral  present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market and the loan balance 
the company s allowance for loan losses is the accumulation of various components that are calculated based on independent methodologies 
all components of the allowance represent an estimation performed pursuant to applicable gaap 
management s estimate of each homogenous pool component is based on certain observable data that management believes are most reflective of the underlying credit losses being estimated 
this evaluation includes credit quality trends  collateral values  loan volumes  geographic  borrower and industry concentrations  seasoning of the loan portfolio  the findings of internal credit quality assessments and results from external bank regulatory examinations 
these factors  as well as historical losses and current economic and business conditions  are used in developing estimated loss factors used in the calculations 
applicable gaap requires that the impairment of loans that have been separately identified for evaluation are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows or  alternatively  the observable market price of the loans or the fair value of the collateral 
however  for those loans that are collateral dependent that is  if repayment of those loans is expected to be provided solely by the underlying collateral and for which management has determined foreclosure is probable  the measure of impairment is to be based on the net realizable value of the collateral 
this statement also requires certain disclosures about investments in impaired loans and the allowance for loan losses and interest income recognized on impaired loans 
reserves for commercial loans are determined by applying estimated loss factors to the portfolio based on historical loss experience and management s evaluation and risk grading of the commercial loan portfolio 
reserves are provided for noncommercial loan categories using historical loss factors applied to the total outstanding loan balance of each loan category 
additionally  environmental factors based on national and local economic conditions  as well as portfolio specific attributes  are considered in estimating the allowance for loan losses 
while management uses the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if future economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the valuations or  if required by regulators  based upon information available to them at the time of their examinations 
such adjustments to original estimates  as necessary  are made in the period in which these factors and other relevant considerations indicate that loss levels may vary from previous estimates 
results of operations net interest income we generate a significant amount of our income from the net interest income earned by the bank 
net interest income is the difference between interest income and interest expense 
interest income depends on the amount of interest earning assets outstanding during the period and the interest rates earned thereon 
interest expense is a function of the average amount of deposits and borrowed money outstanding during the period and the interest rates paid thereon 
the quality of the assets further influences the amount of interest income lost on non accrual loans and the amount of additions to the allowance for loan losses 
net interest income represents our principal source of earnings 
net interest income is the amount by which interest generated from earning assets exceeds the expense of funding those assets 
changes in 
table of contents volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  as well as their respective yields and rates  have a significant impact on the level of net interest income 
the following table reflects an analysis of our net interest income using the daily average balance of our assets and liabilities as of the periods indicated

table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  the decline in the general level of interest rates over the last three years has placed downward pressure on the company s yield on earning assets and related interest income 
the decline in earning asset yields  however  has been offset principally by repricing of money market accounts and certificates of deposit 
the company also expects net interest margin to be relatively stable over the next several quarters 
net interest income for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december  net interest income increased due to a basis point increase in the net interest margin from for the year ended december  to for the comparable period of average earning assets increased million  or  to million for from million for while net loans outstanding decreased million  average loans  net of unearned income increased million  or for to million 
the average rate earned on net loans  decreased basis points to from for the year ended december  the average balance in our securities portfolio increased million in to million from million in we used liquidity generated by deposits and tarp funds to mitigate interest rate risk and pick up spreads over the federal funds rate

the provision for loan losses for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  changes in the amount of provision for loan losses during each period reflect the results of the bank s analysis used to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
we are committed to making loan loss provisions that maintain an allowance that adequately reflects the risk inherent in our loan portfolio 
this commitment is more fully discussed in the asset quality section below 
non interest income year ended december  compared to year ended december  non interest income has been and will continue to be an important factor for increasing profitability 
management continues to consider areas where non interest income can be increased 
non interest income increased thousand to million for the year ended december  compared to thousand for the same period in the primary cause of the increase in non interest income was the sale of securities resulting in a gain of thousand as compared to no gain in fees on deposits increased thousand to thousand for the year compared to for the year 

table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  non interest income increased thousand to thousand for the year ended december  compared to thousand for the same period in fees on deposits increased thousand to thousand for the year compared to for the year 
other non interest income decreased thousand for the year compared to components of the decrease are document prep fees of thousand as a result of decreased loan volume and decrease in gains and fees on sale of mortgages of thousand due to decreases in mortgage loans originated 
these reductions were offset by a thousand increase in investment services offered to our customers and thousand increase in fees on letters of credit 
non interest expense year ended december  compared to year ended december  total noninterest expense increased or million to million for as compared to million for the year noninterest expense was of average assets for the year ended december  salaries and employee benefits increased to million for the year as compared to million for salaries and benefits increased due to key additions to the lending and management team and infrastructure during and the first quarter of occupancy costs decreased thousand as the result of purchasing the corporate headquarters in  thus eliminating rent expense for most of this was offset by increases in depreciation of the building acquired as depreciation expense increased to thousand for the year ended december  as compared to thousand for professional fees increased thousand for the year to thousand from thousand in this was primarily the result of increasing legal fees associated with a higher volume of customer work out agreements  foreclosures and settlements in advertising and marketing costs increased thousand to thousand in from thousand in  as additional marketing and name branding were used in virginia capital stock tax decreased thousand  or  to thousand during from thousand for the decrease was due to loss in equity of the bank during the year

merger costs totaled thousand for the year ended december  these costs were legal  accounting and investment advisors cost associated with a transaction that was subsequently terminated 
occupancy costs decreased thousand as the result of relocating the rented innsbrook office to an owned location in westmark  saving thousand in rent 
this was offset by a thousand increase in renting the james center office and the bon air office for all of as compared to a partial year in professional fees increased to thousand for the year from thousand in this was primarily the result of increasing legal fees associated with a higher volume of customer work out agreements  foreclosures and settlements in advertising and marketing costs decreased thousand or to thousand in from thousand in the branding campaign started in was suspended due to poor economic conditions

while economic indicators suggest the recession has technically ended and there are some signs of increased economic activity  the signals are somewhat mixed and there could be additional deterioration in asset quality in the near term 
the magnitude of any such softening is largely dependent upon any lagging impact on commercial real estate  the recovery of residential housing  and the pace at which the economies in the markets we serve recover 
the company does not originate or purchase loans from foreign entities or loans classified by regulators as highly leveraged transactions 
the company s loan portfolio does not include exposure to option adjustable rate mortgage products  high loan to value ratio mortgages  interest only mortgage loans  subprime mortgage loans or mortgage loans with initial teaser rates 
the company does have junior lien mortgages second mortgages  primarily home equity loans 
the company s second mortgage portfolio is originated within the company s footprint and represented approximately of the total loan portfolio at december  the company has low loss experience within this portfolio and is prompted to perform updated valuations upon identification of a borrower weakness 
the sources of valuations are appraisals  broker price opinions  and automated valuation models 
while the level of nonperforming assets increased at the end of  the levels are considered manageable by the company 
resources continue to be devoted specifically to the ongoing review of the loan portfolio and the workouts of problem assets to minimize any losses to the company 
the company has in place a special assets loan committee  which includes the company s chief lending officer  chief credit officer  and other senior lenders and credit officers 
this committee formulates strategies  develops action plans  and approves all credit actions taken on significant problem loans 
management continues to monitor delinquencies  risk rating changes  charge offs  market trends and other indicators of risk in the company s portfolio  particularly those tied to residential and commercial real estate  and adjusts the allowance for loan losses accordingly 
historically  and particularly in the current economic environment  the company seeks to work with its customers on loan collection matters while taking appropriate actions to improve the company s position and minimize any losses 
these loans are closely managed and evaluated for collection with appropriate loss reserves established whenever necessary

non performing assets we place loans on a non accrual when the collection of principal and interest is doubtful  generally when a loan becomes days past due 
there are three negative implications for earnings when we place a loan on non accrual status 
first  all interest accrued but unpaid at the date that the loan is placed on non accrual status is either deducted from interest income or written off as a loss 
second  accruals on interest are discontinued until it becomes certain that both principal and interest can be repaid 
finally  there may be actual losses that require additional provisions for loan losses to be charged against earnings

these lines of credit  which bear interest at prevailing market rates  permit us to borrow funds in the overnight market  and are renewable annually 
interest rate sensitivity the most important element of asset liability management is the monitoring of the company s sensitivity to interest rate movements 
the income stream of the company is subject to risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations to the extent there is a difference between the amount of the company s interest earning assets and the amount of interest bearing liabilities that are prepaid  mature or repriced in specific periods 
our goal is to maximize net interest income within acceptable levels of risk to changes in interest rates 
we seek to meet this goal by influencing the maturity and re pricing characteristics of the various lending and deposit taking lines of business and by managing discretionary balance sheet asset and liability portfolios 
we monitor interest rate levels on a daily basis at meetings of the asset liability sub committee 
the following reports and or tools are used to assess the current interest rate environment and its impact on our earnings and liquidity monthly and year to date net interest margin and spread calculations  monthly and year to date balance sheet and income statements versus budget  quarterly net portfolio value analysis  a weekly survey of rates offered by other local competitive institutions and gap analysis matching maturities or repricing dates of interest sensitive assets to those of interest sensitive liabilities by periods and a risk manager model used to measure earnings at risk and economic value of equity at risk 
the data in the following table reflects repricing or expected maturities of various assets and liabilities 
the gap analysis represents the difference between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in a specific time interval 
interest sensitivity gap analysis presents a position that existed at one particular point in time  and assumes that assets and liabilities with similar repricing characteristics will reprice at the same time and to the same degree
