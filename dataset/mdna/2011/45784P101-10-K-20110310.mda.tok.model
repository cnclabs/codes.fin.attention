item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k  particularly under the heading risk factors 
overview we are a medical device company that develops  manufactures and markets an insulin infusion system for people with insulin dependent diabetes 
our proprietary omnipod insulin management system consists of our omnipod disposable insulin infusion device and our handheld  wireless personal diabetes manager 
the us food and drug administration  or fda  approved the omnipod system in january in october  we shipped our first commercial omnipod system 
we have progressively expanded our marketing efforts from an initial focus in the eastern united states to having availability of the omnipod system in the entire united states 
in january  we entered into a five year exclusive distribution agreement with ypsomed distribution ag  or ypsomed  which intends to distribute and sell our omnipod system in eleven countries  subject to approved reimbursement 
through our partnership with ypsomed  the omnipod system is now or will soon be available in seven markets including germany  the united kingdom  france  the netherlands  sweden  norway and switzerland 
we expect that ypsomed will begin distribution of the omnipod system  subject to approved reimbursement  in the other markets under the agreement in and in february  we entered into a distribution agreement with glaxosmithkline inc to become the exclusive distributor of the omnipod system in canada 
we focus our sales towards key diabetes practitioners  academic centers and clinics specializing in the treatment of diabetes patients  as well as individual diabetes patients 
our total revenue was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we currently produce the omnipod on a partially automated manufacturing line at a facility in china operated by a subsidiary of flextronics international ltd 
we purchase complete omnipods pursuant to our agreement with flextronics 
under the agreement  flextronics has agreed to supply us  as a non exclusive supplier  with omnipods at agreed upon prices per unit pursuant to a rolling month forecast that we provide 
the agreement may be terminated at any time by either party upon prior written notice given no less 
table of contents than a specified number of days prior to the date of termination 
the specified number of days is intended to provide the parties with sufficient time to make alternative arrangements in the event of termination 
by purchasing omnipods manufactured by flextronics in china  we have been able to substantially increase production volumes for the omnipod and reduce our per unit production cost 
to achieve profitability  we continue to seek to increase manufacturing volume and reduce the per unit production cost for the omnipod 
by increasing production volumes of the omnipod  we have been able to reduce our per unit raw material costs and improve absorption of manufacturing overhead costs 
this  as well as the introduction of our next generation omnipod  are important as we strive to achieve profitability 
we believe our manufacturing capacity at the end of is sufficient to meet our expected demand for omnipods 
our sales and marketing effort is focused on generating demand and acceptance of the omnipod system among healthcare professionals  people with insulin dependent diabetes  third party payors and third party distributors 
our marketing strategy is to build awareness for the benefits of the omnipod system through a wide range of education programs  social networking  patient demonstration programs  support materials  media advertisements and events at the national  regional and local levels 
we are using third party distributors to improve our access to managed care and government reimbursement programs  expand our commercial presence and provide access to additional potential patients 
as a medical device company  reimbursement from third party payors is an important element of our success 
if patients are not adequately reimbursed for the costs of using the omnipod system  it will be much more difficult for us to penetrate the market 
we continue to negotiate contracts establishing reimbursement for the omnipod system with national and regional third party payors 
as we expand our sales and marketing focus  increase our manufacturing capacity and expand to international markets  we will need to maintain and expand available reimbursement for the omnipod system 
since our inception in  we have incurred losses every quarter 
in the years ended december   and  we incurred net losses of million  million and million  respectively 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we have financed our operations through the private placement of debt and equity securities  public offerings of our common stock  a private placement of our convertible debt and borrowings under certain debt agreements 
as of december   we had million of convertible debt outstanding 
in december  we fully repaid million of outstanding debt relating to the facility agreement entered into in march and amended in september and june since inception  we have received net proceeds of million from the issuance of redeemable convertible preferred stock  common stock and debt 
our long term financial objective is to achieve and sustain profitable growth 
our efforts for will be focused primarily on the development  production and regulatory approval of our next generation omnipod system  the continued reduction in our per unit production costs on our existing product and the expansion of sales through international markets 
achieving these objectives is expected to require additional investments in certain personnel and initiatives to allow for us to increase our market penetration in the united states and international markets 
we believe that we will continue to incur net losses in the near term in order to achieve these objectives 
however  we believe that the accomplishment of our near term objectives will have a positive impact on our financial condition in the future 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  together with the cash to be generated from expected product sales  will be sufficient to meet our projected operating and debt service requirements through at least the end of financial operations overview revenue 
we derive nearly all of our revenue from the sale of the omnipod system directly to patients and third party distributors who resell the product to diabetes patients 
the omnipod system is comprised of two devices the omnipod  a disposable insulin infusion device that the patient wears for up to three days and then replaces  and the personal diabetes manager  or pdm  a handheld device much like a personal digital assistant that wirelessly programs the omnipod with insulin delivery instructions  assists the patient with diabetes management and incorporates a blood glucose meter 
revenue is derived from the sale to new 
table of contents customers or third party distributors of omnipods and starter kits  which include the pdm  the omnipod system user guide and our interactive training cd  and from the subsequent sales of omnipods to existing customers 
customers generally order a three month supply of omnipods 
in january  we entered into a five year exclusive distribution agreement with ypsomed which intends to distribute and sell the omnipod system  subject to approved reimbursement  in eleven countries 
through our partnership with ypsomed  the omnipod system is now or will soon be available in seven markets including germany  the united kingdom  france  the netherlands  sweden  norway and switzerland 
we expect that ypsomed will begin distributing the omnipod system  subject to approved reimbursement  in the other markets under the agreement in and in addition  in february  we entered into a distribution agreement with glaxosmithkline inc to become the exclusive distributor of the omnipod system in canada 
in march  we received a cash payment from abbott diabetes care  inc abbott for an agreement fee in connection with execution of the first amendment to the development and license agreement with abbott 
we are recognizing the payment as revenue over the year term of the agreement 
under the amended abbott agreement  beginning july   abbott agreed to pay us certain amounts for services performed in connection with each sale of a pdm that includes an abbott discrete blood glucose monitor to certain customers in the united states and israel 
in july  we entered into a second amendment to the development and license agreement with abbott 
under the terms of the second amendment  the license was extended to cover canada and certain other countries and abbott agreed to pay certain amounts over time to us for services we performed in connection with each sale of a pdm that includes an abbott discrete blood glucose monitor to customers in these 
we recognize the revenue related to this portion of the abbott agreement at the time we meet the criteria for revenue recognition  typically at the time of the sale of the pdm to a new patient 
in the years ended december  and  we recognized million and million of revenue  respectively  related to the amended abbott agreement 
the decrease from is attributable to amounts received from abbott related to upgrades for existing patients 
as of december  and  we had deferred revenue of million and million  respectively  which includes product related revenue as well as the unrecognized portion of the agreement fee related to the abbott agreement 
for the year ending december   we expect our revenue to continue to increase as we gain new customers in the united states and continue expansion in europe and certain other international markets 
increased revenue will be dependent upon the success of our sales efforts  our ability to produce omnipods in sufficient volumes and other risks and uncertainties 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue consists primarily of raw material  labor  warranty and overhead costs related to the omnipod system 
cost of revenue also includes depreciation  freight and packaging costs 
the increase in our omnipod production volume  including the production of our next generation omnipod  together with our ability to gain cost savings on our bill of materials  is expected to reduce the per unit cost of manufacturing the omnipods by allowing us to reduce our direct costs and spread our fixed and semi fixed overhead costs over a greater number of units 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs within our product development  regulatory and clinical functions  and the costs of market studies and product development projects 
we expense all research and development costs as incurred 
for the fiscal year  we expect overall research and development spending to decrease slightly from levels as we support our current research and development efforts  which are focused primarily on our next generation omnipod  as well the integration of our omnipod system with continuous glucose monitoring technology 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel serving the executive  finance  information technology and human resource functions  as well as legal fees  accounting fees  insurance costs  bad debt expenses  shipping  handling and facilities related costs 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase slightly in compared to as we continue to drive efficiencies in our administrative functions as we expand our business 

table of contents sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs within our sales  marketing  reimbursement support  customer support and training functions  sales commissions paid to our sales representatives and costs associated with participation in medical conferences  physician symposia and promotional activities  including distribution of units used in our demonstration kit programs 
in the year ending december   we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase slightly compared to to support the growth of our business 
restructuring and impairments of assets 
in connection with our efforts to pursue improved gross margins  leverage operational efficiencies and better pursue opportunities for low cost supplier sourcing of asset costs  we periodically perform an evaluation of our manufacturing processes and review the carrying value of our property and equipment to assess the recoverability of these assets and determine whether impairment may have occurred 
as part of this assessment  we review the planned use of the assets as well as the future undiscounted operating cash flows expected to be generated by those assets 
if impairment is indicated through this review  the carrying amount of the asset would be reduced to its estimated fair value 
this review of manufacturing processes and equipment can result in an impairment of assets based on current net book value and potential future use of the assets 
restructuring and impairment of assets is typically based on a review of our manufacturing processes and equipment and may include the difference between the net book value of an asset and the asset s fair value based on our expectation of its potential future use 
in addition  restructuring expense may also include workforce reduction and related costs for one time termination benefits provided to employees who are involuntarily terminated under the terms of a one time benefit arrangement 
based on estimates of related costs such as taxes and outplacement services which may be provided under the plan 
if changes in these estimated services occur  we may be required to record or reverse restructuring expenses associated with these workforce reduction and related costs

table of contents comparison of the years ended december  and december  revenue our total revenue was million for year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in revenue is due to the increase in the number of diabetes patients using the omnipod system including patients being serviced by third party domestic and international distributors 
cost of revenue cost of revenue was million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase is due to increased sales volume partially offset by lower per unit costs 
lower per unit cost is a result of cost savings on raw materials  volume discounts from our suppliers and increased production volumes 
revenue increased by from the year ended december  to the year ended december   while cost of revenue increased by only in the same period mainly due to the efficiencies realized in omnipod per unit cost 
research and development research and development expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december   which was primarily related to an increase of million of pods and other products used for research and development purposes and million of outside services in connection with development of the next generation omnipod  offset by a million decrease in employee related expenses 
general and administrative general and administrative expense decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december   which was primarily due to a reduction in bad debt expense of million

during the year  we determined that certain amounts related to manufacturing equipment for our next generation omnipod would not be used in our final product and recorded an impairment charge of approximately million 
in addition  we terminated certain other projects related to our existing omnipod as we focused primarily on the introduction of our next generation product 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million related to this manufacturing equipment and construction in process 
we had no new restructuring or impairment activity in the year ended december  
table of contents other expense  net interest income was million for the years ended december  and interest income was earned from cash deposits and short term interest bearing instruments 
interest expense increased million to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in interest expense is primarily due to amortization of the debt discount related to our notes and additional interest associated with the facility agreement entered into in march  amended in september and june and repaid in december we recorded interest expense on the notes of million in the year ended december  of the million  million related to the amortization of the debt discount  million related to the amortization of deferred financing costs  and million related to interest payments

restructuring and impairment of assets we had no restructuring or impairment activity in the year ended december  for the year ended december   our restructuring expenses and impairment of assets was million 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded restructuring charges of million for the impairment of certain manufacturing equipment no longer in use as well as workforce reduction and related costs 
as part of our strategic goal to pursue improved gross margins  leverage operational efficiencies and better pursue opportunities for low cost supplier sourcing  we transitioned the manufacturing of completed omnipods to flextronics international ltd  located in china 
we determined that we would no longer use certain manufacturing equipment located in our bedford facility 
in addition  this transition resulted in a reduction in workforce of approximately employees  mainly in the manufacturing and quality departments 
as a result of these actions  we recorded a non cash charge of million related to impairments of assets as well as million in workforce and related charges in other expense  net interest income was million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  this represents a decrease of million compared to the year ended december   caused primarily by lower cash balances and interest rates

shareholder rights plan in november  our board of directors adopted a shareholder rights plan  as set forth in the shareholder rights agreement between us and the rights agent  the purpose of which is  among other things  to enhance the board s ability to protect shareholder interests and to ensure that shareholders receive fair treatment in the event any coercive takeover attempt of us is made in the future 
the shareholder rights plan could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or could discourage a third party from acquiring  us or a large block of our common stock

the rights currently are not exercisable and are attached to and trade with the outstanding shares of 
table of contents common stock 
under the shareholder rights plan  the rights become exercisable if a person or group becomes an acquiring person by acquiring or more of the outstanding shares of common stock or if a person or group commences a tender offer that would result in that person owning or more of the common stock 
if a person or group becomes an acquiring person  each holder of a right other than the acquiring person would be entitled to purchase  at the then current exercise price  such number of shares of our preferred stock which are equivalent to shares of common stock having a value of twice the exercise price of the right 
if we are acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction after any such event  each holder of a right would then be entitled to purchase  at the then current exercise price  shares of the acquiring company s common stock having a value of twice the exercise price of the right

we have included future payments of interest on the long term debt in our obligations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements are based on the selection and application of generally accepted accounting principles  which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and any such differences may be material to our financial statements 
we believe that the policies set forth below may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application than our other accounting policies and represent the critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  the results could be materially different from our reported results 
we adopted the financial accounting standard board accounting standards codification in the year ended december  the fasb accounting standards codification codification has become the single source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap 
all existing accounting standard documents are superseded by the codification and any accounting literature not included in the codification will not be authoritative 
however  rules and interpretive releases of the securities and exchange commission sec issued under the authority of federal securities laws will continue to be sources of authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
all references made to gaap in our consolidated financial statements now use the new codification numbering system 
the codification does not change or alter existing gaap and  therefore  did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition we generate nearly all of our revenue from sales of our omnipod insulin management system to diabetes patients or third party distributors who resell the product to diabetes patients 
the initial sale to a new customer typically includes omnipods and a starter kit  which include the pdm  the omnipod system user guide and the omnipod system interactive training cd 
we offer a day right of return for our starter kits sales 
subsequent sales to existing customers typically consist of additional omnipods 
revenue recognition requires that persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  delivery of goods occurs through transfer of title and risk and rewards of ownership  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
with respect to these criteria the evidence of an arrangement generally consists of a physician order form  a patient information form  and if applicable  third party insurance approval for sales directly to patients or a purchase order for sales to a third party distributor 
transfer of title and risk and rewards of ownership are typically passed to the patient or third party distributor upon shipment of the products 
the selling prices for all sales are fixed and agreed with the patient or third party distributor  and if applicable  the patient s third party insurance provider s prior to shipment and are based on established list prices or  in the case of certain third party insurers  contractually agreed upon prices 
provisions for discounts and rebates to customers are established as a reduction to revenue in the same period the related sales are recorded 
we assess whether the different elements qualify for separate accounting 
we recognize revenue for the initial shipment to a patient or other third party once all elements have been delivered 
we offer a day right of return for our starter kits sales  and we defer revenue to reflect estimated sales returns in the same period that the related product sales are recorded 
returns are estimated through a comparison of historical return data to their related sales 
historical rates of return are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace when appropriate 
historically  sales returns have amounted to approximately of initial sales to new customers 
when doubt exists about reasonable assuredness of collectibility from specific customers  we defer revenue from sales of products to those customers until payment is received 
restructuring expense and impairment of assets as part of our efforts to pursue improved gross margins  leverage operational efficiencies and better pursue opportunities for low cost supplier sourcing of asset costs  we periodically perform an evaluation of our manufacturing processes and review the carrying value of our property and equipment to assess the recoverability of these assets whenever events indicate that impairment may have occurred 
as part of this assessment  we review the planned use of the assets as well as the future undiscounted operating cash flows expected to be generated by those assets 
if impairment is indicated through this review  the carrying amount of the asset would be reduced to its estimated fair value 
this review of manufacturing processes and equipment can result in restructuring activity or an impairment of assets based on current net book value and potential future use of the assets 
our restructuring expenses may also include workforce reduction and related costs for one time termination benefits provided to employees who are involuntarily terminated under the terms of a one time benefit arrangement 
we record these one time termination benefits upon incurring the liability provided that the employees are notified  the plan is approved by the appropriate level of management  the employees to be terminated and the expected completion date are identified and the benefits the identified employees will be paid are established 
significant changes to the plan are not expected when we record the costs 
in recording the workforce reduction and related costs  we estimate related costs such as taxes and outplacement services which may be provided under the plan 
if changes in these estimated services occur  we may be required to record or reverse restructuring expenses associated with these workforce reduction and related costs 

table of contents asset valuation asset valuation includes assessing the recorded value of certain assets  including accounts receivable  inventory and fixed assets 
we use a variety of factors to assess valuation  depending upon the asset 
actual results may differ materially from our estimates 
inventories are held at the lower of their cost or market value 
we periodically review inventories for potential impairment based on quantities on hand and expectations of future use 
property and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets 
leasehold improvements are amortized over their useful life or the life of the lease  whichever is shorter 
we review long lived assets  including property and equipment and intangibles  for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
we also review assets under construction to ensure certainty of their future installation and integration into the manufacturing process 
an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition is less than its carrying amount 
impairment  if any  is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
we consider various valuation factors  principally planned use of the assets and discounted cash flows  to assess the fair values of long lived assets 
income taxes fasb asc  income taxes  clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements 
fasb asc prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
in addition  fasb asc provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
as of december   we had million of unrecognized tax benefits recorded 
as of december   we had million of unrecognized tax benefits recorded 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation under the provisions of fasb asc  compensation stock compensation 
fasb asc requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
we have continued to apply the minimum value method in future periods to equity awards outstanding that were originally measured using this method 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the weighted average fair value of options granted 
we determine the intrinsic value of restricted stock and restricted stock units based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant 
we recognize the compensation expense of share based awards on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the award 
the determination of the fair value of share based payment awards utilizing the black scholes model is affected by the stock price and a number of assumptions  including expected volatility  expected life  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
because our initial public offering was completed in may  we do not have sufficient history of market prices of our common stock  and as such we estimate volatility in accordance with securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment  or sab  using historical volatilities of comparable public entities 
the expected life of the awards is estimated based on the sec shortcut approach as defined in sab  which is the midpoint between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates appropriate for the terms of the awards 
the dividend yield assumption is based on company history and expectation of paying no dividends 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
stock based compensation expense recognized in the financial statements is based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
we evaluate the assumptions used to value the awards on a quarterly basis and if factors change and different assumptions are utilized  stock based compensation expense may differ significantly from what has been recorded in the past 
if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities  
table of contents we may be required to accelerate  increase or cancel any remaining unearned stock based compensation expense 
prior to april   the exercise prices for options granted were set by our board of directors based upon guidance set forth by the american institute of certified public accountants in the aicpa technical practice aid 
to that end  the board considered a number of factors in determining the option price  including the following factors prices for our preferred stock  which we had sold to outside investors in arms length transactions  and the rights  preferences and privileges of our preferred stock and common stock in the series a through series e financing  obtaining fda k clearance  launching the omnipod system and achievement of budgeted revenue and results 
in connection with the preparation of the financial statements for our initial public offering  we retrospectively estimated the fair value of our common stock based upon several factors  including the following operating and financial performance  progress and milestones attained in the business  past sales of convertible preferred stock  the results of the retrospective independent valuations  and the expected valuation obtained in an initial public offering 
we believe this to have been a reasonable methodology based on the factors above and based on several arm s length transactions involving our stock supportive of the results produced by this valuation methodology 
in the years ended december    and  we recorded million  million and million of stock based compensation expense  respectively 
warrants in connection with the term loans with lighthouse capital partners in and a group of lenders led by merrill lynch capital in  we issued warrants to the lenders to purchase shares of our redeemable convertible preferred stock 
upon the closing of our initial public offering in may  all outstanding warrants to purchase shares of our preferred stock were converted into warrants to purchase shares of our common stock on a for basis at a purchase price of per share and  as a result  are no longer be subject to fsp for periods ended on or after that date 
the aggregate fair value of these warrants as of may   determined to be million  was reclassified from liabilities to additional paid in capital  a component of stockholders equity  and we have ceased to record any related periodic fair value adjustments 
we recorded million fair value of the warrants for series e preferred stock as a discount to the term loan with merrill lynch capital 
the value of the warrants was being amortized to interest expense over the month life of this term loan 
upon repayment and termination of the term loan in june  we recognized approximately million as interest expense for the unamortized balance of the warrants fair value 
in connection with the million initial disbursement related to the execution of the facility agreement in march  we issued to the lenders fully exercisable warrants to purchase an aggregate of million shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
we recorded million fair value as additional paid in capital and debt discount and were amortizing this amount to interest expense over the term of the loan 
in the year ended december   these warrants were exercised to purchase  shares of our common stock 
we received proceeds of million in connection with the warrant exercise 
significant terms and fair values of warrants to purchase common stock are as follows in thousands except share and per share data exercise common shares as of fair value as of expiration price december  december  december  december  stock date per share common stock december    accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable consist of amounts due from third party payors  patients and third party distributors 
we account for doubtful accounts using the allowance method 
the allowances for doubtful accounts are recorded in the period in which the revenue is recorded or at the time the potential collection risk is identified 

table of contents we estimate our allowance based on historical experience  assessment of specific risk  discussions with individual customers or various assumptions and estimates that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
at december  and  the allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million  respectively 
we believe the reserve is adequate to mitigate current collection risk 
warranty we provide a four year warranty on our pdms and may replace any omnipods that do not function in accordance with product specifications 
we estimate our warranty at the time the product is shipped based on historical experience and the estimated cost to service the claims 
cost to service the claims reflects the current product cost which has been decreasing over time 
as these estimates are based on historical experience  and we continue to introduce new products and new versions of existing products  we also consider the anticipated performance of the product over its warranty period in estimating warranty reserves 
at december  and  the warranty reserve was million 
recent accounting pronouncements in april  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
thereby amending fasb asc for revenue recognition related to the milestone method of revenue recognition 
asu no 
provides guidance on defining a milestone and determining when it may be appropriate to apply the milestone method of revenue recognition for research or development arrangements 
a company may make an accounting policy election to use the milestone method of revenue recognition for transactions within the scope of the amendments 
the amendments will be effective in fiscal years beginning on or after june  we will adopt the amendments on january  on a prospective basis 
we believe the adoption of asu no 
will have no material effect on our financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued asu no 
formerly emerging issues task force  or eitf  no 
on asc for revenue recognition related to multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
asu no 
provides amendments to the existing criteria for separating consideration in multiple deliverable arrangements 
the amendments establish a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable  eliminate the residual method of allocation of arrangement consideration to all deliverables and require the use of the relative selling price method in the allocation of arrangement consideration to all deliverables  require the determination of the best estimate of a selling price in a consistent manner  and significantly expand the disclosures related to the multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
the amendments will be effective in fiscal years beginning on or after june   and early adoption is permitted 
we will adopt the amendments on january  on a prospective basis 
we believe the adoption of asu no 
will have no material effect on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio and have no foreign exchange contracts 
our financial instruments consist of cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  accounts receivable  accounts payable  accrued expenses and long term obligations 
we consider investments that  when purchased  have a remaining maturity of days or less to be cash equivalents 
the primary objectives of our investment strategy are to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields 
to minimize our exposure to an adverse shift in interest rates  we invest mainly in cash equivalents and short term investments and maintain an average maturity of six months or less 
we do not believe that a change in interest rates would have a material impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio or our interest income 
on december   we had outstanding debt recorded at million related to our notes 
as the interest rate on the notes is fixed  changes in interest rates do not affect the value of our debt or interest expense
