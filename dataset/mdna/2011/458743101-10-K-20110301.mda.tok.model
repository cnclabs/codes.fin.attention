average organic daily sales are defined as sales for a period of time divided by the number of shipping days in that period of time excluding any sales from acquisitions made subsequent to the beginning of the prior year period 
for a reconciliation of average organic daily sales growth to us gaap based financial measures  see selected financial data reconciliation of average organic daily sales to net sales 
fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  overview 
during  our sales increased  organic sales increased  and average organic daily sales decreased 
sales to customers in our facilities maintenance end market  which makes up of our total sales  increased  including our cleansource acquisition  excluding our cleansource acquisition  organic sales increased and our average organic daily sales decreased 
sales to our professional contractor customers  which represent of our total sales  increased in total and decreased on an average organic daily sales basis 
sales to our specialty distributor customers  which represent of our total sales  increased in total and increased on an average organic daily sales basis 
we believe our average organic daily sales decrease is associated with the well publicized general economic downturn over the last few years 
although we are starting to see signs of stabilization  demand from certain customers continues to be negatively impacted by lower levels of residential new 
table of contents construction and renovations activity as well as governmental and educational budget constraints 
we expect continued variability within our end markets  however  we believe the impact on sales related to the market weakness during will be less severe than we experienced during we expect sales to our customers to increase modestly during as limited and uneven economic improvements occur across our end markets 
operating income as a percentage of net sales was in compared to in the increase in operating income as a percentage of sales is primarily a result of higher gross profit margins and lower salary and wages expense  lower bad debt expense and lower occupancy related expenses  offset in part by higher fringe benefits and variable compensation expenses as well as higher depreciation and amortization expense

in light of the current economic conditions  we continue to evaluate the cost and benefits associated with these cost control measures 
we are continuing to focus on keeping operating costs as a percentage of sales low while also investing in our operating platform for the long term 
accordingly  our plans include continued investments in the consolidation of our distribution network and in information technology solutions

we have also increased our accounts receivable reserve to adjust for higher levels of risk in our portfolio stemming from an unprecedented market and credit environment 
these costs were partially offset by the cost savings derived from the reduction in workforce in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of  the closing of underperforming professional contractor centers and consolidation of certain distribution centers during the last six months of and the first nine months of  and various other efforts aimed at reducing costs

this compares to the million we derecognized related to uncertain tax positions during seasonality we experience some seasonal fluctuations as sales of our products typically increase in the second and third fiscal quarters of the year due to increased apartment turnover and related maintenance and repairs in the multi family residential housing sector during these periods 
typically  november  december and january sales are lower across most of our brands because customers may defer purchases at year end as their budget limits are met and because of the winter holiday season between thanksgiving day and new year day
