overview we encourage you to read this management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes 
the fiscal years ended january  fiscal  january  fiscal and january  fiscal each consisted of weeks 
executive summary net loss for fiscal was million  or per share  compared with a net loss of million  or per share  for fiscal net loss for fiscal includes impairment charges of million  or per share 
net loss for fiscal included a million non cash income tax charge  or per share  related to a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets  a million after tax charge  or per share  related to the separation from our former ceo  and a million non cash charge  or per share  related to premium retail store asset impairments 
net sales decreased to million in fiscal compared to  million in fiscal this percent decrease in net sales for the year was primarily driven by a decrease in comparable premium retail store sales of percent in our retail segment and a decrease in our direct segment sales of percent 
gross profit for fiscal was million  or percent of net sales  compared with million  or percent of net sales  in fiscal the basis point decline in gross profit margin was primarily due to deleveraging of occupancy expenses  offsetting a slight improvement in merchandise margins 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal were million  or percent of net sales  compared with million  or percent of net sales  for fiscal the decline in sg a was primarily related to lower employee related and marketing expenses and other fixed and variable costs 
we define comparable premium retail stores as those stores in which the gross square footage has not changed by more than percent in the previous months and which have been open for at least consecutive months provided that store has been considered comparable for the entire quarter without closure for seven consecutive days or moving to a different temporary or permanent location 
due to the extensive promotions that occur as part of the opening of a premium store  we believe waiting sixteen months rather than twelve months to consider a store to be comparable provides a better view of the growth pattern of the premium retail store base 
the calculation of comparable store sales varies across the retail industry and as a result  the calculations of other retail companies may not be consistent with our calculation 

table of contents we ended fiscal with million in cash and cash equivalents  compared to million at the prior year end 
working capital was million at the end of fiscal  compared to million at the end of fiscal premium retail inventory  including the retail inventory in our distribution center  decreased percent per square foot compared to fiscal total inventory decreased percent to million at the end fiscal from million at the end of fiscal company initiatives we believe that the most important change we need to make in order to improve our sales and profitability is to offer our core and target customer an assortment that she finds more appealing 
we recognize that our target customer style orientation has changed over the last several years  and that our collections have not evolved to meet her needs 
we have talked extensively to our customer to better understand her needs and what she expects from coldwater creek 
our findings have consistently told us that  among other things  a color is important to her and she is looking for colors that are seasonally appropriate  b she finds the bold prints and patterns we have offered in the past too matronly  c she looks to us for jackets in flattering silhouettes that give her shape and d she wants versatility in her wardrobe 
we have made significant changes at all levels of our merchandising and creative teams to better address the needs of both our core and target customer demographic 
most recently  we announced that jill dean has joined us as president and chief merchandising officer 
in addition to a select number of internal promotions within our merchandising team  we have recently added two senior level merchants for both our retail and direct businesses 
additionally  jerome jessup was promoted to president and chief creative officer 
under jerome jessup leadership  we have added new talent to our new york design center specifically in the areas of product design and development  fabric research and development  and in the design leadership of several key categories including sweaters and pants 
we have also added key senior level talent in product development focusing on fit as well as our wovens business 
we believe that we now have the right people in place to enable us to reinvigorate our product assortment and reposition our brand to better address the needs of our target demographic 
for fiscal  we are focused on three primary objectives improving our financial performance  elevating the appeal of our product  and revitalizing our brand perception 
we are intensely focused on improving our financial performance 
we continue to look for ways to further reduce expenses and expect to see some further reductions in our biggest opportunity for improvement in financial performance is to restore our gross margin through improved full price sales 
we continue to analyze our inventory buys and believe there is additional room to adjust our inventory commitments as we move through the year 
we have also evaluated our promotional and markdown strategy and will continue to offer shorter sale events 
we will also continue to offer a full time sale section in our premium stores  which we began in the third quarter of we believe this will enable us to clear excess inventory more profitably than through our outlet stores and in the clearance section of our website 
in addition  in our outlet stores  which have historically been used for clearing excess inventory only  we will begin testing product made exclusively for this channel 
we expect that this will enable us to realize better gross margins for this business 
to elevate the appeal of our assortment  we are focused on rebuilding several of our key merchandising categories 
we are working to restore our jacket business by offering more variety in lengths and silhouettes 
in we will roll out the next stage of our pant fit initiative which focuses on providing consistency in our fits across all of our pant offerings 
we believe that there is a significant opportunity to expand our pant offering to cater to other aspects of our customers 
table of contents wardrobing needs 
we are also introducing a wear to work style orientation to our collection that offers her the versatility she is looking for in pants and tops  as well as re establishing our skirt and dress businesses 
we recognize that we need to reposition the coldwater creek brand and communicate to our customer that we are changing 
in this regard  our catalog is our most important vehicle to reach our customer and we are refining our creative presentations to convey this message 
we are also investing in national magazine ads throughout to reach our target customers and communicate our new brand aesthetic 
we are in a transition period and it may take time for our core and target customers to respond to the changes we are making  however  we believe that these changes will position us for improved long term performance 
outlook our operating results for fiscal were negatively impacted by our fall and holiday merchandise assortments which were not well received by our customers 
we expect the product acceptance challenges we experienced with our fall and holiday assortments to continue in the near term 
in addition  weakness in consumer spending persists as a result of continued uncertain macroeconomic conditions reflected in reduced incomes  high unemployment and deterioration in household net worth 
we believe these conditions continue to have a negative impact on our sales  gross margin and operating performance 
as long as these conditions continue  we expect that consumer spending will remain subdued 
as such  we will continue our focus on expense and inventory control 
during fiscal  we made significant efforts to clear excess inventory by utilizing promotional events in our stores  outlets  and on our web site 
we also began offering a full time sale section at all of our premium retail stores 
for fiscal  we will maintain our disciplined management of inventory levels through tighter inventory buys 
as such  we expect total inventory at the end of the first quarter of fiscal to be down in the mid to high single digit percent range compared to our inventory level at the end of the first quarter of fiscal we have recently seen an increase in sourcing costs such as raw materials  freight and labor 
we continue to work to mitigate cost pressures by refining our sourcing strategies through vendor consolidation and material diversification  although we do not believe that it will be enough to offset the cost pressures we are facing  and we expect to pass some of these costs to consumers via select price increases 
however  it will be necessary to absorb some of these cost pressures internally and  as a result  we believe our initial merchandise markups will decrease by to basis points for the fall assortment 
other developments on january   we amended our credit agreement with wells fargo retail finance  llc  to extend the maturity date one additional year to february  the major terms of the agreement and the amount available under the facility were unchanged by the amendment

seasonality as with many apparel retailers  our net sales  results of operations  liquidity and cash flows have fluctuated  and will continue to fluctuate  as a result of a number of factors  including the following the composition  size and timing of various merchandise offerings  the timing and number of premium retail store openings and closings  the timing and number of promotions  the timing and number of catalog mailings  customer response to merchandise offerings  including the impact of economic and weather related influences  the actions of competitors and similar factors  the ability to accurately estimate and accrue for merchandise returns and the costs of obsolete inventory  market price fluctuations in critical materials and services  including paper  production  postage and telecommunications costs  the timing of merchandise shipping and receiving  including any delays resulting from labor strikes or slowdowns  adverse weather conditions  health epidemics or national security measures  and shifts in the timing of important holiday selling seasons relative to our fiscal quarters  including valentine day  easter  mother day  thanksgiving and christmas 
our results continue to depend materially on sales and profits from the november and december holiday shopping season 
in anticipation of traditionally increased holiday sales activity  we incur certain significant incremental expenses  including the hiring of a substantial number of temporary employees to supplement our existing workforce 
additionally  as gift items and accessories are more prominently represented in the november and december holiday season merchandise offerings  we typically expect  absent offsetting factors  to realize higher consolidated gross margins and earnings in the second half of our fiscal year 
liquidity and capital resources in recent fiscal years  we financed ongoing operations and growth initiatives primarily from cash flow generated by operations and trade credit arrangements 
however  as we produce catalogs  open retail stores and purchase inventory in anticipation of future sales realization  and as we experience operating cash flows and working capital fluctuations  we may occasionally need to utilize our secured credit facility 
our credit facility with wells fargo retail finance  llc  which is secured primarily by our inventory and credit card receivables  provides a revolving line of credit up to million  with subfacilities for the issuance of up to million in letters of credit and swingline advances of up to million 
the credit facility has a maturity date of february  the actual amount of credit that is available from time to time under the credit facility is limited to a borrowing base amount that is determined according to  among other things  a percentage of the value of eligible inventory plus a percentage of the value of eligible credit card receivables  as reduced by certain reserve amounts that may be required by the lender

the credit facility generally contains customary events of default for credit facilities of this type 
upon an event of default that is not cured or waived within any applicable cure periods  in addition to other remedies that may be available to the lender  the obligations under the credit facility may be accelerated  outstanding letters of credit may be required to be cash collateralized and remedies may be exercised against the collateral 
net cash used in operating activities was million during fiscal compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million and million during fiscal years and  respectively 
the million decrease in cash flows from operating activities during fiscal as compared with fiscal resulted primarily from decreased net sales and gross margins as well as a decrease in tax refunds received of million 
we also experienced decreases of million and million in cash collected on tenant allowances and fees collected from the co branded credit card program  respectively 
these decreases were offset by lower operating expenses 
in addition  we made a cash severance payment of million to our former ceo during fiscal the million decrease in cash flows from operating activities in fiscal from resulted primarily from decreased gross margins and increased payments on inventory purchases 
we also experienced a decrease in cash collected on tenant allowances of million as total cash collected on tenant allowances was million during fiscal as compared to million during fiscal in addition  we made a cash severance payment of million to our former ceo and we experienced a million decrease in interest income collected during fiscal these decreases were offset by lower operating expenses  reduced marketing costs and an increase of million in fees collected from the co branded credit card program  which includes a million payment received related to the revenue sharing component of our co branded credit card program and a million increase in tax refunds received 
cash outflows from investing activities principally consisted of capital expenditures which totaled million  million and million during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
capital expenditures in fiscal primarily related to leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures associated with the opening of additional premium retail stores  four merchandise clearance outlet stores and to a lesser extent the remodeling of certain existing stores and the expansion of our it infrastructure 
capital expenditures in fiscal primarily related to leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures associated with the opening of eight additional premium retail stores  two merchandise clearance outlet stores  two premium retail stores under construction  the remodeling of certain existing stores  the relocation of our new york design office  and the expansion of our it and distribution infrastructure

during fiscal  cash inflows of million related to stock option exercises  purchases of shares under our employee stock purchase plan and tax benefits related to the exercise of stock options were offset by million in cash outflows related to payments on our capital lease and other financing obligations and tax withholding payments made on restricted stock units 
as a result of the foregoing  we had million in working capital at january   compared with million in working capital at january  our current ratio was at january  compared with at january  we plan to limit new store openings in fiscal to five stores to which we have previously committed and to close between eight and stores 
as a result  our capital expenditures in will be substantially lower than our capital expenditures in fiscal capital expenditures for the full year in fiscal are expected to be between million and million 
we do not anticipate borrowing under our credit facility during fiscal as we believe cash flow from operations and current cash on hand will be sufficient to fund current needs 
however  lower than expected sales or lower merchandise margins that negatively impact our cash flows could require us to borrow under our credit facility 
it is also possible that should we need to access our credit facility  it may not be available in full  or at all  for future borrowings  due to borrowing base and other limitations 
off balance sheet liabilities and other contractual obligations we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined by item a of regulation s k 
the following tables summarize our minimum contractual commitments and commercial obligations as of january  payments due in fiscal year total thereafter in thousands contractual obligations operating leases a c contractual commitments b capital leases c other long term liabilities d total a we have a significant operating lease for our  square foot distribution center and customer contact center located in mineral wells  west virginia  with a remaining lease commitment as of january  of million 
all other operating leases primarily pertain to retail and outlet stores  day spas and various equipment 
certain store leases have provisions to adjust the payment based on certain criteria  for example additional rent for our store sales above a specified minimum or less rent based on landlord vacancy rates below a specified minimum 
the operating lease obligations noted

several lease agreements provide renewal options or allow for termination rights under certain circumstances 
future operating lease obligations would change if these renewal options or termination rights were exercised 
b contractual commitments include commitments to purchase inventory of million and capital expenditures of million 
the timing of the payments is subject to change based upon actual receipt of the inventory or capital asset and the terms of payment with the vendor 
c the primary capital lease is for our  square foot facility located in coeur d alene  idaho  which functions as a customer contact center  it data center  and office space 
this lease was amended on april  resulting in the lease classified as a capital lease through fiscal  with a remaining lease commitment as of january  of million  and as an operating lease from fiscal through fiscal  with a remaining lease commitment as of january  of million 
all other capital leases pertain to various technology equipment and other real estate 
the capital lease obligations represent the minimum payments including principal and interest  and excluding maintenance  insurance and real estate taxes 
d other long term liabilities primarily include amounts representing obligations under our supplemental employee retirement plan of million 
the timing of cash flows associated with these obligations is subject to change based upon circumstances not necessarily within our control 
unrecognized tax benefits as of january  of million are expected to be resolved within the next months but are not included in the contractual obligations table presented above because the timing of the settlement of unrecognized tax benefits cannot be fully determined 
critical accounting policies and estimates preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
note to our consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments  because of the significance to our consolidated financial statements  result primarily from the need to make estimates about effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the most significant areas involving management judgments are described below 
actual results in these areas could differ from management estimates 
sales returns we recognize sales and the related cost of sales for our direct segment at the time the merchandise is expected to be delivered to our customer and for our retail segment at the point of sale with a customer in a store 
we reduce our sales and costs of sales and establish an accrual for expected sales returns based on historical experience and future expectations 
the ability to reasonably estimate sales returns is made more complex by the fact that we offer our customers a return policy whereby they may return merchandise for any reason and at any time without any restrictions as to condition or time of purchase to any of our locations 
the actual amount of sales returns we subsequently realize may fluctuate from estimates due to several factors  including size and fit  merchandise mix  actual or perceived quality  differences between the actual product and its presentation in the catalog or web site  timeliness of delivery and competitive offerings 
we continually track subsequent sales return experience  compile customer feedback to identify any pervasive issues  reassess the marketplace  
table of contents compare our findings to previous estimates and adjust the sales return accrual and cost of sales accordingly 
provisions for sales returns were as follows fiscal year ended january  january  january  in thousands balance at beginning of period additions charged to income deductions for actual returns adjustments recorded to income balance at end of period inventory reserves our inventories consist of merchandise purchased for resale and are recorded at the lower of cost or market 
the nature of our business requires that we make substantially all of our merchandising and marketing decisions and corresponding inventory purchase commitments with vendors several months in advance of the time in which a particular merchandise item is intended to be included in the merchandise offerings 
these decisions and commitments are based upon  among other possible considerations  historical sales with identical or similar merchandise  our understanding of then prevailing fashion trends and influences  and an assessment of likely economic conditions and various competitive factors 
we continually make assessments as to whether the carrying cost of inventory exceeds its market value  and  if so  by what dollar amount 
to determine whether inventory should be written down we consider current and anticipated demand and customer preferences in addition to the current and future estimated selling price 
the carrying value of the inventory is reduced to its net realizable value with a corresponding charge to cost of sales 
actual results may differ from our estimates if we are required to markdown or discount merchandise beyond our current expectations 
for slow moving or obsolete inventory marked down to net realizable value  a one percentage point increase in our reserve at january  would have affected net loss by less than million 
we estimate our physical inventory losses that have occurred since our last physical inventory date by applying the most recent average physical inventory loss experience 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our inventory loss reserve 
however  if our estimates regarding physical inventory losses are inaccurate  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
stock based compensation the calculation of stock based compensation expense requires us to expense the fair value of equity awards over the requisite employee service period  which is generally the vesting period 
calculating the fair value of stock options on the date of grant requires judgment  including estimating the expected life of the award  the expected stock price volatility over the expected life and pre vesting forfeitures 
our expected stock price volatility assumption is based upon a combination of both the implied and historical volatilities of our stock which is obtained from public data sources 
the expected life represents the weighted average period of time that stock options are expected to be outstanding  giving consideration to vesting schedules and historical exercise patterns 
if expected volatility or expected life were to increase  that would result in an increase in the fair value of our stock options resulting in higher compensation charges  while a decrease in expected volatility or expected life would result in a lower fair value of our stock options resulting in lower compensation charges 
we also grant various restricted stock units which are generally less subjective in determining fair value as the fair 
table of contents value of these awards is based primarily upon the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant 
we estimate forfeitures for all of our equity awards based upon historical experience  and only recognize expense for those awards expected to vest 
we revise our estimated forfeitures in subsequent periods  when necessary  if actual forfeitures vary from those originally estimated 
we believe that our estimates are based upon outcomes that are reasonably likely to occur 
if actual forfeitures vary from our estimates  compensation expense would vary from what we record in the current and prior fiscal years 
total stock based compensation expense during fiscal  and was million  million and million  respectively 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets are subject to a review for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
if the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows generated by an asset or asset group is less than its carrying amount  we then determine the fair value of the asset generally by using a discounted cash flow model 
a loss is recognized  if any  equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the fair value 
in assessing future cash flows  management is required to make assumptions and judgments  including forecasting future sales  margins and operating expenses over the estimated remaining useful life 
these assumptions and judgments can be affected by consumer spending and overall economic conditions on a localized or regional basis  as well as other factors not necessarily within our control 
during fiscal  we experienced a decrease in consumer spending and low traffic levels which had a negative impact on our revenue  gross margins  operating cash flows and earnings  resulting in our need to evaluate certain asset groups for impairment 
during fiscal  we recorded impairment charges of million related to the long lived assets of certain premium retail stores  day spas and other computer software 
a decrease in our expected future cash flows of percent throughout the forecast period would have increased our fiscal store impairment charges by less than million 
during fiscal and  we recorded impairment charges of million and million  respectively  related to the long lived assets at certain retail stores 
if consumer spending on apparel and accessories remains subdued with low demand for our product  it is possible that we could record additional impairments of certain long lived assets in the future 
contingent liabilities an estimated loss from a contingency is charged to income if it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
gain contingencies are not recorded until realized 
we are involved in litigation and administrative proceedings arising in the normal course of our business 
actions filed against us from time to time include commercial  intellectual property infringement  customer and employment claims  including class action lawsuits alleging that we violated federal and state wage and hour and other laws 
the assessment of the outcome of litigation can be very difficult to predict as it is subject to many factors  including those not within our control  and is highly dependent on individual facts and circumstances 
litigation is subject to highly complex legal processes and the final outcome of these matters could vary significantly from the amounts that have been recorded in the financial statements 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and 
table of contents respective tax bases  as measured by enacted tax rates that are expected to be in effect in the periods where deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled 
assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets requires significant judgment 
we consider all available evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become realizable 
in making such judgments  significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
current or previous losses are given more weight than projected future performance 
consequently  based on all available evidence  in particular our three year historical cumulative losses and recent operating losses  we have a valuation allowance against a significant portion of our net deferred tax assets 
when the results of our operations demonstrate a sustained level of taxable income it may become more likely than not that all or a part of the net deferred tax assets will be realized which could result in the reduction of the valuation allowance 
the determination of when to reduce a valuation allowance requires significant judgment by management in determining the appropriate level of evidence to objectively support the realization of the net deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance activity on net deferred tax assets was as follows fiscal year ended january  january  january  in thousands balance at beginning of period net additions charged to income tax expense other adjustments to comprehensive income balance at end of period recently issued accounting standards see note to our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have not been materially impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as substantially all of our business is transacted in us dollars or us dollar based currencies 
as of january   we did not have borrowings under our credit facility and  consequently  did not have any material exposure to interest rate market risks during or at the end of this period 
however  as any future borrowings under our amended and restated bank credit facility will be at a variable rate of interest  we could potentially be materially adversely impacted should we require significant borrowings in the future  particularly during a period of rising interest rates 
we have not used  and currently do not anticipate using  any derivative financial instruments
