results of operations comparison of year ended december  and december  investment income for the year ended december   total investment income was million  a increase from million of total investment income for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in total loan interest  fee and dividend income and a million increase in total pik interest income due to a net increase in our portfolio investments from december  to december   partially offset by a million decrease in interest income from cash and cash equivalent investments due to a decrease in average cash balances in over due to the increased deployment of cash for purchases of portfolio investments

financing transactions due to the fund and fund ii s status as licensed sbics  the fund and fund ii have the ability to issue debentures guaranteed by the sba at favorable interest rates 
under the small business investment act and the sba rules applicable to sbics  an sbic or group of sbics under common control can have outstanding at any time debentures guaranteed by the sba in an amount up to two times and in certain cases  up to three times the amount of its regulatory capital  which generally is the amount raised from private investors 
the maximum statutory limit on the dollar amount of outstanding debentures guaranteed by the sba issued by a single sbic is currently million and by a group of sbics under common control is million 

table of contents debentures guaranteed by the sba have a maturity of ten years  with interest payable semi annually

distributions to stockholders we have elected to be treated as a ric under subchapter m of the internal revenue code of  as amended  or the code  and intend to make the required distributions to our stockholders as specified therein 
in order to qualify as a ric and to obtain ric tax benefits  we must meet certain minimum distribution  source of income and asset diversification requirements 
if such requirements are met  then we are generally required to pay income taxes only on the portion of our taxable income and gains we do not distribute actually or constructively and certain built in gains 
we met our minimum distribution requirements for  and and continually monitor our distribution requirements with the goal of ensuring compliance with the code 
the minimum distribution requirements applicable to rics require us to distribute to our stockholders at least of our investment company taxable income  or icti  as defined by the code  each year 
depending on the level of icti earned in a tax year  we may choose to carry forward icti in excess of current year distributions into the next tax year and pay a excise tax on such excess 
any such carryover icti must be distributed before the end that next tax year through a dividend declared prior to filing the final tax return related to the year which generated such icti 
icti generally differs from net investment income for financial reporting purposes due to temporary and permanent differences in the recognition of income and expenses 
we may be required to recognize icti in certain circumstances in which we do not receive cash 
for example  if we hold debt obligations that are treated under applicable tax rules as having original issue discount such as debt instruments issued with warrants  we must include in icti each year a portion of the original issue discount that accrues over the life of the obligation  regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same taxable year 
we may also have to include in icti other amounts that we have not yet received in cash  such as pik interest income and interest income from investments that have been classified as non accrual for financial reporting purposes 
interest income on non accrual investments is not recognized for financial reporting purposes  but generally is recognized in icti 
because any original issue discount or other amounts accrued will be included in our icti for the year of accrual  we may be required to make a distribution to our stockholders in order to satisfy the minimum distribution requirements  even though we will not have received and may not ever receive any corresponding cash amount 
icti also excludes net unrealized appreciation or depreciation  as investment gains or losses are not included in taxable income until they are realized 
current market conditions beginning in  the debt and equity capital markets in the united states were severely impacted by significant write offs in the financial services sector relating to subprime mortgages and the re pricing of credit risk in the broadly syndicated bank loan market  among other factors 
these events  along with the 
table of contents deterioration of the housing market  led to an economic recession in the us and abroad 
banks  investment companies and others in the financial services industry reported significant write downs in the fair value of their assets  which led to the failure of a number of banks and investment companies  a number of distressed mergers and acquisitions  the government take over of the nation s two largest government sponsored mortgage companies  the passage of the billion emergency economic stabilization act of in october and the passage of the american recovery and reinvestment act of the stimulus bill in february these events significantly impacted the financial and credit markets and reduced the availability of debt and equity capital for the market as a whole  and for financial firms in particular 
notwithstanding recent gains across both the equity and debt markets  these conditions may continue for a prolonged period of time or worsen in the future 
although we have been able to secure access to additional liquidity  including our recent public stock offering  and increased leverage available through the sbic program as a result of the stimulus bill  there is no assurance that debt or equity capital will be available to us in the future on favorable terms  or at all 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods covered by such financial statements 
we have identified investment valuation and revenue recognition as our most critical accounting estimates 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to the matters described below 
these estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
a discussion of our critical accounting policies follows 
investment valuation the most significant estimate inherent in the preparation of our financial statements is the valuation of investments and the related amounts of unrealized appreciation and depreciation of investments recorded 
we have established and documented processes and methodologies for determining the fair values of portfolio company investments on a recurring quarterly basis in accordance with fasb asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures  or asc topic asc topic defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
as discussed below  we have engaged an independent valuation firm to assist us in our valuation process 
asc topic clarifies that the exchange price is the price in an orderly transaction between market participants to sell an asset or transfer a liability in the market in which the reporting entity would transact for the asset or liability  that is  the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability 
the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability is a hypothetical transaction at the measurement date  considered from the perspective of a market participant that holds the asset or owes the liability 
asc topic provides a consistent definition of fair value which focuses on exit price and prioritizes  within a measurement of fair value  the use of market based inputs over entity specific inputs 
in addition  asc topic provides a framework for measuring fair value and establishes a three level hierarchy for fair value measurements based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date 
the three levels of valuation hierarchy established by asc topic are defined as follows level inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active markets 
level inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets  and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly  for substantially the full term of the financial instrument 

table of contents level inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement 
a financial instrument s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
our investment portfolio is comprised of debt and equity instruments of privately held companies for which quoted prices falling within the categories of level and level inputs are not available 
therefore  we value all of our investments at fair value  as determined in good faith by our board of directors  using level inputs  as further described below 
due to the inherent uncertainty in the valuation process  our board of directors estimate of fair value may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the securities existed  and the differences could be material 
in addition  changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the valuations currently assigned 
debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded and for which a limited market does not exist are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors 
there is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith  as fair value depends upon circumstances of each individual case 
in general  fair value is the amount that we might reasonably expect to receive upon the current sale of the security 
we evaluate the investments in portfolio companies using the most recently available portfolio company financial statements and forecasts 
we also consult with the portfolio company s senior management to obtain further updates on the portfolio company s performance  including information such as industry trends  new product development and other operational issues 
additionally  we consider some or all of the following factors financial standing of the issuer of the security  comparison of the business and financial plan of the issuer with actual results  the size of the security held as it relates to the liquidity of the market for such security  pending public offering of common stock by the issuer of the security  pending reorganization activity affecting the issuer  such as merger or debt restructuring  ability of the issuer to obtain needed financing  changes in the economy affecting the issuer  financial statements and reports from portfolio company senior management and ownership  the type of security  the security s cost at the date of purchase and any contractual restrictions on the disposition of the security  discount from market value of unrestricted securities of the same class at the time of purchase  special reports prepared by analysts  information as to any transactions or offers with respect to the security and or sales to third parties of similar securities  the issuer s ability to make payments and the type of collateral  the current and forecasted earnings of the issuer  statistical ratios compared to lending standards and to other similar securities  and other pertinent factors 
in making the good faith determination of the value of debt securities  we start with the cost basis of the security  which includes the amortized original issue discount  and pik interest  if any 
we also use a risk rating system to estimate the probability of default on the debt securities and the probability of loss if there is 
table of contents a default 
the risk rating system covers both qualitative and quantitative aspects of the business and the securities held 
in valuing debt securities  management utilizes an income approach model that considers factors including  but not limited to  i the portfolio investment s current risk rating  ii the portfolio company s current trailing twelve months  or ttm  results of operations as compared to the portfolio company s ttm results of operations as of the date the investment was made and the portfolio company s anticipated results for the next twelve months of operations  iii the portfolio company s current leverage as compared to its leverage as of the date the investment was made  and iv publicly available information regarding current pricing and credit metrics for similar proposed and executed investment transactions of private companies and  v when management believes a relevant comparison exists  current pricing and credit metrics for similar proposed and executed investment transactions of publicly traded debt 
in valuing equity securities of private companies  we consider valuation methodologies consistent with industry practice  including but not limited to i valuation using a valuation model based on original transaction multiples and the portfolio company s recent financial performance  ii publicly available information regarding the valuation of the securities based on recent sales in comparable transactions of private companies and  iii when management believes there are comparable companies that are publicly traded  a review of these publicly traded companies and the market multiple of their equity securities 
duff phelps  llc  or duff phelps  an independent valuation firm  provides third party valuation consulting services to us  which consist of certain limited procedures that we identified and requested duff phelps to perform hereinafter referred to as the procedures 
we generally request duff phelps to perform the procedures on each portfolio company at least once in every calendar year and for new portfolio companies  at least once in the twelve month period subsequent to the initial investment 
in addition  we generally request duff phelps to perform the procedures on a portfolio company when there has been a significant change in the fair value of the investment 
in certain instances  we may determine that it is not cost effective  and as a result is not in our stockholders best interest  to request duff phelps to perform the procedures on one or more portfolio companies 
such instances include  but are not limited to  situations where the fair value of our investment in the portfolio company is determined to be insignificant relative to our total investment portfolio 
the total number of investments and the percentage of our portfolio that we asked duff phelps to perform such procedures are summarized below by period percent of total total investments at for the quarter ended companies fair value march  june  september  december  march  june  september  december  march  june  september  december  exclusive of the fair value of new investments made during the quarter upon completion of the procedures  duff phelps concluded that the fair value  as determined by the board of directors  of those investments subjected to the procedures did not appear to be unreasonable 
our 
table of contents board of directors is ultimately and solely responsible for determining the fair value of our investments in good faith 
revenue recognition interest and dividend income interest income  adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of original issue discount  is recorded on the accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected 
generally  when interest and or principal payments on a loan become past due  or if we otherwise do not expect the borrower to be able to service its debt and other obligations  we will place the loan on non accrual status and will generally cease recognizing interest income on that loan for financial reporting purposes until all principal and interest have been brought current through payment or due to a restructuring such that the interest income is deemed to be collectible 
we write off any previously accrued and uncollected interest when it is determined that interest is no longer considered collectible 
dividend income is recorded on the ex dividend date 
fee income loan origination  facility  commitment  consent and other advance fees received in connection with the origination of a loan are recorded as deferred income and recognized as income over the term of the loan 
loan prepayment penalties and loan amendment fees are recorded into income when received 
any previously deferred fees are immediately recorded into income upon prepayment of the related loan 
payment in kind interest pik we currently hold  and we expect to hold in the future  some loans in our portfolio that contain a pik interest provision 
the pik interest  computed at the contractual rate specified in each loan agreement  is added to the principal balance of the loan  rather than being paid to us in cash  and is recorded as interest income 
thus  the actual collection of pik interest may be deferred until the time of debt principal repayment 
to maintain our status as a ric  this non cash source of income must be paid out to stockholders in the form of dividends  even though we have not yet collected the cash 
generally  when current cash interest and or principal payments on a loan become past due  or if we otherwise do not expect the borrower to be able to service its debt and other obligations  we will place the loan on non accrual status and will generally cease recognizing pik interest income on that loan for financial reporting purposes until all principal and interest has been brought current through payment or due to a restructuring such that the interest income is deemed to be collectible 
we write off any previously accrued and uncollected pik interest when it is determined that the pik interest is no longer collectible

table of contents quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the recent economic recession may continue to impact the broader financial and credit markets and may continue to reduce the availability of debt and equity capital for the market as a whole and financial firms in particular 
this reduction in spending has had an adverse effect on a number of the industries in which some of our portfolio companies operate  and on certain of our portfolio companies as well 
during  we experienced write downs in our portfolio  several of which were due to declines in the operating performance of certain portfolio companies 
during  we experienced a million increase in the fair value of our investment portfolio related to unrealized appreciation of investments 
as of december   the fair value of our non accrual assets was approximately million  which comprised approximately of the total fair value of our portfolio  and the cost of our non accrual assets was approximately million  or of the total cost of our portfolio 
in addition to these non accrual assets  as of december   we had  on a fair value basis  approximately million of debt investments  or of the total fair value of our portfolio  which were current with respect to scheduled principal and interest payments  but which were carried at less than cost 
the cost of these assets as of december  was approximately million  or of the total cost of our portfolio 
while the equity and debt markets have recently improved  these stressed conditions may continue for a prolonged period of time or worsen in the future 
in the event that the economy deteriorates further  the financial position and results of operations of certain of the middle market companies in our portfolio could be further affected adversely  which ultimately could lead to difficulty in our portfolio companies meeting debt service requirements and lead to an increase in defaults 
there can be no assurance that the performance of our portfolio companies will not be further impacted by economic conditions  which could have a negative impact on our future results 
in addition  we are subject to interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is defined as the sensitivity of our current and future earnings to interest rate volatility  variability of spread relationships  the difference in re pricing intervals between our assets and liabilities and the effect that interest rates may have on our cash flows 
changes in the general level of interest rates can affect our net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income earned on interest earning assets and our interest expense incurred in connection with our interest bearing debt and liabilities 
changes in interest rates can also affect  among other things  our ability to acquire and originate loans and securities and the value of our investment portfolio 
our investment income is affected by fluctuations in various interest rates  including libor and prime rates 
we regularly measure exposure to interest rate risk and determine whether or not any hedging transactions are necessary to mitigate exposure to changes in interest rates 
as of december   we were not a party to any hedging arrangements 
as of december   approximately  or million of our debt portfolio investments bore interest at fixed rates and approximately  or million of our debt portfolio investments bore interest at variable rates  which are either prime based or libor based 
a basis point increase or decrease in the interest rates on our variable rate debt investments would increase or decrease  as applicable  our investment income by approximately million on an annual basis 
all of our pooled sba guaranteed debentures bear interest at fixed rates 
because we currently borrow  and plan to borrow in the future  money to make investments  our net investment income is dependent upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest the funds borrowed 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income 
in periods of rising interest rates  our cost of funds would increase  which could reduce our net investment income if there is not a corresponding increase in interest income generated by our investment portfolio 
related party transactions during the three years ending december  there were no related party transactions between triangle capital corporation and any of its subsidiaries 

table of contents contractual obligations as of december   our future fixed commitments for cash payments are as follows to to and total thereafter sba guaranteed debentures payable interest due on sba guaranteed debentures payable unused commitments to extend credit operating lease payments total as of december  we had million of un pooled sba guaranteed debentures payable 
because these debentures are un pooled we do not have a fixed interest rate on the debentures at this time 
as a result  we have not included any estimated interest for the million in un pooled debentures as interest due on the sba guaranteed debentures payable in this table 
we have a commitment to extend credit  in the form of loans and additional equity contributions  to one of our portfolio companies which is undrawn as of december  since this commitment may expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements  however we have chosen to present the amount of this unused commitment as an obligation in this table
