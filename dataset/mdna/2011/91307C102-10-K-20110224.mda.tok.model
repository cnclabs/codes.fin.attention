manufacturing and supply we make treprostinil  the active ingredient for remodulin and tyvaso  and treprostinil diethanolamine  the active ingredient for oral treprostinil  at our facility in silver spring  maryland 
in june  the fda approved our silver spring facility for commercial manufacturing of treprostinil 
in november  we also received european regulatory approval to manufacture treprostinil in our silver spring facility 
in addition  we are currently developing the capacity to manufacture remodulin and tyvaso at our silver spring facility 
baxter healthcare corporation baxter manufactures remodulin for us 
in april  we amended our agreement with baxter to extend its term through in addition  we agreed that remodulin will be manufactured using a different set of equipment and in larger quantities than the current manufacturing process 
since baxter will make remodulin on different equipment and in a larger production batch than the current process  we are required to have the new equipment and process approved by the fda 
we are currently conducting the validation testing for the new equipment and process 
if the validation testing is successful  we anticipate filing for fda approval of the new equipment and process during baxter continues to manufacture remodulin for us according to the process currently approved by the fda 
in january  the fda approved hollister stier laboratories  llc as our second remodulin manufacturer  in the larger quantities described above 
we are actively working towards obtaining approval to manufacture remodulin and tyvaso in our silver spring facility 
our goal is to become the primary manufacturer with contracted third party manufacturers supplementing our manufacturing capacity 
also  although we maintain a three year inventory of remodulin and tyvaso based on expected demand  we believe that having third parties approved to manufacture these products will mitigate some of our manufacturing risks  including the risk that we might not be able to produce sufficient quantities to meet patient demand 
we rely on catalent pharma solutions  inc formerly cardinal health  inc catalent to do the following conduct stability studies on remodulin  manufacture tyvaso  serve as a backup manufacturer for oral treprostinil  and analyze other products we develop 
we have begun manufacturing oral treprostinil tablets  which are being used in our clinical trials  in our manufacturing facility in research triangle park  north carolina 
under our manufacturing and supply agreement with lilly  lilly manufactures and distributes adcirca through its wholesaler network in the same manner that it distributes its own pharmaceutical products 
under the terms of this agreement  we take title to adcirca upon completion of its manufacture by lilly 
adcirca is shipped to customers  generally pharmaceutical wholesalers  in accordance with purchase orders received by lilly 
although lilly provides these services on our behalf  we maintain the risk of loss as it pertains to inventory and non payment of invoices 

table of contents we manufacture the nebulizer used in our tyvaso inhalation system 
while we purchase the components and manage the manufacturing process  nebu tec supplies all the labor to manufacture the nebulizers 
in december  minnetronix  inc minnetronix was approved by the fda as a second manufacturer of the tyvaso inhalation system 
although we believe that other manufacturers and suppliers could provide similar products  services and materials  there are few companies that could replace these manufacturers and suppliers 
a change in supplier or manufacturer could cause a delay in the manufacture  distribution and research efforts associated with our respective products or result in increased costs

competition many drug companies engage in research and development to commercialize products to treat cardiovascular and infectious diseases and cancer 
for the treatment of pah  we compete with many approved products in the united states and the rest of the world  including the following flolan 
the first product approved by the fda for treating pah  flolan  also known as epoprostenol  is a prostacyclin that is delivered by intravenous infusion 
glaxo began marketing flolan in the united states in in  myogen  inc myogen acquired the marketing rights from glaxo for flolan in the united states 
in november  myogen was acquired by gilead sciences  inc gilead 
in  gilead returned the rights to flolan to glaxo 
the generic exclusivity period for flolan expired in april generic epoprostenol 
in april  teva announced that the fda approved its version of generic epoprostenol for the treatment of pah 
this is the first approved generic version of flolan 
in june  generamedix inc generamedix received fda approval for its version of epoprostenol  which is stable at room temperature 
in february  actelion announced that it had entered into an agreement with generamedix to acquire its epoprostenol product  marketed as veletri  and began commercial sales in the second half of  ventavis 
approved in december in the united states and in september in europe  ventavis is an inhaled prostacyclin analogue 
ventavis was initially marketed by cotherix  inc cotherix in the united states and is marketed by bayer schering pharma ag in europe as iloprost 
in january  cotherix was acquired by actelion  the manufacturer and distributor of tracleer and distributor of veletri  tracleer 
the first oral drug to be approved for pah  tracleer is also the first drug in its class  known as etras 
tracleer was approved in december in the united states and in may in europe 
tracleer is marketed worldwide by actelion  revatio 
approved in june in the united states  revatio is also an oral therapy and is marketed by pfizer 
revatio contains sildenafil  the same active ingredient as viagra  and is the first pde inhibitor to be approved for pah  letairis 
approved in june in the united states  letairis is an oral therapy marketed by gilead for the treatment of pah 
like tracleer  letairis is an etra 
in april  glaxo received marketing authorization from the ema for letairis in europe where it is known as volibris  and thelin 
approved in august in the eu  thelin is an oral therapy  which was developed and initially marketed in europe by encysive pharmaceuticals inc encysive  for the treatment of pah 
like tracleer and letairis  thelin is an etra 
in june  pfizer completed its acquisition of encysive 
during the fourth quarter of  pfizer discontinued selling thelin due to safety concerns 

table of contents due to their ease of use  oral therapies such as adcirca  revatio and tracleer are generally considered first line therapies for newly diagnosed nyha class ii pah patients  although remodulin is also approved for nyha class ii pah patients and patients may improve to nyha class ii status while on remodulin even if remodulin is started by patients in a more serious stage of the disease 
inhaled therapies like tyvaso and ventavis are generally used in nyha class iii patients during the middle stages of the pah disease treatment cycle  although remodulin is also approved for nyha class iii patients and is frequently used within this group 
more complex infusion therapies such as remodulin and flolan are often used as later stage therapies for nyha class iv patients  although many doctors start patients on these therapies prior to the advanced disease progression associated with nyha class iv 
the use of the available oral therapies and tyvaso  either alone or in combination  could delay the need for infusion therapy for many patients 
as a result  the success of other therapies in preventing disease progression affects our commercial products 
furthermore  the commercialization of generic forms of other approved pah therapies may exert downward pressure on the pricing of our products 
for further discussion on this risk  see item a risk factors we may not compete successfully with established and newly developed drugs or products  or the companies that develop and market them 
we compete with the developers  manufacturers and distributors all of these products for customers  funding  access to licenses  personnel  third party collaborators  product development and commercialization 
almost all of these companies have substantially greater financial  marketing  sales  distribution and technical resources  and more experience in research and development  product development and marketing  clinical trials and regulatory matters  than we have 
governmental regulation pharmaceutical product approval process the research  development  testing  manufacture  promotion  marketing  distribution  sampling  storage  recordkeeping  post approval monitoring and reporting  and import and export of pharmaceutical products drugs or biological products  hereinafter collectively drugs are extensively regulated by governmental agencies in the united states and in other countries 
failure to comply with applicable us requirements  pursuant to the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act  the public health service act  and other federal statutes and regulations  may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions  such as fda refusal to approve pending new drug applications ndas or biologics license applications blas  warning letters  product recalls  product seizures  total or partial suspension of production or distribution  injunctions  fines  civil penalties  and criminal prosecution 
satisfaction of fda pre market approval requirements typically takes many years  and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type  complexity and novelty of the product or disease 
drugs are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda in the united states  the ema in the eu and similar regulatory authorities in other countries 
the steps ordinarily required before a new drug may be marketed in the united states  which are similar to steps required in most other countries  include preclinical laboratory tests  preclinical studies in animals  formulation studies and the submission to the fda of an investigational new drug application ind for a new drug  clinical studies in healthy volunteers  clinical studies in patients to explore safety  efficacy and dose response characteristics  adequate and well controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for each indication  
table of contents the submission of an nda or bla to the fda  and fda review and approval of the nda or bla prior to any commercial sale or shipment of the drug 
preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation  as well as animal studies to explore toxicity and for proof of concept 
the conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including good laboratory practices 
in the united states  the results of preclinical testing are submitted to the fda as part of an ind  along with other information including information about product chemistry  manufacturing and controls and a proposed clinical trial protocol 
a day review period after the filing of each ind is generally required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans 
if the fda has not commented on or questioned the ind within this day period  the clinical trial proposed in the ind may begin 
at any time during this day period or at any time thereafter  the fda may halt proposed or ongoing clinical trials until it authorizes trials under specified terms 
the ind process may be extremely costly and may substantially delay development of our products 
moreover  positive results of preclinical tests will not necessarily indicate positive results in clinical trials 
clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug or biologic to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator 
clinical trials must be conducted in compliance with federal regulations  good clinical practices gcp and protocols detailing the objectives of the trial  the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated 
each protocol involving testing on us patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the fda as part of the ind 
the fda may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with fda requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients 
the study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board irb for approval 
an irb may also require the clinical trial at a site to be halted temporarily or permanently for failure to comply with the irb requirements  or may impose other conditions 
clinical trials in support of an nda or a bla are typically conducted in three sequential phases  but the phases may overlap 
during phase i  the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients  the drug is tested to assess its effects on bodily functions and safety  including side effects associated with increasing doses 
phase ii usually involves studies in a limited patient population to assess the efficacy of the drug in specific  targeted indications  assess tolerance and optimal dosage  and identify possible adverse effects and safety risks 
if a compound is found to be potentially effective and to have an acceptable safety profile in phase ii evaluations  then phase iii trials  also called pivotal studies  major studies or advanced clinical trials  are undertaken to further demonstrate clinical efficacy and to further test for safety within an expanded patient population at geographically diverse clinical study sites 
after successful completion of the required clinical testing  an nda or a bla is typically submitted to the fda in the united states  and an maa is typically submitted to the ema in the eu 
fda approval of the nda or bla is required before marketing of the product may begin in the us the nda or bla must include the results of all preclinical  clinical and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product pharmacology  chemistry  manufacture  and controls 
the cost of preparing and submitting an nda or bla is substantial 
under federal law  the submission of most ndas and blas is additionally subject to a substantial application fee  currently exceeding million  and the manufacturer and or sponsor of an approved new drug application are also subject to annual product and establishment manufacturing site fees  currently exceeding  per product 
table of contents and  per establishment 
these fees are typically increased annually 
however  the application  product  and establishment fees may be waived for orphan drugs if certain requirements are met 
the fda has days from its receipt of an nda or a bla to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review 
once the submission is accepted for filing  the fda begins an in depth review 
the fda has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of new drug applications 
most such applications for non priority drug products are reviewed within ten months while most applications for priority review drugs  that is  drugs that the fda determines represent a significant improvement over existing therapy  are reviewed in six months 
the review process may be extended by the fda for three additional months to consider certain information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission 
the fda may also refer applications for novel pharmaceutical products or pharmaceutical products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee  typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts  for review  evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved 
the fda is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee  but it generally follows such recommendations 
before approving an nda or a bla  the fda will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with gcp 
additionally  the fda will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured 
the fda will not approve the product unless compliance with current good manufacturing practices is satisfactory and the nda or bla contains data that provide substantial evidence that the pharmaceutical product is safe and effective for the indication studied 
in the united states  if fda evaluations of the application and the manufacturing facilities are favorable  the fda may issue either an approval letter or a complete response letter 
a complete response letter will usually contain a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the application and authorization of commercial marketing of the drug for certain indications 
if and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the fda satisfaction in a resubmission of the nda or bla  the fda will issue an approval letter 
the fda has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included 
an approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications 
to continue marketing our products after approval  applicable regulations require us to maintain a positive risk benefit profile  maintain regulatory applications through periodic reports to regulatory authorities  fulfill pharmacovigilance requirements  maintain manufacturing facilities according to the fda current good manufacturing practices requirements  and successfully complete regulatory agency inspections  among other requirements 
our manufacturing facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections 
as a condition of nda or bla approval  the fda may require substantial post approval testing and surveillance to monitor the product safety or efficacy and may impose other conditions  including labeling restrictions which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the pharmaceutical product 
once granted  product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing 
orphan drugs under the orphan drug act  an applicant can request the fda to designate a product as an orphan drug in the united states if the drug is intended to treat an orphan  or rare  disease or condition 
a disease or condition is considered orphan if it affects fewer than  people in the united states 
after the fda grants orphan drug designation  the generic identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the fda 
orphan drug designation does not shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process 
the first nda applicant to receive orphan drug designation and fda approval of the drug for the designated disease is entitled to a seven year exclusive marketing period in the us for that product for that indication 
during the seven year 
table of contents period  the fda may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease  except in limited circumstances  such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity 
orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the fda from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition  or the same drug for a different disease or condition 
among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the nda application user fee and product and establishment user fees 
the fda granted orphan designation for the active ingredient treprostinil for the treatment of pah as a continuous infusion 
however  this designation does not preclude us from seeking orphan drug designation for other formulations or routes of administration  such as oral or inhaled  of treprostinil to treat pah  or for treprostinil used to treat other orphan diseases 
in order for the fda to grant orphan drug designation for other formulations or routes of administration of treprostinil to treat pah  we must demonstrate that such new formulation or route of administration is clinically superior to the formulation or route of administration previously granted orphan designation 
pediatric information under the pediatric research equity act of prea  ndas  or blas and supplements to ndas or blas must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indication s in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each such pediatric subpopulation 
the fda may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers 
unless otherwise required by regulation  prea does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan drug designation has been granted 
the best pharmaceuticals for children act  or bpca  provides sponsors with an additional six month period of market exclusivity on all forms of the drug containing the active moiety  if the sponsor submits results of pediatric studies specifically requested by the fda under bpca 
in order to receive the bpca exclusivity  the drug must have other existing patent or exclusivity protection in effect 
hatch waxman act the hatch waxman act was enacted to encourage competition between brand and generic pharmaceutical companies 
it created a faster approval process for generic drugs  called the abbreviated new drug application anda  while it provided protection to brand pharmaceuticals by extending their patent protection 
upon approval of a drug through an nda  applicants are required to submit to the fda each patent that covers the applicant product or fda approved method of using this product 
those patents are then published in the fda approved drug products with therapeutic equivalence evaluations  commonly known as the orange book 
drugs listed in the orange book can  in turn  be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an anda 
generally  an anda provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strength s  route of administration  and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown through bioequivalence testing to be therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug 
anda applicants are not required to conduct or submit results of pre clinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product  other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing 
drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as generic equivalents to the listed drug  and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug 
the anda applicant is required to certify to the fda concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the fda orange book 
specifically  the applicant must certify that i the required patent information has not been filed  ii the listed patent has expired  iii the listed patent has not expired  but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration  or iv the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product 
a certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product listed patents or that such patents are invalid is called a paragraph iv certification 
if the applicant does not challenge the listed patents  the anda 
table of contents application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired 
alternatively  for a patent covering an approved method of use  an anda applicant may submit a statement to the fda that the company is not seeking approval for the covered use 
if the anda applicant has submitted a paragraph iv certification to the fda  the applicant must also send notice of the paragraph iv certification to the nda and patent holders once the anda has been accepted for filing by the fda 
the nda and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the paragraph iv certification 
the filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within days of the receipt of a paragraph iv certification automatically prevents the fda from approving the anda until the earlier of months  expiration of the patent  settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the anda applicant 
the anda application also will not be approved until any non patent exclusivity  such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity  listed in the orange book for the referenced product has expired 
federal law provides a period of five years following approval of a drug containing no previously approved active moiety  during which andas for generic versions of those drugs cannot be submitted unless the submission contains a paragraph iv challenge to a listed patent  in which case the submission may be made four years following the original product approval 
federal law provides for an exclusivity period of three years  during which the fda cannot grant effective approval of an anda  following approval of a listed drug that contains previously approved active ingredients but is approved in a new dosage form  route of administration or combination  or for a new condition of use that was required to be supported by new clinical trials conducted by or for the sponsor 
both of the five year and three year exclusivity periods  as well as any unexpired patents listed in the orange book for the listed drug  can be extended by six months if the fda grants the nda sponsor a period of pediatric exclusivity based on studies submitted by the sponsor in response to a written request 
the hatch waxman act provides that patent terms may be extended to compensate for some of the patent life that is lost during the fda regulatory review period for a product 
this extension period would generally be one half the time between the effective date of an ind and the submission date of an nda  plus all of the time between the submission date of an nda and its approval  subject to a maximum extension of five years 
similar patent term extensions are available under european laws 
following fda approval  we filed a patent term extension application with the united states patent and trademark office for our patent covering the method of treating pah using remodulin 
the application was approved in february with the maximum patent term extension of five years  and the patent will expire on october  section b new drug applications most drug products other than biological products obtain fda marketing approval pursuant to an nda or an anda 
a third alternative is a special type of nda  commonly referred to as a section b nda  which enables the applicant to rely  in part  on the fda finding of safety and efficacy data for an existing product  or published literature  in support of its application 
section b ndas often provide an alternate path to fda approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products 
section b permits the filing of an nda where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference 
the applicant may rely upon certain preclinical or clinical studies conducted for an approved product 
the fda may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product 
the fda may then approve the new product candidate for all or some of the labeled indications for which the referenced product has been approved  as well as for any new indication for which the section b nda applicant has submitted data 

table of contents to the extent that the section b applicant is relying on prior fda findings of safety and efficacy  the applicant is required to certify to the fda concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the orange book to the same extent that an anda applicant would 
thus  approval of a section b nda can be delayed until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired  until any non patent exclusivity  such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity  listed in the orange book for the referenced product has expired  and  in the case of a paragraph iv certification and subsequent patent infringement suit  until the earlier of months  settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the section b nda applicant 
other regulatory requirements once an nda or a bla is approved  a product will be subject to certain post approval requirements 
for instance  the fda closely regulates the post approval marketing and promotion of drugs  including standards and regulations for direct to consumer advertising  off label promotion  industry sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet 
pharmaceutical products may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling 
changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application  including changes in indications  labeling  or manufacturing processes or facilities  require submission and fda approval of a new or supplemental nda bla before the change can be implemented 
an nda bla supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application  and the fda uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing supplements as it does in reviewing ndas or blas 
adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports are required following fda approval of an nda or a bla 
the fda also may require post marketing testing  known as phase testing  risk minimization action plans  and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product 
in addition  quality control as well as drug manufacture  packaging  and labeling procedures must continue to conform to current good manufacturing practices cgmps after approval 
manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the fda and certain state agencies  and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the fda during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cgmps 
accordingly  manufacturers must continue to expend time  money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cgmps 
regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered 
marketing pharmaceutical products outside the united states outside of the united states  our ability to market our products is also contingent upon receiving marketing authorizations from regulatory authorities 
the foreign regulatory approval process may include some or all of the risks associated with fda approval set forth above 
the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials and marketing authorization vary widely from country to country 
at present  foreign marketing authorizations are applied for at a national level  although  within europe  procedures are available to companies wishing to market a product in more than one eu member state 
in the eu  marketing authorizations may be submitted through a centralized body or through a decentralized mutual recognition or a national level process 
the centralized procedure is mandatory for the approval of biotechnology products  high technology products and orphan products and is available at the applicant option for other products 
the centralized procedure provides for the grant 
table of contents of a single marketing authorization that is valid in all eu member countries 
the decentralized mutual recognition procedure is available for all medicinal products that are not subject to the centralized procedure 
the decentralized mutual recognition procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions  changes existing procedures for national approvals and establishes procedures for coordinated eu actions on products  suspensions and withdrawals 
under this procedure  the holder of a national marketing authorization for which mutual recognition is sought may submit an application to one or more eu member countries  certify that the dossier is identical to that on which the first approval was based  or explain any differences and certify that identical dossiers are being submitted to all eu member countries for which recognition is sought 
within days of receiving the application and assessment report  each eu member country must decide whether to recognize approval 
the procedure encourages member states to work with applicants and other regulatory authorities to resolve disputes concerning mutual recognition 
lack of objection of a given country within days automatically results in approval in that country 
following receipt of marketing authorization in an eu member country  the applicant is then usually depending on the country required to engage in pricing discussions and negotiations with a separate prescription pricing authority in that country 
commercial sales are only able to commence in a country once pricing approval has been received 
to secure european regulatory approvals for subcutaneous remodulin for pah  we used the mutual recognition process 
under the rules then applicable  centralized filing was not required and we perceived the decentralized mutual recognition procedure to be the most effective means for approval 
we filed our first maa in france in february review of our application was completed in as a result  remodulin was approved in member countries of the eu under the mutual recognition process described above 
we withdrew applications in spain  the united kingdom and ireland with the intent of resubmitting some or all of the applications when we achieve approval for intravenous remodulin since these countries required additional information not required by the other european countries 
to secure european regulatory approval for tyvaso  we submitted an maa to the ema via the centralized process in december regulations in europe have changed since we made our initial filing for remodulin and all therapies for orphan diseases must now use the centralized process 
in february  we withdrew our maa from consideration by the ema due to the ema major objection related to findings of non compliance with good clinical practice at two clinical sites 
the ema stated that these findings would preclude a recommendation for approval of tyvaso in the eu 
the ema had no major objections at the time of withdrawal related to the safety or efficacy of tyvaso 
us regulation of medical devices our medical devices are subject to regulation by government agencies  including the fda 
to varying degrees  each government agency requires us to comply with laws and regulations governing the developing  testing  manufacturing  labeling  marketing and distribution of our medical devices 
medical devices  unless expressly exempt by regulation  are required to be manufactured in conformance with the fda quality system regulations qsrs 
the qsrs are complex regulations that impose methods  procedures  and documentation requirements regarding the manufacturing and quality assurance activities of medical devices  including the design  testing  control  manufacturing  labeling  packaging  storage  and shipping of medical devices 
we are also subject to periodic inspections by regulatory agencies to ensure that we meet all regulatory requirements 
upon an inspection  if the fda were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations  or that any of our medical devices may pose unreasonable health risks  the fda could require us to notify health professionals or others of these risks  order a recall  repair  replacement or refund of such device  or detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices 
the fda may also impose operating restrictions  enjoin or restrain certain conduct resulting in violations of applicable law pertaining to medical devices and assess civil or criminal penalties 

table of contents to maintain approval of the tyvaso inhalation system in the united states  we must comply with the qsrs  and the fda may also require additional patient data to support approval for this device 
our telemedicine products are manufactured at contract facilities that must comply with the qsrs 
these devices are designed and sold by medicomp and have received marketing clearance from the fda under section k of the food  drug and cosmetic act 
government reimbursement of pharmaceutical products in the united states  many independent third party payers  as well as the medicare and state medicaid programs  reimburse buyers of our commercial products 
medicare is the federal program that provides health care benefits to senior citizens and certain disabled and chronically ill persons 
medicaid is the federal program administered by the states to provide health care benefits to certain indigent persons 
the medicare contractors who administer the program provide reimbursement for our pharmaceutical commercial products at a rate generally equal to of the published average wholesale price as of october  the medicare part b payment formula for drugs infused through durable medical equipment or of average sales price the medicare part b payment formula for drugs inhaled through durable medical equipment 
the state medicaid programs also generally provide reimbursement for our commercial products  at reimbursement rates that are below the published average wholesale price and that vary from state to state 
in return for including our pharmaceutical commercial products in the medicare and medicaid programs  we have agreed to pay a rebate to state medicaid agencies that provide reimbursement for those products 
we have also agreed to sell our commercial products under contracts with the department of veterans affairs  department of defense  public health service and numerous other federal agencies as well as certain hospitals that are designated as b covered entities entities designated by federal programs to receive drugs at discounted prices at prices that are significantly below the price we charge to our specialty pharmaceutical distributors 
these programs and contracts are highly regulated and impose restrictions on our business 
failure to comply with these regulations and restrictions could result in a loss of our ability to continue receiving reimbursement for our drugs 
we estimate that between of remodulin  tyvaso and adcirca sales in the united states are reimbursed under the medicare and medicaid programs 
anti kickback  false claims laws and the prescription drug marketing act in addition to fda restrictions on marketing pharmaceutical products  several other types of state and federal laws have been applied to restrict certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry in recent years 
these laws include anti kickback statutes and false claims statutes 
the federal healthcare program anti kickback statute prohibits  among other things  knowingly and willfully offering  paying  soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing  leasing  ordering or arranging for the purchase  lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under medicare  medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs 
this statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers  purchasers and formulary managers on the other 
violations of the anti kickback statute are punishable by imprisonment  criminal fines  civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs 
although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions  the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly  and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing  purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor 
federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting  or causing to be presented  a false claim for payment to the federal government  or knowingly making  or causing to be made  a false statement to have a false claim paid 
recently  several pharmaceutical and other 
table of contents healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services  which in turn were used by the government to set medicare and medicaid reimbursement rates  and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product 
in addition  certain marketing practices  including off label promotion  may also violate false claims laws 
the majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti kickback law and false claims laws  which apply to items and services reimbursed under medicaid and other state programs  or  in several states  apply regardless of the payor 
sanctions under these federal and state laws may include civil monetary penalties  exclusion of a manufacturer products from reimbursement under government programs  criminal fines  and imprisonment 
as part of the sales and marketing process  pharmaceutical companies frequently provide samples of approved drugs to physicians 
the prescription drug marketing act pdma  imposes requirements and limitations upon the provision of drug samples to physicians  and prohibits states from licensing distributors of prescription drugs unless the state licensing program meets certain federal guidelines that include minimum standards for storage  handling and record keeping 
in addition  the pdma sets forth civil and criminal penalties for violations 
patient protection and affordable care act of the patient protection and affordable care act of  as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act of ppaca is intended to expand healthcare coverage within the us several provisions of the new law  which have varying effective dates  may affect us and will likely increase certain of our costs 
for example  an increase in the medicaid rebate rate from percent to percent is effective as of january   and the volume of rebated drugs has been expanded to include beneficiaries in medicaid managed care organizations  effective as of march  the ppaca also imposes an annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers beginning in  based on the manufacturer sale of branded pharmaceuticals and biologics excluding orphan drugs to certain us government programs during the preceding year  expands the b drug discount program excluding orphan drugs including the creation of new penalties for non compliance  and includes a discount on brand name drugs for medicare part d participants in the coverage gap  or donut hole 
the law also revised the definition of average manufacturer price for reporting purposes effective october   which could increase the amount of the medicaid drug rebates paid to states 
the ppaca also created a regulatory pathway for the abbreviated approval of biological products that are demonstrated to be biosimilar or interchangeable with an fda approved biological product 
in order to meet the standard of interchangeability  a sponsor must demonstrate that the biosimilar product can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product  and for a product that is administered more than once  that the risk of switching between the reference product and biosimilar product is not greater than the risk of maintaining the patient on the reference product 
such biosimilars would reference biological products approved in the us the law establishes a period of years of data exclusivity for reference products  which protects the data in the original bla by prohibiting sponsors of biosimilars from gaining fda approval based in part on reference to data in the original bla 
in addition  the ppaca imposes new reporting requirements for pharmaceutical and device manufacturers with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals  effective march  in addition  pharmaceutical and device manufacturers will be required to report investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar year 
such information is to be made publicly available by the secretary of health and human services in a searchable format beginning september  failure to submit 
table of contents required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to  per year and up to million per year for knowing failures for all payments  transfers of value or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission 
further  the ppaca amends the intent requirement of the federal anti kickback and criminal health care fraud statutes 
a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it 
in addition  the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims laws 
state pharmaceutical and medical device marketing laws if not preempted by the ppaca  several states  such as maine  massachusetts  and vermont  require pharmaceutical companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products and to report gifts and payments to individual physicians in those states 
other states prohibit various other marketing related activities 
still other states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes 
in addition  certain states  such as california  nevada  and massachusetts  require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs or marketing codes and several other states are considering similar proposals 
compliance with these laws is difficult and time consuming  and companies that do not comply with these state laws face civil penalties

risk factors forward looking statements this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of section e of the securities exchange act of the exchange act and the private securities litigation reform act of which are based on our beliefs and expectations as to future outcomes 
these statements include  among others  statements relating to the following expectations of revenues  profitability  and cash flows  the sufficiency of current and future working capital for planned and unplanned needs including paying the holders of our senior convertible notes the principal due when the notes mature in october  the ability to obtain financing or raise capital in the future  the value of our common stock  the maintenance of domestic and international regulatory approvals  the timing and outcome of clinical studies and regulatory filings  including in particular our freedom c and freedom m trials and anticipated filing of an nda for oral treprostinil  the expected likelihood and timing of regulatory approvals for drug candidates under development and the timing of related sales  the outcome of potential future regulatory actions  including audits and inspections  from the fda and international regulatory agencies  the expected volume and timing of sales of remodulin treprostinil injection remodulin  adcirca tadalafil tablets adcirca and tyvaso treprostinil inhalation solution tyvaso collectively  referred to as our commercial products  the impact of competing therapies  including generic products  on sales of our commercial products  the expectation that we will be able to manufacture sufficient quantities and maintain adequate inventories of our commercial products  the adequacy of our intellectual property protections and expiration dates on our patents and licensed patents and products  the potential impact  if any  of the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of on our business  the outcome of any litigation or arbitration proceedings in which we are or may become involved  any statements preceded by  followed by or that include any form of the words believe  seek  expect  anticipate  forecast  project  intend  estimate  should  could  may  will  plan  or similar expressions  and other statements contained or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k that are not historical facts 
the statements identified as forward looking statements may exist in item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations or elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially from anticipated results 
factors that may cause such differences include  but are 
table of contents not limited to  those discussed below 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
risks related to our business we have a history of losses and may not maintain profitability 
we have experienced financial reporting periods in which we incurred net losses 
while we believe we develop our annual cash based operating budgets using reasonable assumptions and targets  unanticipated factors  including factors outside of our control  could affect our profitability and cause uneven quarterly and or annual operating results 
we rely heavily on sales of remodulin and tyvaso to produce revenues 
during the twelve months ended december   net remodulin and tyvaso sales accounted for percent and percent of our total revenues  respectively 
a wide variety of events  many of which are described in other risk factors below  could cause sales of remodulin and or tyvaso to decline 
for instance  if regulatory approvals for either of these products were withdrawn  we would be unable to sell the product and our business could be jeopardized 
any substantial change in the prescribing practices or dosing patterns of patients using remodulin or tyvaso due to combination therapy  side effects  adverse events  death or any other reasons  could decrease related revenues 
in addition  we rely on third parties to produce  market  distribute and sell remodulin and tyvaso 
the inability of any one of these third parties to perform these functions  or the failure of these parties to perform successfully  could negatively affect our revenues 
we are also increasingly internalizing elements of the manufacturing process  and any failure to manage our internal manufacturing processes could result in a decrease in production and an inability to meet demand 
because we are highly dependent on sales of remodulin and tyvaso  any reduction in sales of either or both of these products would have a negative and possibly material adverse impact on our operations 
if our products fail in clinical trials  we will be unable to obtain or maintain fda and international regulatory approvals and will be unable to sell those products 
to obtain regulatory approvals from the fda and international regulatory agencies such as the ema  we must conduct clinical trials demonstrating that our products are safe and effective 
in the past  several of our product candidates failed or were discontinued at various stages in the development process 
in addition  we may need to amend ongoing trials or the fda and or international regulatory agencies may require us to perform additional trials beyond those we planned 
such occurrences could result in significant delays and additional costs  and related clinical trials may be unsuccessful 
in november  we reported that our freedom c phase iii clinical trial of oral treprostinil did not achieve statistical significance for its primary endpoint 
because we have decided to amend the protocol for our current freedom m phase iii clinical trial and conduct a new phase iii clinical trial  freedom c  we have experienced delays in completing our clinical trials for oral treprostinil and do not anticipate filing an nda prior to as with all clinical trials  there is a risk that freedom m and freedom c may not be successful 
upon filing an nda  we could be subject to additional delays  if the fda determines that it cannot approve the nda as submitted 
in such case  the fda would issue a complete response letter  which would outline the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the fda to reconsider the application 
if and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the fda satisfaction in a resubmission of the nda  the fda would then issue an approval letter 
we may fail to address any such deficiencies adequately  in which case we would be unable to obtain fda approval to market a given product candidate 

table of contents the length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for marketing varies by product  product use and country 
furthermore  we cannot predict with certainty the length of time it will take to complete necessary clinical trials or obtain regulatory approval of our future products 
our clinical trials may be discontinued  delayed or disqualified for various reasons 
these reasons include the drug is ineffective  or physicians believe that the drug is ineffective  patients do not enroll in our studies at the rate we expect  ongoing or new clinical trials conducted by drug companies in addition to our own clinical trials reduce the number of patients available for our trials  patients experience severe side effects during treatment  other investigational or approved therapies are viewed as more effective or convenient by physicians or patients  our clinical trial sites or our contracted clinical trial administrators may not adhere to trial protocols and required quality controls  particularly as clinical trials expand into new territories  our trials do not comply with applicable regulations or guidelines  we do not pass inspections by regulatory agencies  patients die during our trials because of an adverse event related to the trial drug  their disease is too advanced  or they experience medical problems unrelated to the drug being studied  drug supplies are unavailable or unsuitable for use in our studies  and the results of preclinical testing cause delays in our trials 
in addition  the fda and its international equivalents have substantial discretion over the approval process for pharmaceutical products 
as such  these regulatory agencies may not agree that we have demonstrated the requisite level of product safety and efficacy to grant approval 
we may not compete successfully with established and newly developed drugs or products  or the companies that develop and market them 
we compete with well established drug companies for  among other things  funding  licenses  expertise  personnel  clinical trial patients and investigators  consultants and third party collaborators 
we also compete with these companies for market share 
most of these competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing  manufacturing  sales  distribution and technical resources than we do 
these competitors also have more experience in areas such as research and development  clinical trials  sales and marketing and regulatory matters than we do 
there are several treatments that compete with our commercial therapies 
for the treatment of pah  we compete with a number of approved products in the united states and worldwide  including the following flolan  ventavis  tracleer  revatio  letairis  veletri and a generic intravenously administered product containing epoprostenol  the active ingredient in flolan 
patients and doctors may perceive these competing products as safer  more effective  more convenient and or less expensive than our therapies 
alternatively  doctors may reduce the prescribed doses of our products if they prescribe them as combination therapy with our competitors products 
in addition  certain competing products are less invasive than remodulin and the use of these products may delay or prevent initiation of remodulin therapy 
any of these circumstances may suppress our sales growth  or cause our revenues to decline 

table of contents actelion  gilead and pfizer presently control the majority of the approved therapies for pah in the united states 
each of these companies has achieved considerable influence over prescribers through the sales and marketing of their respective therapies and through market dominance in this therapeutic area 
furthermore  the future commercialization and introduction of new pah therapies into the market could exert downward pressure on the pricing of our products and reduce our market share 
discoveries or development of new products or technologies by others may make our products obsolete or seemingly inferior 
other companies may discover or introduce new products that render all or some of our technologies and products obsolete or noncompetitive 
our commercial therapies may have to compete with numerous investigational products currently in development 
in addition  alternative approaches to treating chronic diseases  such as gene therapy  may make our products obsolete or noncompetitive 
other investigational therapies for pah could be used in combination with  or as a substitute for  our therapies 
if this occurs  doctors may reduce or discontinue the use of our pharmaceutical products for their patients 
sales of our products are subject to reimbursement from government agencies and other third parties 
pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement pressures may cause our sales to suffer 
the commercial success of our products and services depends  in part  on the availability of reimbursements by governmental payers such as medicare and medicaid  and private insurance companies 
accordingly  our commercial success is tied to such third party payers 
in the united states  the european union and other significant or potentially significant markets for our products  third party payers are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medicinal products and services  and are frequently challenging the pricing of new and expensive drugs 
consequently  it may be difficult for our specialty pharmaceutical distributors or wholesalers to obtain reimbursement of our products from third party payers 
alternatively  third party payers may reduce the amount of reimbursement for our products based on changes in pricing of other therapies for pah  including generic formulations of other approved therapies 
if third party payers do not approve our products for reimbursement  or limit reimbursements  patients could choose a competing product that is approved for reimbursement 
presently  most third party payers  including medicare and medicaid  reimburse the cost of our commercial products 
our prostacyclin analogue products  remodulin and tyvaso  are expensive therapies 
the medicare modernization act mma requires that we negotiate a new price for our commercial products with the centers for medicare and medicaid services 
as a result of the staggered implementation of the mma  our products have not yet been subject to its pricing provisions  however  future reimbursements could be subject to reduction 
furthermore  to the extent that private insurers or managed care programs follow any reduced medicaid and medicare coverage and payment developments  the negative impact on our business would be compounded 
we are currently assessing the potential effect of the patient protection and affordable care act and the related health care and education reconciliation act of on our business 
while we believe the short term impact on our business of this legislation will not be material  we continue to monitor the developments of this legislation as many of its provisions are not yet effective and are subject to finalization 
in europe  the success of our commercial products and future products depends largely on obtaining and maintaining government reimbursement 
in many european countries patients are unlikely to use prescription drugs that are not reimbursed by their governments 
reimbursement policies may adversely affect our ability to sell our products on a profitable basis 
in many markets outside the united states  governments control the prices of prescription pharmaceuticals  including through the implementation of reference pricing  price cuts  rebates  revenue related taxes and profit 
table of contents control  and expect prices of prescription pharmaceuticals to decline over the life of the product or as volumes increase 
our manufacturing strategy exposes us to significant risks 
we must be able to produce sufficient quantities of our commercial products to satisfy demand 
the process of manufacturing our products is difficult and complex  and currently involves a number of third parties 
we produce treprostinil  the active ingredient in both remodulin and tyvaso  in our silver spring  maryland facility using raw materials and advanced intermediate compounds supplied by vendors 
although we produce treprostinil  we outsource the manufacture of remodulin to baxter and hollister stier 
we also rely on catalent to manufacture tyvaso 
we are in the process of developing the capability to manufacture remodulin and tyvaso at our own facilities 
currently  we manufacture oral treprostinil tablets for use in our clinical trials  but neither we nor our third party vendors would be able to manufacture oral treprostinil on a commercial scale in the us without fda approval of a new drug application nda for oral treprostinil or for international commercial sales without the corresponding international approvals 
as long as we utilize third party vendors for significant portions of our manufacturing process  we will remain exposed to the risks described under the risk factor below titled we rely in part on third parties to perform activities that are critical to our business 
our ability to generate commercial sales or conduct clinical trials could suffer if our third party suppliers and service providers fail to perform 
in addition  while we expect our efforts to internalize additional manufacturing processes will increase our control over manufacturing  it will also subject us to risks as we engage in complex manufacturing processes for the first time 
for example  remodulin and tyvaso must be produced in a sterile environment  and we have no experience with sterile manufacturing on a commercial scale 
some of the products we are developing will involve even more complicated manufacturing processes than our current products 
for example  the monoclonal antibodies we are developing are biologic products  which are inherently more difficult to manufacture than our current products and involve increased risk of viral and other contaminations 
additional risks presented by our manufacturing strategy include we and our third party manufacturers are subject to the fda current good manufacturing practices in the united states and similar regulatory standards internationally 
while we have significant control over regulatory compliance with respect to our internal manufacturing processes  we do not exercise the same level of control over regulatory compliance by our third party manufacturers  as we expand our manufacturing operations to include new elements of the manufacturing process or new products  we will need to design and implement processes and procedures to ensure compliance with applicable regulations  even if we and our third party manufacturers are in compliance with domestic and international drug manufacturing regulations  the sterility and quality of the products being manufactured could be substandard and  therefore  such products would be unavailable for sale or use  if we have to replace a third party manufacturer with another manufacturer or our own manufacturing operations  the fda and its international counterparts would require new testing and compliance inspections 
furthermore  a new manufacturer would have to be familiarized with the processes necessary to manufacture and commercially validate our products  as manufacturing our treprostinil based products is complex 
any new third party manufacturers and any new manufacturing process at our own facilities would need to be approved by the fda and its international counterparts before being used to produce commercial supply of our products  
table of contents we may be unable to contract with needed manufacturers on satisfactory terms or at all  and the supply of materials and components necessary to manufacture and package our products may become scarce or interrupted 
disruptions to the supply of these materials could delay the manufacture and subsequent sale of such products 
any products manufactured with substituted materials or components would be subject to approval from the fda and international regulatory agencies before they could be sold 
the timing of any such regulatory approval is difficult to predict 
any of these factors could disrupt sales of our commercial products  delay clinical trials or commercialization of new products  result in product liability claims and product recalls  and entail higher costs 
we rely in part on third parties to perform activities that are critical to our business 
our ability to generate commercial sales or conduct clinical trials could suffer if our third party suppliers and service providers fail to perform 
frequently  we involve third parties to assist us in conducting clinical trials  obtaining regulatory approvals  and marketing and distributing our products  as we do not possess the internal capacity to perform all of these functions 
accordingly  the success of these third parties in performing their contractual obligations is critical to our operations 
we manufacture treprostinil with raw materials and advanced intermediate compounds supplied by vendors 
the inability of our vendors to supply these raw materials and advanced intermediate compounds in the quantities we require could delay the manufacture of treprostinil for commercial use and for use in our clinical trials 
we rely on baxter to manufacture remodulin for us  and the fda recently approved hollister stier as a second manufacturer of remodulin 
we extended our contract with baxter through and as part of that contract amendment  we agreed that baxter will manufacture remodulin in greater quantities using larger production equipment than under its current manufacturing process 
this new manufacturing process and related equipment will require fda and international approvals 
catalent manufactures tyvaso for commercial use and also maintains the ability to manufacture oral treprostinil for us 
in addition  catalent conducts stability studies on remodulin and tyvaso for us and analyzes other products that we are developing 
we are also evaluating alternative supply arrangements  including other third party production arrangements and the production of remodulin and tyvaso in our combination office and laboratory facility in silver spring  maryland 
if we are unable to successfully implement these alternatives  we may not have sufficient inventory to meet future demand 
presently  we are producing oral treprostinil for clinical trials at our manufacturing facility in research triangle park  north carolina 
however  our process to manufacture oral treprostinil has not been approved for commercial use by the fda or international regulatory agencies  and we may encounter unforeseen obstacles in seeking regulatory approval 
nebu tec retains many responsibilities related to the manufacture of the tyvaso inhalation system  which includes a nebulizer and related accessories 
although we manage the manufacturing process  nebu tec supplies the labor 
we rely on nebu tec  as we do for any third party contractor  to adhere to and maintain the manufacturing process in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements 
any regulatory compliance problems encountered by nebu tec related to the manufacture of the tyvaso inhalation system could adversely affect the sale of tyvaso 
until the fourth quarter of  when we received approval for minnetronix to serve as a second manufacturer of the tyvaso inhalation system  the nebu tec facility was the only facility currently approved for the manufacturing of the tyvaso inhalation system 
if we are unable to manufacture or supply the tyvaso inhalation system in the quantities we require or if our suppliers are unable to supply sufficient parts 
table of contents to manufacture the tyvaso inhalation system  it could delay  disrupt or prevent us from selling tyvaso  which could impede our business and its projected growth 
we rely on accredo  curascript  and caremark to market  distribute and sell remodulin and tyvaso in the united states 
these distributors are also partially responsible for negotiating reimbursements from third party payers for the cost of our therapies 
in march and april of  we increased the price on all concentrations of remodulin sold to our us based and international distributors by percent and percent  respectively 
in addition  we increased the price of tyvaso by percent in november our price increases may not be fully reimbursed by third party payers 
if our distributors do not achieve acceptable profit margins on our products  they may reduce or discontinue the sale of our products 
furthermore  if our domestic and international distributors devote fewer resources to selling our products or are unsuccessful in their sales efforts  our revenues may decline materially 
we rely on lilly to manufacture and supply adcirca for us  and we use lilly pharmaceutical wholesaler network to distribute adcirca in the united states and puerto rico 
if lilly is unable to manufacture or supply adcirca or its distribution network is disrupted  it could delay  disrupt or prevent us from selling adcirca  which could slow down the growth of our business 
although most of our current suppliers and service providers could eventually be replaced  a change in suppliers and or service providers could interrupt the manufacture and distribution of our commercial products and our other products and services  and impede the progress of our clinical trials  commercial launch plans and related revenues 
interruptions in manufacturing could be significant given the length of time and complexity involved in obtaining necessary fda and other regulatory approvals for alternative arrangements  through either third parties or internal manufacturing processes 
our operations must comply with extensive laws and regulations in the us and other countries  including fda regulations 
failure to obtain approvals on a timely basis or to achieve continued compliance could delay  disrupt or prevent the commercialization of our products 
the products we develop must be approved for marketing and sale by regulatory agencies and  once approved  are subject to extensive regulation 
the process of obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals for new drugs is lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
the manufacture  distribution  advertising and marketing of these products are also subject to extensive regulation 
any future product approvals we receive could be accompanied by significant restrictions on the use or marketing of the product 
product candidates may fail to receive marketing approval on a timely basis  or at all 
if granted  product approvals can be withdrawn for failure to comply with regulatory requirements  such as the fda post marketing requirement and post marketing commitments for tyvaso or upon the occurrence of adverse events subsequent to commercial introduction 
discovery of previously unknown problems with our marketed products or problems with our manufacturing  regulatory  compliance  marketing or sales activities could result in regulatory restrictions on our products  including withdrawal of our products from the market 
for example  in february  we withdrew our maa for tyvaso as a result of findings by the ema that certain of our clinical sites had failed to comply with good clinical practices 
if we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements  we could be subject to penalties that may consist of fines  suspension of regulatory approvals  product recalls  seizure of our products and or criminal prosecution 
in addition  our reputation could be harmed as a result of any such regulatory restrictions or actions and patients and physicians may not want to use our products even after we have resolved these issues that led to such regulatory action 

table of contents we are subject to ongoing regulatory review of our currently marketed products 
after any of our products receive regulatory approval  they remain subject to ongoing regulation  which can impact  among other things  product labeling  manufacturing practices  adverse event reporting  storage  distribution  advertising and promotion  and record keeping 
if we do not comply with the applicable regulations  the range of possible sanctions includes issuance of adverse publicity  product recalls or seizures  fines  total or partial suspensions of production and or distribution  suspension of marketing applications  and enforcement actions  including injunctions and civil or criminal prosecution 
the fda and comparable international regulatory agencies can withdraw a product approval under some circumstances  such as the failure to comply with regulatory requirements or unexpected safety issues 
further  the fda often requires post marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the effects of approved products 
the fda and comparable international regulatory agencies may condition approval of our product candidates on the completion of such post marketing clinical studies 
these post marketing studies may suggest that a product causes undesirable side effects or may present a risk to the patient 
if data we collect from post marketing studies suggest that one of our approved products may present a risk to safety  the government authorities could withdraw our product approval  suspend production or place other marketing restrictions on our products 
if regulatory sanctions are applied or if regulatory approval is delayed or withdrawn  our operating results and the value of our company may be adversely affected 
additionally  if we are unable to generate revenue from the sale of these products  our potential for generating positive cash flow will be diminished and the need for capital necessary to fund our operations will be increased 
regulatory approval for our currently marketed products is limited by the fda to those specific indications and conditions for which clinical safety and efficacy have been demonstrated 
any regulatory approval of our products is limited to those specific diseases and indications for which our products are deemed to be safe and effective by the fda 
in addition to the fda approval required for new formulations  any new indication for an approved product also requires fda approval 
if we are not able to obtain fda approval for any desired future indications for our products  our ability to effectively market and sell our products may be reduced and our business may be adversely affected 
while physicians may choose to prescribe drugs for uses that are not described in the product labeling and for uses that differ from those approved by regulatory authorities called off label uses  our ability to promote the products is limited to those indications that are specifically approved by the fda 
although us regulatory authorities generally do not regulate the behavior of physicians  they do restrict communications by companies on the subject of off label use 
if our promotional activities fail to comply with these regulations or guidelines  we may be subject to warnings from  or enforcement action by  these authorities 
in addition  our failure to follow fda rules and guidelines relating to promotion and advertising may cause the fda to delay or refuse approval for a product  the suspension or withdrawal of an approved product from the market  recalls  fines  disgorgement of money  operating restrictions  injunctions or criminal prosecution  any of which could harm our business 
we must comply with various laws around the world that restrict certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical and medical device industries 
failure to comply with such laws could result in penalties and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
various laws around the world  including antikickback and false claims statutes  the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and the uk bribery act  restrict particular marketing practices in the pharmaceutical and medical device industries 
although we have compliance programs and procedures 
table of contents in place that we believe are effective  our business activities may be subject to challenge under these laws  and any penalties imposed upon us could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  we have significantly expanded our sales and marketing staff recently 
although we train our sales and marketing staff under our corporate compliance programs  any expansion of sales and marketing efforts can have the effect of increasing the risk of noncompliance with these laws 
in the united states  the federal health care program antikickback statute prohibits  among other things  knowingly and willfully offering  paying  soliciting  or receiving remuneration to induce  or in return for  purchasing  leasing  ordering  or arranging for the purchase  lease  or order of any health care item or service reimbursable under medicare  medicaid  or other federally financed healthcare programs 
this statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers and prescribers  purchasers  and formulary managers 
although a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors exist to protect certain common activities from prosecution  the exemptions and safe harbors are narrow  and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescriptions  purchases  or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor 
although we seek to comply with the conditions for reliance on these exemptions and safe harbors  our practices may not always meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from anti kickback liability 
federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting  or causing to be presented  a false claim for payment to the federal government  or knowingly making  or causing to be made  a false statement to get a false claim paid 
several pharmaceutical and health care companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product 
other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the company marketing of the product for unapproved  and thus non reimbursable  uses 
the majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti kickback law and false claims laws  which apply to items and services reimbursed under medicaid and other state programs  or  in several states  apply regardless of the payer 
sanctions under these federal and state laws may include civil monetary penalties  exclusion of a manufacturer products from reimbursement under government programs  criminal fines  and imprisonment 
the ppaca imposes new reporting requirements for pharmaceutical and device manufacturers with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals  effective march  in addition  pharmaceutical and device manufacturers will be required to report and disclose investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar year 
such information is to be made publicly available by the secretary of health and human services in a searchable format beginning september  failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to  per year and up to million per year for knowing failures for all payments  transfers of value or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission 
further  the ppaca amends the intent requirement of the federal anti kickback and criminal health care fraud statutes 
a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it 
in addition  the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims laws 
if not preempted by this federal law  several states require pharmaceutical companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products and to report gifts and payments to individual physicians in those states 
other states prohibit various other marketing related activities 
still other states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their 
table of contents outcomes 
in addition  certain states  such as california  nevada  and massachusetts  require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs or marketing codes and several other states are considering similar proposals 
compliance with these laws is difficult and time consuming  and companies that do not comply with these state laws face civil penalties 
government health care reform could increase our costs  which would adversely affect our revenue and results of operations 
our industry is highly regulated and changes in law may adversely impact our business  operations or financial results 
the ppaca is a sweeping measure intended to expand healthcare coverage within the united states  primarily through the imposition of health insurance mandates on employers and individuals and expansion of the medicaid program 
the reforms imposed by the new law will significantly impact the pharmaceutical industry  however  the full effects of the ppaca cannot be known until these provisions are implemented and the centers for medicare medicaid services and other federal and state agencies issue applicable regulations or guidance 
moreover  in the coming years  additional changes could be made to governmental healthcare programs that could significantly impact the success of our products or product candidates 
we will continue to evaluate the ppaca  as amended  the implementation of regulations or guidance related to various provisions of the ppaca by federal agencies  as well as trends and changes that may be encouraged by the legislation and that may potentially have an impact on our business over time 
reports of actual or perceived side effects and adverse events associated with our products  such as sepsis  could cause physicians and patients to avoid or discontinue use of our products in favor of alternative treatments 
reports of side effects and adverse events associated with our products could have a significant adverse impact on the sale of our products 
an example of a known risk associated with intravenous remodulin is sepsis  which is a serious and potentially life threatening infection of the bloodstream caused by a wide variety of bacteria 
intravenous prostacyclins  such as intravenous remodulin and flolan  are infused continuously through a catheter placed in a large vein in the patient chest  and sepsis is a known risk associated with this type of delivery 
as a result  sepsis is included as a risk in both the remodulin and flolan package inserts 
although a discussion of the risk of sepsis is currently included on the remodulin label  and the occurrence of sepsis is familiar to physicians who prescribe intravenously administered therapies  concerns about bloodstream infections may adversely affect a physician prescribing practice of remodulin 
our corporate compliance program cannot guarantee that we comply with all potentially applicable federal  state and international regulations 
the development  manufacture  distribution  pricing  sales  marketing  and reimbursement of our products  together with our general operations  are subject to extensive federal  state  local and international regulations  which are constantly evolving 
these regulations are subject to frequent revisions that often introduce more stringent requirements 
while we believe we have developed and instituted adequate corporate compliance programs  we cannot ensure that we will always be in compliance with these regulations 
if we fail to comply with any of these regulations  we could be subject to a range of penalties including  but not limited to the termination of clinical trials  the failure to receive approval of a product candidate  restrictions on our products or manufacturing processes  withdrawal of our products from the market  significant fines  exclusion from government healthcare programs  and other sanctions or litigation 

table of contents if the licenses  assignments and alliance agreements we depend on are breached or terminated  we could lose our right to develop and sell products covered by such agreements 
our business depends upon the acquisition  assignment and license of drugs and other products that have been discovered and initially developed by others 
under our product license agreements  we receive certain rights to existing intellectual property owned by others subject to the terms of each license agreement 
under agreements assigning intellectual property rights to us  the assignor transfers all right  title and interest in and to the intellectual property to us  which are subject to the terms of such agreements 
in addition  we may be required to obtain licenses to other third party technologies to commercialize our early stage products 
this dependence on technology developed by others involves the following risks we may be unable to obtain future licenses or assignment agreements at a reasonable cost or at all  if any of our licenses or assignment agreements are terminated  we will lose our rights to develop and market related products  our license and assignment agreements generally provide the licensor or assignor the right to terminate these arrangements in the event we breach such agreements eg  if we fail to pay royalties and other fees timely  and if a licensor or assignor fails to maintain the intellectual property licensed or assigned to us as required by most of our license and assignment agreements  we may lose our rights to develop and market some or all of our products 
in addition  we may be forced to incur substantial costs to maintain the intellectual property ourselves or force the licensor or assignor to do so 
certain license and assignment agreements may restrict our ability to develop related products in certain countries or for particular diseases and may impose other restrictions on our freedom to develop and market our products 
when we license or are assigned rights to drugs and other products that have been discovered and initially developed by others  our rights are frequently limited 
for instance  our rights to market adcirca are geographically limited to the united states and puerto rico  however  we would have an opportunity to negotiate with lilly for the rights to market adcirca in other territories in the event that lilly decides not to market adcirca in a particular territory 
furthermore  we cannot undertake any additional investigational work with respect to adcirca in other indications of pulmonary hypertension without lilly prior approval 
lilly also has authority over all regulatory activities and has the right to determine the retail price for adcirca and the wholesale price at which lilly sells adcirca to us 
provisions in our license and assignment agreements may impose other restrictions that affect our ability to develop and market related products 
for example  glaxo retained an exclusive option and right of first refusal to negotiate a license agreement with us if we decide to license any aspect of the commercialization of remodulin and tyvaso anywhere in the world 
similarly  our amended license agreement with toray includes a conditional non compete clause that grants toray the right to be our exclusive provider of beraprost mr 
moreover  we must also meet certain minimum annual sales to maintain our exclusive rights to beraprost mr 
if our or our suppliers patents or other intellectual property protections are inadequate  our revenues and profits could suffer or our competitors could force our products out of the market 
the period under which our commercial and developmental therapies are protected by our patent rights is limited 
our us patent for the method of treating pah with remodulin will expire in october our three us patents covering our current methods of synthesizing and producing treprostinil  the active ingredient in both remodulin and tyvaso  expire in october we also have 
table of contents been granted one patent in the eu and one patent in japan  each of which covers our treprostinil synthesis and production methods and will expire in october the patent for adcirca for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension will expire in and our patents for tyvaso will expire in the united states and in various countries throughout the eu in and  respectively 
we continue to conduct research into new methods to synthesize treprostinil and have two registered patents in the united states that expire in  as well as  additional us and international pending patent applications  relating to such methods 
however  we cannot be sure that these additional patents will successfully deter competitors  or that additional patent applications will result in grants of patents 
upon the expiration of our patents  competitors may develop generic versions of our products and market those generic versions to compete with our products 
competitors may also seek to design around our patents prior to their expiration to develop competing products 
the scope of any patent may be insufficient to deter competitors and patent laws of international jurisdictions may not protect our rights to the same extent as the patent laws of the united states 
furthermore  our suppliers intellectual property protections may not be adequate 
consequently  competitors may attempt to invalidate our existing patents before they expire 
in addition to patent protection  we also rely on trade secrets  proprietary know how and technological advances 
we enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and others  but these agreements may be ineffective in protecting our proprietary information 
to the extent third party patents cover our products or services  we  or our strategic collaborators  would be required to seek licenses from the holders of these patents in order to manufacture  use  or sell our products and services 
payments under these licenses would reduce our profits from the sale of related products and services 
moreover  we may be unable to obtain these licenses on acceptable terms or at all 
if we fail to obtain a required license or are unable to alter the design of our technology to avoid infringing a third party patent  we would be unable to market related products and services 
we may initiate litigation to enforce or defend our patents or proprietary rights  however  litigation can be time consuming and costly and may not conclude favorably 
if we are unsuccessful with respect to any future legal action in the defense of our patents and our patents are invalidated or canceled  our business could be negatively impacted 
furthermore  any licensed rights  patents or other intellectual property we possess may be challenged  invalidated  canceled  infringed or circumvented and  therefore  may not provide us with any competitive advantage 
we may not maintain adequate insurance coverage to protect us against significant product liability claims 
the testing  manufacturing  marketing  and sale of drugs and diagnostics involve product liability risks 
although we currently maintain product liability insurance  we may not be able to maintain this insurance at an acceptable cost  if at all 
in addition  our insurance coverage may not be adequate for all potential claims 
if claims or losses significantly exceed our liability insurance coverage  we may be forced out of business 
improper handling of hazardous materials used in our activities could expose us to significant liabilities 
our research and development and manufacturing activities involve the controlled use of chemicals and hazardous substances and we are expanding these activities in both scale and location 
in addition  patients may dispose of our products using means we do not control 
such activities subject us to numerous federal  state  and local environmental and safety laws and regulations that govern the management  storage and disposal of hazardous materials 
compliance with current or future environmental laws and regulations can require significant costs  furthermore  we can be subject to substantial fines and penalties in the event of noncompliance 
while we believe we comply with laws 
table of contents and regulations governing these materials  the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated 
furthermore  once chemical and hazardous materials leave our facilities  we cannot control what our hazardous waste removal contractors choose to do with these materials 
in the event of an accident  we could be liable for substantial civil damages or costs associated with the cleanup of the release of hazardous materials 
any related liability could exceed our resources and could have a materially adverse effect on our business 
we may encounter substantial difficulties managing our growth relative to product demand 
we have spent considerable resources building our laboratories and manufacturing facilities  and we are currently seeking regulatory approvals for some of these laboratories and all of our manufacturing facilities 
these facilities may be insufficient to meet future demand for our products 
alternatively  we may have excess capacity at these facilities if future demand falls short of our expectations  or if we do not receive regulatory approvals for the products we intend to produce at these facilities 
constructing our facilities was expensive and our ability to recover our investment satisfactorily will depend on sales of the products manufactured at these facilities in sufficient volume 
if we do experience substantial sales growth  we may have difficulty managing inventory levels as marketing new therapies is complicated  and gauging future demand can be difficult and uncertain 
we intend to increase our internal manufacturing activities and reduce reliance on third party suppliers  but we may not be successful in doing so 
as our manufacturing capabilities and sales forces grow  we will be faced with increasing regulatory risks and will need to develop appropriate processes and compliance programs to manage such risks 
if we need additional financing and cannot obtain it  our product development and sales efforts may be limited 
we may be required to seek additional sources of financing to meet unplanned or planned expenditures 
unplanned expenditures could be significant and may result from necessary modifications to product development plans or product offerings in response to difficulties encountered with clinical trials 
we may also face unexpected costs in preparing products for commercial sale  or in maintaining sales levels of our currently marketed therapeutic products 
if we are unable to obtain additional funding on commercially reasonable terms or at all  we may be compelled to delay clinical studies  curtail operations or obtain funds through collaborative arrangements that may require us to relinquish rights to certain products or potential markets 
we may require additional financing to meet significant future obligations 
for example  upon the maturity of our convertible senior notes in october  we must repay our investors in cash up to the principal balance of approximately million 
in addition  awards granted under our share tracking awards plan stap entitle participants to receive in cash an amount equal to the appreciation in the price of our common stock  which is calculated as the positive difference between the closing price of our common stock on the date of exercise and the date of grant 
consequently  the stap will likely require significant future cash payments to participants to the extent the price of our common stock continues to appreciate and the number of vested stap awards increases over time 
if we do not have sufficient funds to meet such contractual obligations or the ability to secure alternative sources of financing  we could be in default  face litigation and or lose key employees 

table of contents risks related to our common stock the price of our common stock can be highly volatile and may decline 
the price of common stock can be highly volatile within the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sector 
consequently  there can be significant price and volume fluctuations in the market that may not always relate to operating performance 
the table below sets forth the high and low closing prices for our common stock for the periods indicated high low january  december  january  december  january  december  the price of our common stock could decline sharply due to the following factors  among others quarterly and annual financial and operating results  failure to meet estimates or expectations of securities analysts  the timing of enrollment and results of our clinical trials  including our ongoing studies of oral treprostinil for pah  physician  patient  investor or public concerns regarding the efficacy and or safety of products marketed or being developed by us or by others  changes in  or new legislation and regulations affecting reimbursement of  our therapeutic products by medicare or medicaid and changes in reimbursement policies of private health insurance companies  announcements by us or others of technological innovations or new products or announcements regarding our existing products  interference in patent or other proprietary rights  substantial sales of our common stock by us or our existing shareholders  future issuances of common stock by us or any other activity which could be viewed as being dilutive to our shareholders  rumors among or incorrect statements by investors and or analysts concerning our company  our products  or operations  failure to maintain  or changes to  our approvals to sell our products  discovery of previously unknown problems with our marketed products or problems with our manufacturing  regulatory  compliance  promotional  marketing or sales activities that result in regulatory restrictions on our products  including withdrawal of our products from the market  failure to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals from the fda and international regulatory agencies  accumulation of significant short positions in our common stock by hedge funds or other investors or the significant accumulation of our common stock by hedge funds or other institutional investors with investment strategies that may lead to short term holdings  timing and outcome of additional regulatory submissions and approvals  and general market conditions 

table of contents we may fail to meet third party projections for our revenues or profits 
many securities analysts publish independently developed quarterly and annual projections of our revenues and profits 
such estimates are inherently subject to uncertainty 
as a result  actual revenues and profits may differ from these projections  and even small variations in reported revenues and profits compared to securities analysts expectations could have a significant impact on the price of our common stock 
sales of our common stock may depress our stock price 
the price of our common stock could decline if we issue common stock to raise capital or to acquire a license or business  our shareholders transfer ownership of our common stock  or sell substantial amounts in the public market  or our investors become concerned that substantial sales of our common stock may occur 
for example  lilly has announced that they intend to sell a significant portion of our common stock they currently hold in a decrease in the price of our common stock could make it difficult for us to raise capital or fund acquisitions through the issuance of our stock 
the conversion of some or all of the convertible senior notes when the price of our common stock exceeds per share would dilute the ownership interests of our existing shareholders 
any sales of our common stock issued upon such conversion could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock 
furthermore  the existence of the convertible senior notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the convertible senior notes could depress the price of our common stock 
the fundamental change purchase feature of the convertible senior notes may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial attempt to take over our company 
we may be required to repurchase the convertible senior notes from their holders in the event of a fundamental change  which includes a change of control of our company 
this may delay or prevent a change of control of our company that would otherwise be beneficial to our shareholders 
provisions of delaware law and our certificate of incorporation  by laws  shareholder rights plan  and employment and license agreements could prevent or delay a change of control or change in management that may be beneficial to our public shareholders 
certain provisions of delaware law and our certificate of incorporation  by laws and shareholder rights plan may prevent  delay or discourage a merger  tender offer or proxy contest  the assumption of control by a holder of a large block of our securities  and or the replacement or removal of current management by our shareholders 
for example  our certificate of incorporation divides our board of directors into three classes 
members of each class are elected for staggered three year terms 
this provision may make it more difficult for shareholders to replace the majority of directors 
it may also deter the accumulation of large blocks of our common stock by limiting the voting power of such blocks 
non competition and all other restrictive covenants in most of our employment agreements will terminate upon a change of control that is not approved by our board 
we enter into certain license agreements that generally prohibit our counterparties to these agreements or their affiliates from taking necessary steps to acquire or merge with us  directly or indirectly throughout the term of these agreements  plus a specified period thereafter 
we are also party to certain license agreements that restrict our ability to assign or transfer the rights licensed to us 
table of contents to third parties  including parties with whom we wish to merge  or those attempting to acquire us 
these agreements often require that we obtain the prior consent of the counterparties to these agreements if we are contemplating a change of control 
if our counterparties to these agreements withhold their consent  related agreements could be terminated and we would lose related license rights 
for example  both lilly and toray have the right to terminate our license agreements relating to adcirca and beraprost mr  respectively  in the event of certain change of control transactions 
these restrictive change of control provisions could impede or prevent mergers that could benefit our shareholders 
our existing directors and executive officers own a substantial portion of our common stock and might be able to influence the outcome of matters requiring shareholder approval 
our directors and executive officers beneficially owned approximately percent of our outstanding common stock as of december  shares beneficially owned include stock options that could be exercised by those directors and executive officers within days of december  accordingly  these shareholders as a group may be able to influence the outcome of matters requiring shareholder approval  including the election of our directors 
such shareholder influence could delay or prevent a change of control that could benefit our shareholders 
because we do not intend to pay cash dividends  our shareholders must rely on stock appreciation for any return on their investment in us 
we have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock 
furthermore  we do not intend to pay cash dividends in the future 
as a result  the return on an investment in our common stock will depend entirely upon the future appreciation in the price of our common stock 
there can be no assurances that our common stock will provide a return to investors

all our properties and leased facilities  except for the lease space for medicomp  are used in our pharmaceutical segment 
item legal proceedings as previously disclosed in each of our quarterly reports on form q beginning with the quarter ended september   as well as in our annual report on form k for the year ended december   purported shareholders filed derivative lawsuits in the court of chancery for the state of delaware against certain of our directors and named executive officers relating to the adoption of our stap  the modification of awards granted under the stap  the exchange of certain stock options granted under our amended and restated equity incentive plan  and certain stock options awarded to our chief executive officer 
the parties entered into a stipulation to settle these lawsuits  and the court entered an order approving the stipulation and settlement on january  the period for appealing that order expired on february  the derivative lawsuits are  therefore  resolved

overview united therapeutics corporation is a biotechnology company focused on the development and commercialization of unique products to address the unmet medical needs of patients with chronic and life threatening conditions 
our key therapeutic products and product candidates include prostacyclin analogues remodulin and tyvaso stable synthetic forms of prostacyclin  an important molecule produced by the body that has powerful effects on blood vessel health and function  phosphodiesterase type pde inhibitor adcirca a molecule that acts to inhibit the degradation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate cgmp in cells 
cgmp is activated by nitric oxide  a naturally occurring substance in the body that mediates the relaxation of vascular smooth muscle  monoclonal antibodies ch mab and h mab antibodies that treat cancer by activating the immune system  and glycobiology antiviral agents miglustat and other agents a novel class of small  sugar like molecules that have shown antiviral activity in a range of pre clinical settings 
we concentrate substantially all of our research and development efforts on these key therapeutic programs 
our lead product is remodulin treprostinil injection remodulin for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension pah 
the united states food and drug administration fda initially approved remodulin in for subcutaneous under the skin administration 
subsequently  the fda broadened its approval of remodulin for intravenous in the vein use and for the treatment of patients who require transition from flolan  the first drug approved by the fda for the treatment of pah 
in addition to the united states  remodulin is approved in many other countries  primarily for subcutaneous use 
in may  the fda approved adcirca tadalafil tablets adcirca  an orally administered therapy for the treatment of pah to which we acquired certain exclusive commercialization rights from eli lilly and company lilly 
in july  the fda approved tyvaso treprostinil inhalation solution tyvaso  an inhaled therapy for the treatment of pah 
we launched both adcirca and tyvaso for commercial sale during the third quarter of with the introduction of these two new therapies  we now offer treatments to a broader range of patients who suffer from pah 
in addition  we are continuing to develop oral formulations of treprostinil and beraprost  both for the treatment of pah 

table of contents revenues sales of remodulin comprise the largest share of our revenues 
other sources of pharmaceutical revenues include sales of our recently approved therapies  tyvaso and adcirca 
since their commercial introduction in  sales of tyvaso and adcirca have continued to grow  as each of these therapies has gained broader market acceptance 
we sell remodulin and tyvaso in the united states to our specialty pharmaceutical distributors accredo health group  inc  curascript  inc  and cvs caremark 
adcirca is sold to pharmaceutical wholesalers that are part of lilly pharmaceutical wholesaler network 
we also sell remodulin to distributors outside of the united states 
we require our distributors to maintain reasonable levels of contingent inventory  with a minimum of a day supply  at all times  as the interruption of remodulin or tyvaso therapy can be life threatening 
consequently  sales of these therapies in any given quarter may not precisely reflect patient demand 
our distributors typically place one bulk order per month based on estimates of future demand and considerations of contractual minimum inventory requirements 
as a result  the sales volume of remodulin and tyvaso can vary  depending on the timing and magnitude of these orders 
in march and april of  we increased the price on all concentrations of remodulin sold to our us based and international distributors by percent and percent  respectively 
in addition  we increased the price of tyvaso by percent in november to offset the increasing cost of manufacture and distribution 
in january  lilly notified us that it was increasing the wholesale price of adcirca by percent 
in march  president obama signed into law the patient protection and affordable care act  as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act collectively  the acts 
the acts contain broad provisions that will be implemented over the next several years 
we are currently evaluating the impact of the acts on our business  however  our evaluation is dependent upon the issuance of final regulations and the impact this legislation will have on insurance companies and their relationships with drug manufacturers 
we were not materially impacted by the acts during the year ended december  however  the potential future impact of the acts on our business is inherently difficult to project as many of the details regarding the implementation of this legislation are yet to be determined 
presently  we have not yet identified any provisions that could materially impact our business  but will continue to monitor future developments of this legislation 
effective january   the acts increased the minimum rate for rebates pharmaceutical companies must provide to medicaid on certain pharmaceutical products from percent to percent 
this increase applies to rebates for remodulin  tyvaso and adcirca 
based on our evaluation of medicare rebates for the year ended december   the increase in the rate for medicaid rebates decreased our net revenues by less than one percent 
furthermore  over the last three years  less than ten percent of prescriptions for our drugs have been reimbursed by medicaid 
as such  we do not expect this provision of the acts to materially impact our future revenues 
total revenues are reported net of estimated rebates and other reimbursements  prompt pay discounts  service fees to our distributors  and allowances for product returns or exchanges 
estimates of our liability for rebates and reimbursements are derived from an analysis of historical levels of rebates reimbursements to both state medicaid agencies and third party payers by product relative to sales of each product 
prompt pay discounts are provided on sales of our commercial products if the related invoices are paid in full within a specific time period 
we estimate our liability for prompt pay discounts based on observed customer payment behavior 
fees paid to our distributors for services are estimated based on contractual rates for specific services applied to the estimated units of service provided for the period 
the allowance for sales returns for adcirca is estimated based on published industry data related to specialty pharmaceuticals  which is the segment most relevant to adcirca 
the allowance for exchanges for remodulin is based on the historical rate of product exchanges  which has been too immaterial to record 
in addition  because tyvaso is distributed in the 
table of contents same manner and under similar contractual arrangements as remodulin  the level of product exchanges for tyvaso has been comparable to that of remodulin and we anticipate minimal exchange activity in the future for both products 
during the fourth quarter of  we increased our sales and marketing department by approximately personnel 
this initiative was designed to increase demand for our products through greater exposure and interaction with prescribers 
in addition to our pharmaceutical revenues  other sources of revenue consist primarily of sales of telemedicine products and services in the united states 
our telemedicine products and services are designed to detect cardiac arrhythmias and ischemic heart disease 
on february   we entered into a merger agreement with a group of private investors to sell medicomp  our telemedicine subsidiary 
we expect this transaction to close in march or april  assuming the timely receipt of required regulatory approvals 
for further details  see note subsequent event to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
expenses since our inception  we have devoted substantial resources to our various research and development initiatives 
accordingly  we incur considerable costs related to our clinical trials and research  conducted both internally and by third parties  on a variety of projects to develop pharmaceutical products 
we also seek to license or acquire promising technologies and or compounds to be incorporated into our development pipeline 
our operating expenses can be materially impacted by the recognition of share based compensation relating to our share tracking awards plan stap and any awards of stock option grants 
stap awards are required to be measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period using inputs and assumptions that can materially impact the amount of compensation expense for a given period 
additionally  some  or all of the following factors  among others  can cause substantial variability in the amount of share based compensation recognized period to period changes in the price of our common stock  changes in the number of outstanding awards  and changes in both the number of vested awards and the time awards have accrued toward vesting 
for further details  see note share tracking awards plan to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
generally  our stock option grants are measured at fair value at the date of grant 
the fair value of stock option grants is recognized as compensation expense over the service period  which typically coincides with the vesting period of related options 
we recognize all compensation expense immediately for grants that are fully vested at the date of grant 
for further details on stock options  see note stockholders equity to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
major research and development projects our major research and development projects focus on the use of prostacyclin analogues to treat cardiovascular diseases  monoclonal antibodies to treat a variety of cancers  and glycobiology antiviral agents to treat infectious diseases 
cardiopulmonary disease projects tyvaso upon receiving fda approval of tyvaso for the treatment of pah in july  we launched the product for commercial sale in september in connection with the tyvaso approval  we agreed to a post marketing requirement pmr and certain post marketing commitments pmcs 
pmrs and pmcs often obligate sponsors to conduct studies after fda approval to gather additional information 
table of contents about a product safety  efficacy  or optimal use 
pmrs are required studies  whereas pmcs are voluntary commitments 
we are required to provide the fda annual updates on our pmr and pmcs 
failure to complete or adhere to the timelines set forth by the fda for the pmr could result in penalties  including fines or withdrawal of tyvaso from the market  unless we are able to demonstrate good cause for the failure or delay 
in accordance with our pmr  we recently commenced patient enrollment in a long term observational study in the us that will include  patient years of follow up in patients treated with tyvaso  and  patient years of follow up in control patients receiving other pah treatments 
this study will allow us to continue to assess the safety of tyvaso 
we are currently required to submit the results of the study by december   but we have requested an extension to this timeline 
the pmcs require us to modify particular aspects of the tyvaso inhalation system 
as part of these modifications  we agreed to perform a usability analysis incorporating the evaluation and prioritization of user related risk followed by a human factors study 
we submitted proposed modifications to the device to the fda in accordance with the pmcs and completed the related human factors study 
the fda has requested further modifications to the device and a follow up usability study once these additional modifications are complete 
as a result of the further modifications and follow up usability study  we have requested an extension to the original october  timeline for completion of the pmcs 
our request is under review by the fda 
in june  the fda granted orphan drug designation for tyvaso 
such a designation confers an exclusivity period during which the fda may not approve any application to market the same drug for the same indication  except in limited circumstances 
in december  we began enrolling patients in an open label study in the united states to investigate the effects of switching patients on ventavis  another inhaled prostacyclin analogue  to tyvaso 
we recently completed the study  in which improvements in patient quality of life were observed 
final data is being prepared for presentation at scientific symposia 
oral treprostinil in december  we initiated two phase iii clinical trials  freedom c and freedom m  to evaluate the safety and efficacy of oral treprostinil in patients with pah 
freedom c was a study of patients currently on approved background therapy using a pde inhibitor  such as revatio  or an endothelin receptor antagonist  such as tracleer  or a combination of both 
we completed enrollment for freedom c in may and in november announced that freedom c failed to achieve statistical significance for the primary endpoint of six minute walk distance 
preliminary analysis of the data revealed that the initial dose of mg was too high  which contributed to an inability to dose titrate increase the dose to tolerability  prevented the attainment of optimal dosing levels and led to higher dropout rates than we anticipated 
consequently  the overall treatment effect of the therapy was muted 
we believe  however  that the results of the freedom c clinical trial  particularly as they relate to treatment effect and dosing  warrant our continued development of oral treprostinil 
accordingly  we commenced an additional phase iii clinical trial  freedom c  to continue studying dosage and efficacy of oral treprostinil in pah patients on an approved background therapy 
enrollment in freedom c began in june in the freedom c study  patients are provided access to a lower strength tablet mg and doses are being titrated in mg to mg increments 
we estimate that this trial will be fully enrolled in april  in which case we expect to unblind and announce preliminary analysis of the trial in september freedom m is a week study of newly diagnosed pah patients not currently on any background therapy 
based on our observations from the freedom c clinical trial relating to patient 
table of contents tolerability and tablet strength  we submitted a protocol amendment to the fda in february to add patients to the ongoing freedom m trial 
these additional patients were provided a lower strength tablet mg when beginning the trial and doses were titrated in mg to mg increments  which we believe improved tolerability 
in addition  we submitted an amendment to our statistical analysis plan  specifying that the primary statistical analysis of the trial will include only those patients who started the trial using the mg tablet 
by amending the protocol for freedom m we hope to assess more accurately the effectiveness of oral treprostinil  improve patient tolerability of oral treprostinil so that an effective maintenance dose can be attained  and reduce the rate of premature discontinuation due to adverse events 
the statistical assumptions of the amended protocol provide for percent power confidence rate to observe a meter treatment benefit in six minute walk distance at the significance level of 
on january  we completed enrollment of freedom m with patients  compared to target enrollment of patients  and expect to unblind and announce preliminary analysis of the results of the clinical trial in june we have also introduced a mg tablet  which allows us to start patients on an even lower strength tablet  and titrate doses in smaller increments for both freedom c and freedom m  if needed 
beraprost mr pursuant to our license agreement with toray industries  inc toray  we are developing a modified release formulation of beraprost mr  an oral prostacyclin analogue  for the treatment of pah 
in october  beraprost mr received regulatory approval in japan for the treatment of pah 
we have completed enrollment of a phase ii clinical trial of beraprost to explore multiple dose tolerability in patients with pah and we have begun a second phase ii clinical trial 
in september  we entered into a supplement to our license agreement with toray under which we agreed on the timing of two milestone payments provided for under our existing agreement  in the amounts of million and million 
all conditions relating to these milestone payments were satisfied in the fourth quarter of  accordingly  during the quarter we paid toray million and recognized a million liability and associated expense relating to the second milestone payment  which will be paid to toray during the first quarter of although the second milestone payment is not due until the first quarter  we accrued and expensed the payment in because the contingencies affecting this milestone payment were satisfied during the fourth quarter of these milestone payments were expensed as incurred since beraprost mr has not demonstrated commercial feasibility 
collagen type v pursuant to our february development agreement with immuneworks  inc  lung rx is developing a purified bovine type v collagen oral solution called iw for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ipf  a progressive lung disease characterized by abnormal and excessive fibrotic tissue in the lungs  and primary graft dysfunction  a type of organ rejection that can occur in lung transplants 
human clinical testing of iw has commenced  and a phase i clinical trial in patients with ipf is ongoing 
from inception to december   we have spent million on our cardiopulmonary disease programs 
cancer disease projects ch antibody in july  we entered into a cooperative research and development agreement crada with the national cancer institute nci to collaborate on the late stage development and regulatory agency submissions of chimeric monoclonal antibody ch for children with high risk 
table of contents neuroblastoma and patients with other forms of cancer 
ch is an antibody that has shown potential in the treatment of certain types of cancer by targeting gd  a glycolipid on the surface of tumor cells 
under the terms of the crada  nci will conduct a clinical trial in approximately patients to define more clearly the safety and toxicity profile of ch immunotherapy in children and we will develop the commercial manufacturing capability for the antibody 
as part of developing our commercial manufacturing capability  we will need to demonstrate comparability of our ch to the nci produced ch  which typically includes a series of analytical and bioanalytical assays and human pharmacokinetics 
the nci studies  including a previously conducted related phase iii clinical trial and all other necessary studies supported by nci will be used as the basis for a biologics license application seeking fda approval of ch immunotherapy for the treatment of neuroblastoma 
f and h antibodies in december  we entered into two agreements with memorial sloan kettering cancer center to license certain rights to two investigational monoclonal antibodies f for the treatment of neuroblastoma and h for the treatment of metastatic brain cancer 
we terminated our license to f during the fourth quarter of given the overlap between this program and the ch program 
we have spent million from inception to december   on our cancer programs 
infectious disease projects pursuant to our research agreement with the university of oxford oxford  we have the exclusive right to commercialize a platform of glycobiology antiviral drug candidates in various preclinical and clinical stages of testing for the treatment of a wide variety of viruses 
through our research agreement with oxford  we are also supporting research into new glycobiology antiviral drug candidates and technologies 
we are currently testing many of these compounds in preclinical studies and oxford continues to synthesize new agents for us to test 
we have spent million from inception to december   on our infectious disease programs 
cost of product sales cost of product sales comprises costs to manufacture and acquire products sold to customers  and royalty payments under license agreements granting us rights to sell related products 
we manufacture forms of treprostinil using advanced intermediate compounds purchased in bulk from several third party vendors that have the capacity to produce greater quantities of these compounds more cost effectively than we do 
in  we received regulatory approval in both the united states and the european union to produce treprostinil in our facility in silver spring  maryland 
our manufacturing process has been designed to give us the flexibility to produce the forms of treprostinil used in remodulin  tyvaso  and our oral tablet  based on forecasted demand for each of these products 
the approved shelf lives for both remodulin and tyvaso are months 
to ensure sufficient availability of remodulin and tyvaso at all times  we maintain inventories of these products equivalent to approximately three years of expected demand 
we acquired the rights to the tyvaso inhalation system from nebu tec in september tyvaso is generally sold as a starter kit for new patients and as a resupply kit for monthly prescription refills 
the tyvaso starter kits consist of the tyvaso inhalation system  which includes two nebulizers and a twenty eight day supply of tyvaso 
the monthly resupply kits contain a twenty eight day supply of tyvaso and daily supplies only 
because the starter kits contain two nebulizers  the cost of product sales for the starter kits is higher than the resupply kit 
we currently manufacture the tyvaso inhalation system in germany using labor supplied by nebu tec 
in addition  we received fda approval in december for minnetronix  inc to manufacture the tyvaso inhalation system and for quality 
table of contents tech services  inc to package daily supplies 
catalent pharma solutions  inc catalent continues to manufacture tyvaso 
in  we amended our contract with our remodulin manufacturer  baxter pharmaceutical solutions  llc baxter  to extend the contract term through as part of that contract amendment  we agreed that baxter will manufacture remodulin in greater quantities using larger capacity production equipment 
this new manufacturing process and related equipment will require fda and international regulatory approvals 
we are currently conducting validation testing for the new equipment and process 
until fda approval of the new process and equipment  baxter continues to manufacture remodulin using the approved process and equipment 
in january  we received fda approval of hollister stier laboratories llc as a second manufacturer for remodulin in the larger quantities discussed above 
we are actively working to obtain approval for the commercial manufacture remodulin and tyvaso in our silver spring facility 
our goal is to become the primary manufacturer with contracted third party manufacturers supplementing our manufacturing capacity 
lilly manufactures and distributes adcirca through its wholesaler network in the same manner that it distributes its own pharmaceutical products 
under the terms of this agreement  we take title to adcirca upon completion of its manufacture by lilly 
adcirca is shipped to customers  generally pharmaceutical wholesalers  in accordance with purchase orders received by lilly 
although lilly provides these services on our behalf  we maintain the risk of loss as it pertains to inventory and non payment of invoices 
we acquired the rights to sell our commercial products through license and assignment agreements with the developers of these products  as described in the section entitled item business patents and proprietary rights 
these agreements obligate us to pay royalties generally on the net revenues from the products 
while the royalties vary by agreement  we pay royalties on our current commercial products at a rate of to of net revenues 
future prospects because pah remains a progressive disease without a cure  we expect continued growth in the demand for our commercial products as viable alternatives or complements to other approved therapies 
furthermore  the commercial introduction of tyvaso and adcirca allows us to offer products to more patients along the full continuum of the disease 
since  we have experienced annual revenue growth in excess of percent and one of our principal objectives is to sustain industry leading revenue growth 
the continued achievement of this objective will depend in large part upon the successful commercial development of products within our pipeline 
to this end  we continue to develop oral treprostinil and beraprost and seek to expand the use of our therapies to treat patients at earlier stages in the pah disease progression and to treat other conditions 
we believe the outcome of our freedom m and freedom c phase iii clinical trials of oral treprostinil will be successful 
furthermore  we anticipate that the products developed under these clinical trials will generate future sources of revenue 
however  prior to fda approval of oral treprostinil for marketing  we could be required to perform additional studies 
this could cause unexpected delays in the commercialization of oral treprostinil and could impede our anticipated revenue growth 
our future growth and profitability will depend on many factors including  among others the timing and outcome of clinical trials and regulatory approvals  including those relating to oral treprostinil and the pmcs and pmr relating to the fda approval of tyvaso  the timing of the commercial launch of remodulin and tyvaso in new markets and of new products  the pricing of and demand for our products and services  reimbursement of our products by public and private insurance organizations  and the competition we face within our industry 

table of contents we operate in a highly competitive market in which a small number of pharmaceutical companies control a majority of the currently approved pah therapies 
these pharmaceutical companies not only possess greater visibility in the market  but also greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
in addition  there are a number of investigational products in development that  if approved  may erode the market share of our existing commercial therapies and make market acceptance more difficult to achieve for any therapies we market in the future

liquidity and capital resources since fda approval of remodulin in  funding for our operations has been derived principally from sales of remodulin 
sales of tyvaso and adcirca  which were commercially launched in the third quarter of  have supplemented our revenues 
we believe that our current liquidity is sufficient to repay amounts that will become due in october relating to our convertible senior notes and that existing revenues and related collections will be adequate to fund our ongoing operations as demand for our commercial products is expected to grow 
furthermore  our customer base remains stable and  we believe  presents minimal credit risk  however  any projections of future cash flows are inherently subject to uncertainty 
to compensate for such uncertainty  we may seek other sources of funding and

we expect to complete the approximately  square foot expansion of our rtp facility by mid at an anticipated cost of approximately million  which includes construction  equipment and other related costs 
our previous corporate headquarters and two adjoining buildings that were located adjacent to our silver spring facility were demolished in september to begin the construction of a new office building to serve as part of our corporate headquarters campus 
we anticipate total construction costs of approximately million and expect to complete this office facility during the fourth quarter of during the year ended december   we spent million related to these construction projects 

table of contents share tracking awards plan awards granted under the stap entitle participants to receive in cash the appreciation in our common stock  which is calculated as the increase in the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant and the date of exercise 
depending on the future price movements of our common stock  cash requirements associated with the exercise of awards could be significant 
we incorporate anticipated cash outlays relating to the stap in our operating budgets and have modified the metrics used in determining the number of awards to be granted in order to decrease the size of related grants 
in addition  since november  we have increased the vesting period for awards granted from three years to four years 
during the first quarter of  we expect to increase the pool of available stap awards by approximately million awards  primarily to accommodate anticipated grants under our long term incentive bonus and compensation plan

proceeds from the loan were used to pay off the synthetic lease arrangement with wachovia discussed below and will also be used to help fund working capital requirements 
the credit agreement has a forty eight month term maturing in december and is secured by a first mortgage lien on our rtp facility and our silver spring facility 
annual principal payments will be based on a twenty five year amortization schedule using a fixed rate of interest of percent  accordingly  a principal balance of approximately million will be due at maturity 
outstanding debt will bear a floating rate of interest per annum based on the one month london interbank offer rate libor  plus a credit spread of percent  or approximately percent as of december  alternatively  we have the option to change the rate of interest charged on the loan to percent plus the greater of wells fargo prime rate  or the federal funds effective rate plus percent  or libor plus percent 
the credit agreement also permits prepayment of the outstanding loan balance in its entirety at specified intervals 
the prepayment premium is initially percent if the debt is prepaid within the first six months of the term and declines in percent increments at each successive six month interval such that there is no premium if the loan is prepaid after december the credit agreement subjects us to the following financial covenants a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of  calculated as the ratio of our consolidated indebtedness to consolidated ebitda  which is defined as consolidated net income  adjusted for the following as applicable i interest expense  ii income taxes  iii non cash license fees  iv depreciation and amortization  v impairment charges  and vi share based compensation stock option and share tracking award expense  to be measured as of the last day of each fiscal quarter on a rolling four quarter basis  and minimum liquidity of no less than million 
under the credit agreement  minimum liquidity is defined as the sum of our cash and cash equivalents  plus the fair value of our marketable investments as of the last day of a fiscal quarter less the sum of indebtedness that matures within the next twelve months and the liability related to vested stap awards in excess of million 
in addition  the credit agreement subjects us to various customary negative covenants 
as of december   we were in compliance with the preceding covenants 
lease obligation until december  we leased our phase i laboratory  the first completed building in our current silver spring facility  pursuant to a synthetic lease arrangement entered into in june with wachovia development corporation and its affiliates wachovia  now an affiliate of wells fargo

convertible senior notes on october   we issued at par value million of convertible senior notes 
we pay interest on the convertible senior notes semi annually on april and october of each year 
the convertible senior notes are unsecured  unsubordinated debt obligations that rank equally with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness 
conversion can occur any time after july   during any calendar quarter that follows a calendar quarter in which the price of our common stock exceeded of the conversion price for at least days during the consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day of the quarter  during the ten consecutive trading day period following any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price of the convertible senior notes was less than of the closing price of our common stock multiplied by the then current number of shares underlying the convertible senior notes  upon specified distributions to our shareholders  in connection with corporate transactions  or in the event that our common stock ceases to be listed on the nasdaq global select market and is not listed for trading on another us national or regional securities exchange 
upon conversion  a holder of our convertible senior notes will receive cash equal to the lesser of the principal amount of the note or the conversion value equal to the number of shares underlying the convertible senior notes multiplied by the then current conversion price per share  and to the extent the conversion value exceeds the principal amount of the convertible senior notes  shares of our common stock 
in the event of a change in control  as defined in the indenture under which the convertible senior notes have been issued  holders can require us to purchase from them all or a portion of their convertible senior notes for of the principal value plus any accrued and unpaid interest 
because the convertible senior notes include contingent conversion provisions  note holders may be able to convert their convertible senior notes prior to october as of december   the convertible senior notes were convertible at the election of their holders as the closing price of our common stock satisfied quarterly contingent conversion requirements 
common stock subject to repurchase pursuant to a march amendment to our june agreement with toray  we issued  shares of our common stock to toray in march the terms of our amended agreement expand our rights to develop beraprost mr and give toray the right to request that we repurchase these shares at their issuance price of per share upon days prior written notice 
to date  toray has not notified us that it intends to ask us to repurchase these shares 
license fees under our existing license agreements  we are obligated to make royalty payments on net sales of remodulin and tyvaso at a rate of ten percent of net sales  as defined under the agreements  once the annual combined net sales exceed million

revenue recognition remodulin and tyvaso we sell both remodulin and tyvaso to our specialty pharmaceutical distributors under similar contractual arrangements 
sales of remodulin and tyvaso are recognized when title and risk of ownership pass to our distributors upon satisfactory delivery to our distributors facilities ie  when all of our performance obligations under these distributor arrangements have been satisfied 
we record sales of remodulin and tyvaso net of various product sales allowances in the period that associated revenues are recognized 
these sales allowances include estimated rebates and other reimbursements  prompt payment discounts and service fees to our distributors 
calculating these sales allowances involves the use of significant estimates and judgments and information from external sources 
estimates for accruals and related revenue reductions for rebates and reimbursements are derived from an analysis of historical levels of rebates reimbursements to both state medicaid agencies and third party payers by product  relative to sales of each product 
in formulating our estimates  we also consider the impact of anticipated changes in product sales trends and government rebate programs  particularly as they relate to eligibility requirements and or rebate pricing 
we analyze rebate data separately for remodulin and tyvaso  as these therapies have been developed to treat pah patients at different stages in the disease continuum and therefore  rebate eligibility and pricing requirements can differ for each therapy 
prompt pay discounts are calculated based on the gross amount of invoices and are recorded on a net basis as our distributors have routinely taken advantage of these discounts 
we pay our distributors for contractual services rendered 
accruals for these fees are estimated based on contracted rates applied to the estimated units of service provided by distributors for a given period 
our distributors do not possess return rights  however  we provide exchange rights in the event that product was damaged during shipment  or has expired 
the shelf life of remodulin and tyvaso is three years from the date of manufacture 
the number of product exchanges requested by our distributors has been minimal because we sell remodulin and tyvaso with a shelf life generally in excess of one year before their expiration and our distributors typically carry a to day inventory supply of our products 
in addition  we do not require  nor do we provide incentives for our distributors to assume inventory levels of remodulin or tyvaso beyond what would be considered reasonable and customary in the ordinary course of business and we closely track inventory levels in the distribution channels 
accordingly  exchanges for expired product have been minimal 
in addition  exchanges for damaged product are highly infrequent 
when remodulin or tyvaso has been damaged during shipment and we have been promptly notified as required under our distributor arrangements  we do not recognize revenue on that shipment until the damaged product has been replaced  generally within several days after we are notified of the damage 
the financial effects of exchange rights for remodulin have been immaterial and we expect the volume of exchanges to be consistent with historical levels 
obsolescence due to dating expiration has also been minimal given the fast pace at which remodulin moves through the distribution channel 
specifically  remodulin exchanges have comprised substantially less than one percent of the volume of vials that we sell 
because historical and anticipated future exchanges of remodulin have been  and are expected to be  immaterial  we do not record a reserve for estimated exchange rights in the period of sale 
furthermore  because tyvaso is distributed in the same manner and under similar contractual arrangements as remodulin  the level of product exchanges for tyvaso has been  and is expected to 
table of contents remain  comparable to that for remodulin 
since its commercial launch  there have not been any tyvaso exchanges 
accordingly  we have not recognized a reserve for anticipated future exchanges of tyvaso 
lastly  we closely monitor exchange data for both of these therapies to ensure that our assumptions continue to be reasonable  appropriate and current 
adcirca adcirca is manufactured for us by lilly and distributed through lilly pharmaceutical wholesaler network 
specifically  lilly handles all of the administrative functions associated with the sale of adcirca on our behalf  including the receipt and processing of customer purchase orders  shipment of adcirca to customers  and the invoicing and collection of customer payments 
in addition  sales terms for adcirca include return rights that extend throughout the distribution channel 
we recognize sales of adcirca on a gross basis net of allowances upon delivery to customers due to the following factors we are responsible for the acceptability of the product purchased by wholesalers  we bear all inventory risk  as title and risk of loss pass to us at the shipping point from lilly manufacturing facility  we assume credit risk if lilly is unable to collect amounts due from customers  and we assume the risk and cost of a product recall  if required 
adcirca revenues are recognized net of the following sales allowances reserves for product returns  rebates for medicaid and third party payers  prompt pay discounts and wholesaler fees 
calculation of these allowances involves the use of significant judgment and estimates 
until we have sufficient historical data to base estimates for product returns  we have based initial estimates for returns on published industry data related to specialty pharmaceuticals  which is the segment most relevant to adcirca 
in addition  we compare patient prescription data to sales on a quarterly basis to ensure a reasonable relationship between prescription and sales patterns 
allowances for medicaid and other third party payer rebates are derived from an analysis of historical levels of rebates reimbursements to both state medicaid agencies and third party payers 
prompt pay discounts are based on contractual terms with distributors  and they typically have taken advantage of such discounts 
lastly  wholesaler fees are based on the contractual fee percentage for each wholesaler relative to sales to that wholesaler 
share based compensation our share based awards are classified as either equity stock options or as liabilities stap awards  and we recognize related share based compensation expense based on the fair value of awards 
we estimate the fair value of all share based awards using the black scholes merton valuation model 
valuation models  like the black scholes merton model  require the use of subjective assumptions that could materially impact the estimation of fair value and related compensation expense to be recognized 
these assumptions include  among others  the expected volatility of our stock price  the expected term of awards and the expected forfeiture rate 
developing these assumptions requires the use of judgment 
marketable investments substantially all of our marketable securities are classified as held to maturity 
for marketable investments whose fair value is lower than their book value  we are required to periodically review whether the decline in the value of these securities are other than temporary 
this review requires us to make judgments  particularly as they relate to the extent and duration of a decline in the fair value of a security  the probability  extent and timing of a recovery of a security value  our assessment as to whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell a security prior to recovery of its amortized cost  and our estimation of the present value of the cash flows we would expect to collect that are attributable to an impaired debt security to determine whether a credit loss exists 
the scope of this evaluation requires forward looking assessments pertaining to a security and 
table of contents the relevant financial markets  an issuer financial condition and business outlook  and our estimation of the value of cash flows we would expect to collect from an issuer upon maturity of an impaired security 
accordingly  we must make assessments regarding current conditions and future events  which involve a considerable degree of uncertainty and judgment 
when we determine that the decline in value of a security is other than temporary  we are required to recognize the credit loss portion as a charge within our consolidated statement of operations 
in addition  we classify certain marketable investments as held to maturity because we believe we have the positive intent and ability to hold related securities until they mature 
this assertion requires us to make forward looking judgments regarding our future cash flow requirements relative to the maturity dates of such securities 
to reduce the level of uncertainty associated in making this determination  we invest in debt securities that mature within two years 
fair value measurements we are required to disclose assets and liabilities subject to fair value measurements within a specified fair value hierarchy 
the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to fair value measurements based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level measurements and the lowest priority to fair value measurements derived through the use of unobservable inputs level measurements 
assets and liabilities are classified within the fair value hierarchy  in their entirety  based on the lowest level input that is significant to the related fair value measurement 
determining where a particular asset or liability should be disclosed within the hierarchy involves judgment regarding the significance of inputs relative to a fair value measurement and where such inputs lie within the hierarchy 
furthermore  assets and liabilities that are not actively traded may have little or no price transparency 
as such  estimating the fair value of level assets and liabilities involves the use of significant subjective assumptions that we believe market participants would consider in pricing 
we often employ a discounted cash flow model to help us estimate the fair value of our level assets and liabilities 
inputs to the model that involve a significant degree of judgment include estimating the amounts and timing of expected cash flows and determining a suitable discount rate 
investment in affiliate we use the equity method of accounting for our investment in northern therapeutics  inc northern 
the equity method of accounting requires that we report our share of northern net losses or earnings in our consolidated financial statements 
consolidation is not required unless we possess the ability to control northern 
generally  the ability to exercise control over an entity occurs when voting interests in that entity exceed 
we maintain an ownership interest in northern of approximately 
however  because northern minority owners have substantive participation rights  we concluded that we do not have the ability to control northern operations 
therefore  northern financial statements have not been included in our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for in accordance with the asset and liability method 
accordingly  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in our opinion  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
evaluating the realizability of deferred assets requires us to review forecasts of earnings and taxable income  among other considerations 
accordingly  the evaluation process as it relates to the realizability of deferred tax 
table of contents assets requires us to make significant judgments and forward looking assessments regarding the amounts and availability of future taxable income 
financial statement recognition of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return is determined based on a more likely than not threshold of that position being sustained 
if the tax position meets this threshold  the benefit to be recognized is measured as the largest amount that is more than percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
accounting for uncertain tax positions involves considerable judgment in assessing the future tax consequences of amounts that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
the ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions could result in amounts different from those recognized on our consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and intangible assets we are required to test goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators exist 
evaluating goodwill for impairment requires judgment particularly as it relates to determining the fair value of a reporting unit to which goodwill has been assigned 
we often use a discounted cash flow model to test goodwill for impairment  which involves the use of significant and subjective inputs 
inputs requiring our judgment include  among others  the estimation of the amounts and timing of future cash flows and future growth rates and profitability of a reporting unit 
changes in our business strategy or adverse changes in market conditions could impact impairment analyses and require the recognition of an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over its implied estimated fair value 
we also test our intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators exist 
evaluating intangible assets for impairment requires judgment particularly as it relates to determining the fair value of the license or business to which the intangible asset relates 
we must project cash flows to test an intangible asset for impairment  which involves the use of significant and subjective inputs 
related inputs  among others  requiring our judgment include the estimation of the amounts and timing of future cash flows and future growth rates and profitability of business activity 
changes in our business strategy or adverse changes in market conditions could impact impairment analyses and require the recognition of an impairment charge equal to the extent that undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of an intangible asset 
pension benefit obligation accounting for our serp requires that we recognize on our consolidated balance sheet a liability equal to the unfunded status of the serp equal to the projected benefit obligation  as we do not fund the serp and measure our projected benefit obligation as of the end of our fiscal year 
estimating the serp obligation involves the use of judgment and estimates 
the serp obligation and related pension expense are derived from actuarial valuations that are developed using a number of assumptions 
a key assumption to the valuation is the discount rate 
the discount rate should be representative of the rate associated with high quality  fixed income debt securities 
with the overall economic downturn and the tightening of the credit markets that began in  interest rates  in general  have declined 
we must consider these economic factors when determining an appropriate discount rate to employ 
consequently  the discount rate we use to measure our obligation has decreased over each of the years ended december  and changes in the discount rate can significantly decrease or increase our serp obligation 
for instance  a reduction in the discount rate would increase our projected benefit obligation  result in an actuarial loss and possibly cause additional pension expense to be recognized in future financial reporting periods on our consolidated statements of operations if certain thresholds have been met as of the beginning of a given financial reporting period 
other actuarial assumptions include participant demographics such as the expected rate of salary increases and withdrawal rates  among other factors 
actual experience may differ from actuarial 
table of contents assumptions 
changes in any of these assumptions can also affect the measurement of the serp obligation 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic when to perform step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts asu 
asu modifies the first step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit is zero or negative  the second step of the impairment test must be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any  when it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
in considering whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists  an entity shall evaluate whether any adverse qualitative factors exist 
asu no 
is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december  we are currently assessing what  if any  impact the adoption of asu will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued asu no 
 revenue recognition milestone method asu no 

asu no 
sets forth guidance on the criteria that should be met for determining whether the milestone method of revenue recognition is appropriate for research and development arrangements 
specifically  consideration that is contingent upon the completion of a milestone may be recognized in its entirety as revenue in the period that the milestone has been achieved if the milestone  in its entirety  meets all of the criteria to be considered substantive at the inception of a research and development arrangement 
asu no 
is effective prospectively for milestones achieved in fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning on or after june  and applies to research or development deliverables under which the performance obligation is satisfied over a period of time and a portion  or all  of the consideration is contingent upon uncertain future events or circumstances 
a reporting entity decision to use the milestone method of revenue recognition is a policy election 
asu no 
will be effective for us january  and adoption of this standard will not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued asu no 
 fair value measurements and disclosures topic improving disclosures about fair value measurements asu no 

asu no 
requires fair value disclosures of assets and liabilities by class  disclosures about significant transfers in and out of levels and on the fair value hierarchy  in addition to level  purchases  sales  issuances and settlements be disclosed on a gross basis on the reconciliation of beginning and ending balances of level assets and liabilities  and disclosures about valuation methods and inputs used to measure the fair value of level assets and liabilities 
asu no 
became effective for the first financial reporting period beginning after december   except for disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements of level assets and liabilities  which will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  adoption of the currently effective provisions of asu no

 consolidations topic improvements to financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities asu no 

asu requires a qualitative approach for determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and replaces the quantitative evaluation previously set forth under fasb interpretation no 
revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities 
this approach is focused on identifying the reporting entity that has the ability to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly affects the entity economic performance and has the obligation to absorb the entity losses or has the right to receive benefits from the entity 
asu no 
 among other 
table of contents things  will require enhanced disclosures about a reporting entity involvement in variable interest entities 
the guidance under asu no 
became effective for the first annual period beginning after november   and interim periods within that first annual period 
adoption of asu did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued asu no 
 revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force asu 
asu establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of each element within a multiple deliverable arrangement 
specifically  the selling price assigned to each deliverable is to be based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if available  third party evidence if vsoe is unavailable  and estimated selling prices if neither vsoe or third party evidence is available 
in addition  asu eliminates the residual method of allocating arrangement consideration and instead requires allocation using the relative selling price method 
asu will be effective prospectively for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements entered into  or materially modified  in fiscal years beginning on or after june  asu will be effective for us on january  and adoption of this standard will not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   we have invested million in debt securities issued by corporations and federally sponsored agencies 
the market value of these investments varies inversely with changes in current market interest rates 
in general  as rates increase  the market value of a debt investment would be expected to decrease 
conversely  as rates decrease  the market value of a debt investment would be expected to increase 
to address market risk  we invest in debt securities that mature within two years and intend to hold these investments to maturity so that they can be redeemed at their stated or face value 
at december   our investments in debt securities issued by corporations and federally sponsored agencies had a weighted average stated interest rate of approximately percent 
these investments mature at various times through and many are callable annually 
there has been an extended period of instability in the financial markets 
such periods of uncertainty in the financial markets expose us to additional investment risk 
the value and liquidity of the securities in which we invest could deteriorate and the issuers of such securities could be subject to credit rating downgrades 
in light of these risks  we actively monitor market conditions and developments specific to the securities and security classes in which we invest 
we believe that we take a conservative approach to investing our funds in that we invest exclusively in highly rated securities with relatively short maturities 
while we believe we take prudent measures to mitigate investment related risks  such risks cannot be fully eliminated  as circumstances can occur that are beyond our control
