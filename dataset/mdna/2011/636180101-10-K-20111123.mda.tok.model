the information in md a should be read in conjunction with the company s financial statements in item of this report 
for the year ended september  compared to the year ended september   the company experienced an increase in earnings of million 
the earnings increase is primarily due to the recognition of a gain on the sale of unconsolidated subsidiaries of million million after tax during the quarter ended march  in the all other category 
in february  the company sold its equity method investments in seneca energy and model city for million 
seneca energy and 
table of contents model city generate and sell electricity using methane gas obtained from landfills owned by outside parties 
the sale is the result of the company s strategy to pursue the sale of smaller  non core assets in order to focus on its core businesses  including the development of the marcellus shale and the expansion of its pipeline business throughout the appalachian region 
for further discussion of the company s earnings  refer to the results of operations section below 
the marcellus shale is a middle devonian age geological shale formation that is present nearly a mile or more below the surface in the appalachian region of the united states  including much of pennsylvania and southern new york 
due to the depth at which this formation is found  drilling and completion costs  including the drilling and completion of horizontal wells with hydraulic fracturing  are very expensive 
however  independent geological studies have indicated that this formation could yield natural gas reserves measured in the trillions of cubic feet 
the company controls the natural gas interests associated with approximately  net acres within the marcellus shale area  with a majority of the interests held in fee  carrying no royalty and no lease expirations 
the company s reserve base has grown substantially from development in the marcellus shale 
natural gas proved developed and undeveloped reserves in the appalachian region have increased from bcf at september  to bcf at september  with this in mind  and with a natural desire to realize the value of these assets in a responsible and orderly fashion  the company has spent significant amounts of capital in this region 
for the year ended september   the company spent million towards the development of the marcellus shale 
this included paying million in november for the acquisition of additional oil and gas properties in the covington township area of tioga county  pennsylvania from eog resources  inc as the company has been accelerating its marcellus shale development  it has been decreasing its emphasis in the gulf coast region 
this culminated in the company entering into a purchase and sale agreement in march to sell its off shore oil and natural gas properties in the gulf of mexico effective as of january  the company completed the sale in april  receiving net proceeds of million 
under the full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties  the sale proceeds were accounted for as a reduction of capitalized costs in april the company also eliminated the asset retirement obligation associated with its off shore oil and gas properties 
this obligation amounted to million and was accounted for as a reduction of capitalized costs under the full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties as well as a reduction of the asset retirement obligation 
since the disposition did not significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil and gas attributable to the cost center  the company did not record any gain or loss from this sale 
coincident with the development of its marcellus shale acreage  the company s pipeline and storage segment is building pipeline gathering and transmission facilities to connect marcellus shale production with existing pipelines in the region and is pursuing the development of additional pipeline and storage capacity in order to meet anticipated demand for the large amount of marcellus shale production expected to come on line in the months and years to come 
two of the projects  the tioga county extension project and the northern access expansion project  are considered significant for empire and supply corporation 
both projects are designed to receive natural gas produced from the marcellus shale and transport it to canada and the northeast united states to meet growing demand in those areas 
during the past two years  empire and supply corporation have experienced a decline in the volumes of natural gas received at the canada united states border at the niagara river to be shipped across their systems 
the historical price advantage for gas sold at the niagara import points has declined as production in the canadian producing regions has declined or been diverted to other demand areas  and as production from new shale plays has increased in the united states 
this factor has been causing shippers to seek alternative gas supplies and consequently alternative transportation routes 
the tioga county extension project and the northern access expansion project are designed to provide an alternative gas supply source for the customers of empire and supply corporation 
these projects  which are discussed more completely in the investing cash flow section that follows  will involve significant capital expenditures 
from a capital resources perspective  the company has largely been able to meet its capital expenditure needs for all of the above projects by using cash from operations 
looking forward  the company expects to 
table of contents issue long term debt in fiscal to help meet these needs 
the company also plans to increase its use of short term debt as well 
the possibility of environmental risks associated with a well completion technology referred to as hydraulic fracturing continues to be debated 
in pennsylvania  where the company is focusing its marcellus shale development efforts  the permitting and regulatory processes seem to strike a balance between the environmental concerns associated with hydraulic fracturing and the benefits of increased natural gas production 
hydraulic fracturing is a well stimulation technique that has been used for many years  and in the company s experience  one that the company believes has little negative impact to the environment 
nonetheless  the potential for increased state or federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing could impact future costs of drilling in the marcellus shale and lead to operational delays or restrictions 
there is also the risk that drilling could be prohibited on certain acreage that is prospective for the marcellus shale 
for example  new york state had a moratorium in place that prevented hydraulic fracturing of new horizontal wells in the marcellus shale 
the moratorium ended in july and the dec has issued its recommendations for shale development and production 
however  the recommendations have not gone into effect to date 
due to the small amount of marcellus shale acreage owned by the company in new york state  the final outcome of the dec s recommendations are not expected to have a significant impact on the company s plans for marcellus shale development 
please refer to the risk factors section above for further discussion 
critical accounting estimates the company has prepared its consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information 
the following is a summary of the company s most critical accounting estimates  which are defined as those estimates whereby judgments or uncertainties could affect the application of accounting policies and materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
for a complete discussion of the company s significant accounting policies  refer to item at note a summary of significant accounting policies 
oil and gas exploration and development costs 
in the company s exploration and production segment  oil and gas property acquisition  exploration and development costs are capitalized under the full cost method of accounting 
under this accounting methodology  all costs associated with property acquisition  exploration and development activities are capitalized  including internal costs directly identified with acquisition  exploration and development activities 
the internal costs that are capitalized do not include any costs related to production  general corporate overhead  or similar activities 
the company does not recognize any gain or loss on the sale or other disposition of oil and gas properties unless the gain or loss would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil and gas attributable to a cost center 
the company believes that determining the amount of the company s proved reserves is a critical accounting estimate 
proved reserves are estimated quantities of reserves that  based on geologic and engineering data  appear with reasonable certainty to be producible under existing economic and operating conditions 
such estimates of proved reserves are inherently imprecise and may be subject to substantial revisions as a result of numerous factors including  but not limited to  additional development activity  evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 
the estimates involved in determining proved reserves are critical accounting estimates because they serve as the basis over which capitalized costs are depleted under the full cost method of accounting on a units of production basis 
unproved properties are excluded from the depletion calculation until proved reserves are found or it is determined that the unproved properties are impaired 
all costs related to unproved properties are reviewed quarterly to determine if impairment has occurred 
the amount of any impairment is transferred to the pool of capitalized costs being amortized 

table of contents in addition to depletion under the units of production method  proved reserves are a major component in the sec full cost ceiling test 
the full cost ceiling test is an impairment test prescribed by sec regulation s x rule the ceiling test  which is performed each quarter  determines a limit  or ceiling  on the amount of property acquisition  exploration and development costs that can be capitalized 
the ceiling under this test represents a the present value of estimated future net cash flows  excluding future cash outflows associated with settling asset retirement obligations that have been accrued on the balance sheet  using a discount factor of  which is computed by applying an unweighted arithmetic average of the first day of the month oil and gas prices for each month within the twelve month period prior to the end of the reporting period as adjusted for hedging to estimated future production of proved oil and gas reserves as of the date of the latest balance sheet  less estimated future expenditures  plus b the cost of unevaluated properties not being depleted  less c income tax effects related to the differences between the book and tax basis of the properties 
the estimates of future production and future expenditures are based on internal budgets that reflect planned production from current wells and expenditures necessary to sustain such future production 
the amount of the ceiling can fluctuate significantly from period to period because of additions to or subtractions from proved reserves and significant fluctuations in oil and gas prices 
the ceiling is then compared to the capitalized cost of oil and gas properties less accumulated depletion and related deferred income taxes 
if the capitalized costs of oil and gas properties less accumulated depletion and related deferred taxes exceeds the ceiling at the end of any fiscal quarter  a non cash impairment must be recorded to write down the book value of the reserves to their present value 
this non cash impairment cannot be reversed at a later date if the ceiling increases 
it should also be noted that a non cash impairment to write down the book value of the reserves to their present value in any given period causes a reduction in future depletion expense 
at september   the ceiling exceeded the book value of the company s oil and gas properties by approximately million 
the month average of the first day of the month price for crude oil for each month during  based on posted midway sunset prices  was per bbl 
the month average of the first day of the month price for natural gas for each month during  based on the quoted henry hub spot price for natural gas  was per mmbtu 
note because actual pricing of the company s various producing properties varies depending on their location and hedging  the actual various prices received for such production is utilized to calculate the ceiling  rather than the midway sunset and henry hub prices  which are only indicative of month average prices for if natural gas average prices used in the ceiling test calculation at september  had been per mmbtu lower  the ceiling would have exceeded the book value of the company s oil and gas properties by approximately million 
if crude oil average prices used in the ceiling test calculation at september  had been per bbl lower  the ceiling would have exceeded the book value of the company s oil and gas properties by approximately million 
if both natural gas and crude oil average prices used in the ceiling test calculation at september  were lower by per mmbtu and per bbl  respectively  the ceiling would have exceeded the book value of the company s oil and gas properties by approximately million 
these calculated amounts are based solely on price changes and do not take into account any other changes to the ceiling test calculation 
it is difficult to predict what factors could lead to future impairments under the sec s full cost ceiling test 
as discussed above  fluctuations in or subtractions from proved reserves and significant fluctuations in oil and gas prices have an impact on the amount of the ceiling at any point in time 
in accordance with the current authoritative guidance for asset retirement obligations  the company records an asset retirement obligation for plugging and abandonment costs associated with the exploration and production segment s crude oil and natural gas wells and capitalizes such costs in property  plant and equipment ie the full cost pool 
under the current authoritative guidance for asset retirement obligations  since plugging and abandonment costs are already included in the full cost pool  the units of production depletion calculation excludes from the depletion base any estimate of future plugging and abandonment costs that are already recorded in the full cost pool 
as discussed above  the full cost method of accounting provides a ceiling to the amount of costs that can be capitalized in the full cost pool 
in accordance with current authoritative guidance  since the full cost pool includes an amount associated with plugging and abandoning the wells  as discussed in the preceding 
table of contents paragraph  the calculation of the full cost ceiling no longer reduces the future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves by an estimate of plugging and abandonment costs 
regulation 
the company is subject to regulation by certain state and federal authorities 
the company  in its utility and pipeline and storage segments  has accounting policies which conform to the fasb authoritative guidance regarding accounting for certain types of regulations  and which are in accordance with the accounting requirements and ratemaking practices of the regulatory authorities 
the application of these accounting policies allows the company to defer expenses and income on the balance sheet as regulatory assets and liabilities when it is probable that those expenses and income will be allowed in the ratesetting process in a period different from the period in which they would have been reflected in the income statement by an unregulated company 
these deferred regulatory assets and liabilities are then flowed through the income statement in the period in which the same amounts are reflected in rates 
management s assessment of the probability of recovery or pass through of regulatory assets and liabilities requires judgment and interpretation of laws and regulatory commission orders 
if  for any reason  the company ceases to meet the criteria for application of regulatory accounting treatment for all or part of its operations  the regulatory assets and liabilities related to those portions ceasing to meet such criteria would be eliminated from the balance sheet and included in the income statement for the period in which the discontinuance of regulatory accounting treatment occurs 
such amounts would be classified as an extraordinary item 
for further discussion of the company s regulatory assets and liabilities  refer to item at note c regulatory matters 
accounting for derivative financial instruments 
the company  in its exploration and production segment  energy marketing segment  and pipeline and storage segment  uses a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage a portion of the market risk associated with fluctuations in the price of natural gas and crude oil 
these instruments are categorized as price swap agreements and futures contracts 
in accordance with the authoritative guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities  the company accounted for these instruments as effective cash flow hedges or fair value hedges 
gains or losses associated with the derivative financial instruments are matched with gains or losses resulting from the underlying physical transaction that is being hedged 
to the extent that the derivative financial instruments would ever be deemed to be ineffective based on the effectiveness testing  mark to market gains or losses from the derivative financial instruments would be recognized in the income statement without regard to an underlying physical transaction 
the company uses both exchange traded and non exchange traded derivative financial instruments 
the company adopted the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements during the quarter ended december  as such  the fair value of such derivative financial instruments is determined under the provisions of this guidance 
the fair value of exchange traded derivative financial instruments is determined from level inputs  which are quoted prices in active markets 
the company determines the fair value of non exchange traded derivative financial instruments based on an internal model  which uses both observable and unobservable inputs other than quoted prices 
these inputs are considered level or level inputs 
all derivative financial instrument assets and liabilities are evaluated for the probability of default by either the counterparty or the company 
credit reserves are applied against the fair values of such assets or liabilities 
refer to the market risk sensitive instruments section below for further discussion of the company s derivative financial instruments 
pension and other post retirement benefits 
the amounts reported in the company s financial statements related to its pension and other post retirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis  which uses many assumptions in the calculation of such amounts 
these assumptions include the discount rate  the expected return on plan assets  the rate of compensation increase and  for other post retirement benefits  the expected annual rate of increase in per capita cost of covered medical and prescription benefits 
the company utilizes a yield curve model to determine the discount rate 
the yield curve is a spot rate yield curve that provides a zero coupon interest rate for each year into the future 
each year s anticipated benefit payments are discounted at the associated spot interest rate back to the measurement date 
the discount rate is then determined based on the spot interest rate that results in the same present value when applied to the 
table of contents same anticipated benefit payments 
the expected return on plan assets assumption used by the company reflects the anticipated long term rate of return on the plan s current and future assets 
the company utilizes historical investment data  projected capital market conditions  and the plan s target asset class and investment manager allocations to set the assumption regarding the expected return on plan assets 
changes in actuarial assumptions and actuarial experience  including deviations between actual versus expected return on plan assets  could have a material impact on the amount of pension and post retirement benefit costs and funding requirements experienced by the company 
however  the company expects to recover substantially all of its net periodic pension and other post retirement benefit costs attributable to employees in its utility and pipeline and storage segments in accordance with the applicable regulatory commission authorization 
for financial reporting purposes  the difference between the amounts of pension cost and post retirement benefit cost recoverable in rates and the amounts of such costs as determined under applicable accounting principles is recorded as either a regulatory asset or liability  as appropriate  as discussed above under regulation 
pension and post retirement benefit costs for the utility and pipeline and storage segments  as determined under the authoritative guidance for pensions and postretirement benefits  represented and of the company s total pension and post retirement benefit costs for the years ended september  and  respectively 
changes in actuarial assumptions and actuarial experience could also have an impact on the benefit obligation and the funded status related to the company s pension and other post retirement benefits and could impact the company s equity 
for example  the discount rate was changed from in to in the change in the discount rate from to increased the retirement plan projected benefit obligation by million and the accumulated post retirement benefit obligation by million 
other examples include actual versus expected return on plan assets  which has an impact on the funded status of the plans  and actual versus expected benefit payments  which has an impact on the pension plan projected benefit obligation and the accumulated post retirement benefit obligation 
for  the actual versus expected return on plan assets resulted in a decrease to the funded status of the retirement plan million and the veba trusts and h accounts million 
the actual versus expected benefit payments for caused a decrease of million to the accumulated post retirement benefit obligation 
in calculating the projected benefit obligation for the retirement plan and the accumulated post retirement obligation  the actuary takes into account the average remaining service life of active participants 
the average remaining service life of active participants is years for the retirement plan and years for those eligible for other post retirement benefits 
for further discussion of the company s pension and other post retirement benefits  refer to other matters in this item  which includes a discussion of funding for the current year  and to item at note h retirement plan and other post retirement benefits 
results of operations earnings compared with the company s earnings were million in compared with earnings of million in the company had earnings from discontinued operations of million in  as discussed below  but did not have any earnings from discontinued operations in accordingly  the company s earnings from continuing operations were million in and million in the increase in earnings from continuing operations of million is primarily the result of higher earnings in the exploration and production segment and the all other category 
the utility segment also contributed to the increase in earnings 
lower earnings in the pipeline and storage segment and a higher loss in the corporate category slightly offset these increases 
in the discussion that follows  note that all amounts used in the earnings discussions are after tax amounts  unless otherwise noted 
earnings from continuing operations and discontinued operations were impacted by the following events in and event a million million after tax gain on the sale of unconsolidated subsidiaries as a result of the company s sale of its equity method investments in seneca energy and model city

the company s earnings from continuing operations were million in compared with million in the company s earnings from discontinued operations were million in compared to a loss of million in the increase in earnings from continuing operations of million is primarily the result of higher earnings in the exploration and production segment 
the utility and energy marketing segments  as well as the all other category  also contributed to the increase in earnings 
lower earnings in the pipeline and storage segment and a higher loss in the corporate category slightly offset these increases 
the increase in earnings from discontinued operations primarily resulted from the gain on the sale of the company s landfill gas operations recognized in as well as the non recurrence of million of impairment charges recognized in related to certain landfill gas assets 
earnings from continuing operations and discontinued operations were impacted by the event discussed above and several events in  including events a non cash million impairment charge million after tax recorded during the quarter ended december  for the exploration and production segment s oil and gas producing properties  a million impairment in the value of certain landfill gas assets  a million impairment in the value of the company s investment in esne recorded in the all other category  a limited liability company that owns an megawatt  combined cycle  natural gas fired power plant in the town of north east  pennsylvania  and a million death benefit gain on life insurance policies recognized in the corporate category

table of contents compared with operating revenues for the utility segment increased million in compared with this increase largely resulted from a million increase in retail gas sales revenues  a million increase in transportation revenues  and a million increase in off system sales revenue 
these were partially offset by a million decrease in other operating revenues 
the increase in retail gas sales revenues of million was largely a function of higher volumes bcf due to colder weather and higher customer usage per account 
the increase in volumes resulted in the recovery of a larger amount of gas costs  despite a decline in the utility segment s average cost of purchased gas 
subject to certain timing variations  gas costs are recovered dollar for dollar in revenues 
see further discussion of purchased gas below under the heading purchased gas 
the increase in transportation revenues of million was primarily due to a bcf increase in transportation throughput  largely the result of colder weather and the migration of customers from retail sales to transportation service 
the increase in off system sales revenues was largely due to an increase in off system sales volume 
due to profit sharing with retail customers  the margins resulting from off system sales are minimal and there was not a material impact to margins 
the million decrease in other operating revenues was largely attributable to an adjustment to the carrying value of certain regulatory asset accounts to a level the company believes will ultimately be recovered in the rate setting process 
compared with operating revenues for the utility segment decreased million in compared with this decrease largely resulted from a million decrease in retail gas sales revenues  a million decrease in transportation revenues  and a million decrease in other operating revenues 
these were partially offset by a million increase in off system sales revenue 
the decrease in retail gas sales revenues of million was largely a function of warmer weather and lower gas costs subject to certain timing variations  gas costs are recovered dollar for dollar in revenues 
the recovery of lower gas costs resulted from a lower cost of purchased gas combined with the refunding of previously over recovered purchased gas costs 
see further discussion of purchased gas below under the heading purchased gas 
the increase in off system sales revenues of million was largely due to the utility segment not engaging in off system sales from november through october this was due to order no 
final rule  which was issued by the ferc on october  the final rule seemingly held that a local distribution company making off system sales on unaffiliated pipelines would be engaging in marketing that would require distribution corporation to substantially modify its operations in order to assure compliance with the ferc s standards of conduct 
accordingly  pending clarification of this issue from the ferc  as of november   distribution corporation ceased off system sales activities 
on october   the ferc released order no 
a  which clarified that a local distribution company making off system sales of gas that has been transported on non affiliated pipelines is not subject to the ferc standards of conduct 
in light of and in reliance on this clarification  distribution corporation determined that it could resume engaging in off system sales on non affiliated pipelines 
such off system sales resumed in november due to profit sharing with retail customers  the margins resulting from off system sales are minimal and there was not a material impact to earnings 
the decrease in transportation revenues of million was primarily due to warmer weather and the resulting decrease in transportation volumes for residential and commercial customers 
while there was a slight increase in transportation volumes of bcf for all revenue classes  this was largely due to an increase in throughput for large industrial customers 
throughput variations associated with large industrial customers do not have a significant impact on transportation revenues 
the decrease in other operating revenues of million is largely due to a decrease in late payment revenue  caused by a decrease in gas costs 

table of contents purchased gas the cost of purchased gas is the company s single largest operating expense 
annual variations in purchased gas costs are attributed directly to changes in gas sales volumes  the price of gas purchased and the operation of purchased gas adjustment clauses 
distribution corporation recorded million  million and million of purchased gas expense during  and  respectively 
under its purchased gas adjustment clauses in new york and pennsylvania  distribution corporation is not allowed to profit from fluctuations in gas costs 
purchased gas expense recorded on the consolidated income statement matches the revenues collected from customers  a component of operating revenues on the consolidated income statement 
under mechanisms approved by the nypsc in new york and the papuc in pennsylvania  any difference between actual purchased gas costs and what has been collected from the customer is deferred on the consolidated balance sheet as either an asset  unrecovered purchased gas costs  or a liability  amounts payable to customers 
these deferrals are subsequently collected from the customer or passed back to the customer  subject to review by the nypsc and the papuc 
absent disallowance of full recovery of distribution corporation s purchased gas costs  such costs do not impact the profitability of the company 
purchased gas costs impact cash flow from operations due to the timing of recovery of such costs versus the actual purchased gas costs incurred during a particular period 
distribution corporation s purchased gas adjustment clauses seek to mitigate this impact by adjusting revenues on either a quarterly or monthly basis 
currently  distribution corporation has contracted for long term firm transportation capacity with supply corporation  empire and seven other upstream pipeline companies  for long term gas supplies with a combination of producers and marketers  and for storage service with supply corporation and two nonaffiliated companies 
in addition  distribution corporation satisfies a portion of its gas requirements through spot market purchases 
changes in wellhead prices have a direct impact on the cost of purchased gas 
distribution corporation s average cost of purchased gas  including the cost of transportation and storage  was per mcf in  a decrease of from the average cost of per mcf in the average cost of purchased gas in was lower than the average cost of per mcf in additional discussion of the utility segment s gas purchases appears under the heading sources and availability of raw materials in item earnings compared with the utility segment s earnings in were million  an increase of million when compared with earnings of million in the increase in earnings is largely attributable to colder weather million and higher usage per account million in pennsylvania 
the phrase usage per account refers to average gas consumption per account after factoring out any impact that weather may have had on consumption 
in addition  earnings were positively impacted by lower interest expense on deferred gas costs million and lower operating expenses million due to decreased bad debt expense and personnel costs partially offset by higher pension expense 
these increases were partially offset by various regulatory adjustments million  primarily due to an adjustment to the carrying value of certain regulatory asset accounts to a level the company believes will ultimately be recovered in the rate setting process  an increase in other taxes million  higher income tax expense million and higher depreciation expense million 
the impact of weather on the utility segment s new york rate jurisdiction is tempered by a weather normalization clause wnc 
the wnc  which covers the eight month period from october through may  has had a stabilizing effect on earnings for the new york rate jurisdiction 
in addition  in periods of colder than normal weather  the wnc benefits the utility segment s new york customers 
for  the wnc reduced earnings by approximately million  as the weather was colder than normal 
for  the wnc preserved earnings of approximately million  as the weather was warmer than normal 

table of contents compared with the utility segment s earnings in were million  an increase of million when compared with earnings of million in the increase in earnings was primarily due to the positive earnings impact associated with a lower effective tax rate million  lower operating expenses million and routine regulatory adjustments million 
the effective tax rate impact is attributable to a lower state income tax expense in as a result of the pass back to customers of over collected gas costs 
the decrease in operating expenses was mainly due to a decrease in bad debt expense slightly offset by an increase in personnel costs 
these factors were partially offset by lower usage per account in pennsylvania million  higher interest expense million  lower late payment revenue due to lower gas costs million and warmer weather in pennsylvania million 
the increase in interest expense was partially due to the company s april debt issuance that was issued at a significantly higher interest rate than the debt that had matured in march in addition  accrued interest on deferred gas costs increased as a result of the over recovery of gas costs during fiscal for  the wnc preserved earnings of approximately million  as the weather was warmer than normal 
for  the wnc reduced earnings by approximately million  as the weather was colder than normal 
pipeline and storage revenues pipeline and storage operating revenues year ended september thousands firm transportation interruptible transportation firm storage service interruptible storage service other pipeline and storage throughput mmcf year ended september firm transportation interruptible transportation compared with operating revenues for the pipeline and storage segment decreased million in as compared with the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in transportation revenues of million 
the decrease in transportation revenues was primarily the result of a reduction in the level of contracts entered into by shippers year over year as shippers utilized lower priced pipeline transportation routes 
shippers 
table of contents continue to seek alternative lower priced gas supply and in some cases  do not renew short term transportation contracts because of the relatively higher price of natural gas supplies available at the united states canadian border at the niagara river near buffalo  new york compared to the lower pricing for supplies available at leidy  pennsylvania 
empire s tioga county extension project and supply corporation s northern access expansion project  both of which are discussed in the investing cash flow section that follows  are designed to utilize that available pipeline capacity by receiving natural gas produced from the marcellus shale and transporting it to canada and the northeast united states where demand has been growing 
the decrease was partially offset by an increase in efficiency gas revenues of million reported as a part of other revenue in the table above due to higher efficiency gas volumes partially offset by lower gas prices 
under supply corporation s tariff with shippers  supply corporation is allowed to retain a set percentage of shipper supplied gas as compressor fuel and for other operational purposes 
to the extent that supply corporation does not need all of the gas to cover such operational needs  it is allowed to keep the excess gas as inventory 
that inventory is later sold to buyers on the open market 
the excess gas that is retained as inventory  as well as any gains resulting from the sale of such inventory  represent efficiency gas revenue to supply corporation 
also offsetting the decrease in revenues was an increase in cashout revenues of million reported as a part of other revenue in the table above 
cashout revenues are completely offset by purchased gas expense and as a result have no impact on earnings 
volume fluctuations generally do not have a significant impact on revenues as a result of the straight fixed variable rate design utilized by supply corporation and empire  but this rate design does not protect supply corporation or empire in situations where shippers do not contract for that capacity at the same quantity and rate 
in that situation  supply corporation or empire can propose revised rates and services in a rate case at the ferc 
transportation volume increased by bcf in as compared with while transportation volume increased largely due to colder weather  there was little impact on revenues due to the straight fixed variable rate design 
compared with operating revenues for the pipeline and storage segment decreased million in as compared with the decrease was due to a decrease in interruptible transportation revenues of million largely due to a decrease in the gathering rate under supply corporation s tariff 
also contributing to the decrease was a decrease in cashout revenues of million 
offsetting the decrease was an increase in efficiency gas revenues of million due to higher efficiency gas volumes and a significantly lower efficiency gas inventory write down in versus these increases to efficiency gas revenues were partially offset by lower gas prices and a lower gain  period over period  on the sale of retained efficiency gas volumes held in inventory 
also offsetting the decrease in revenues was an increase in firm transportation revenues of million 
this increase was primarily the result of higher revenues from the empire connector  which was placed in service in december  partially offset by a reduction in the level of short term contracts entered into by shippers period over period as such shippers utilized lower priced pipeline transportation routes 
transportation volume decreased by bcf in as compared with these decreases were largely due to shippers seeking alternative lower priced gas supply and in some cases  not renewing short term transportation contracts combined with warmer weather and lower industrial demand 
as discussed above  volume fluctuations generally do not have a significant impact on revenues as a result of the straight fixed variable rate design 
earnings compared with the pipeline and storage segment s earnings in were million  a decrease of million when compared with earnings of million in the decrease in earnings is primarily due to the earnings impact of higher operating expenses million  lower transportation revenues of million  
table of contents as discussed above  higher depreciation expense million and higher property taxes million 
the increase in operating expenses can be attributed primarily to higher pension expense million  higher compressor maintenance costs million  higher personnel costs million and the write off of expired and unused storage rights million 
the increase in property taxes is primarily a result of a higher tax base due to capital additions combined with higher pennsylvania public utility realty taxes 
the increase in depreciation expense is primarily the result of a revision during fiscal to correct accumulated depreciation as well as additional projects that were placed in service in the last year 
these earnings decreases were partially offset by an increase in the allowance for funds used during construction equity component of million primarily due to construction commencing during the current year on supply corporation s line n expansion project and lamont phase ii project and empire s tioga county extension project  as discussed in the investing cash flow section that follows  and by the earnings impact associated with higher efficiency gas revenues million  as discussed above 
compared with the pipeline and storage segment s earnings in were million  a decrease of million when compared with earnings of million in the decrease in earnings is primarily due to a decrease in the allowance for funds used during construction million  higher operating costs million  higher property taxes million  higher interest expense million and higher depreciation expense million 
lower transportation revenues of million  as discussed above  also contributed to the earnings decrease 
the decrease in allowance for funds used during construction equity component is a result of the construction of the empire connector  which was completed and placed in service on december  the increase in operating expenses can primarily be attributed to higher pension expense  higher personnel costs  and an increase in corrosion logging expenses associated with supply corporation s storage wells 
the increase in property taxes is primarily a result of additional property taxes and higher payments in lieu of taxes associated with the empire connector 
the increase in interest expense can be attributed to higher debt balances and a higher average interest rate on borrowings combined with a decrease in the allowance for borrowed funds used during construction resulting from the completion of the empire connector 
the increase in the average interest rate stems from the company s april debt issuance 
the increase in depreciation expense is primarily the result of the empire connector being placed in service in december these earnings decreases were partially offset by the earnings impact associated with higher efficiency gas revenues million  as discussed above  and lower income tax expense million due to a lower effective tax rate

earnings compared with the exploration and production segment s earnings for were million  compared with earnings of million for  an increase of million 
higher natural gas production and higher crude oil prices increased earnings by million and million  respectively 
higher processing plant revenues million further contributed to an increase in earnings 
lower interest expense million due to a lower average amount of debt further contributed to an increase in earnings 
lower natural gas prices million and lower crude oil production million partially offset the increase in earnings 
in addition  earnings were further reduced by higher depletion expense million  higher general  administrative and other operating expenses million  higher lease operating expenses million  higher income tax expense million  and higher property and other taxes million 
the increase in depletion expense is primarily due to an increase in production and depletable base largely due to increased capital spending in the appalachian region  specifically related to the development of marcellus shale properties 
the increase in lease operating expenses is largely attributable to a higher number of producing properties in appalachia 
higher personnel costs are largely responsible for the increase in general  administrative and other operating expenses 
higher property and other taxes are attributable to a revision of the california property tax liability  which was partially offset by a decrease in property and other taxes as a result of the sale of the gulf coast s off shore properties in april the increase in income tax expense is attributable to higher state income taxes coupled with the loss of a domestic production activities deduction that occurred during the quarter ended september  and its impact on the effective tax rate during fiscal the decrease in interest and other income is largely attributable to lower cash investment balances in as compared to compared with the exploration and production segment s earnings for were million  compared with a loss of million for  an increase of million

higher processing plant revenues million largely due to an increase in commodity prices of residual gas and liquids sold at seneca s processing plants in the west coast region further contributed to an increase in earnings 
lower interest expense million due to a lower average amount of debt outstanding and the capitalization of interest further contributed to an increase 
table of contents in earnings 
in addition  lower general and administrative and other operating expenses million increased earnings 
the decrease in general and administrative and other operating expenses primarily reflects variations between actual plugging and abandonment costs incurred versus amounts previously accrued for such properties 
during  actual plugging and abandonment costs incurred were less than the liability that had been established for such properties  resulting in a gain 
the decrease in general and administrative and other operating expenses also reflects a decrease in bad debt expense 
higher personnel costs  primarily in the appalachian region  partially offset these decreases 
lower natural gas prices million and lower crude oil production million partially offset the increase in earnings 
in addition  the earnings increases noted above were partially offset by higher depletion expense million  the earnings impact associated with higher income tax expense million  higher lease operating expenses million  and lower interest income million 
the increase in depletion expense was primarily due to an increase in production and depletable base largely due to increased capital spending in the appalachian region 
the increase in income tax expense in is attributable to the loss of a domestic production activities deduction for fiscal  the non recurrence of a corporate tax benefit received in the prior year  and higher state income taxes 
lease operating expenses increased due to higher steaming costs in california  additional production properties related to the acquisition of ivanhoe energy s united states oil and gas properties in july  an increase in the costs associated with a higher number of producing properties in the appalachian region  primarily within the marcellus shale  and higher production taxes 
the reduction in interest income was largely due to lower interest rates on cash investment balances 
energy marketing revenues energy marketing operating revenues year ended september thousands natural gas after hedging other energy marketing volume year ended september natural gas mmcf compared with operating revenues for the energy marketing segment decreased million in as compared with the decrease primarily reflects a decline in gas sales revenue due largely to a decrease in volume sold as well as a lower average price of natural gas that was recovered through revenues 
the decrease in volume is largely attributable to the non recurrence of sales transactions undertaken at the niagara pipeline delivery point to offset certain basis risks that the energy marketing segment was exposed to under certain fixed basis commodity purchase contracts for appalachian production 
the decrease in volume also reflects a decrease in volume sold to low margin wholesale customers 
such transactions had the effect of increasing revenue and volume sold with minimal impact to earnings 
the decrease in volume sold to wholesale customers was partially offset by an increase in volume sold to retail customers 
compared with operating revenues for the energy marketing segment decreased million in as compared with the decrease primarily reflects a decline in gas sales revenue due to a lower average price of 
table of contents natural gas that was recovered through revenues  as well as a decrease in volume sold 
the decrease in volume is largely attributable to a decrease in volume sold to low margin wholesale customers as well as fewer sales transactions undertaken at the niagara pipeline delivery point to offset certain basis risks that the energy marketing segment was exposed to under certain fixed basis commodity purchase contracts for appalachian production 
such transactions had the effect of increasing revenue and volume sold with minimal impact to earnings 
earnings compared with the energy marketing segment s earnings were million in both and a decrease in margin of million was offset by the positive impact of lower income tax expense million and lower operating costs million 
the decrease in margin was due to a lower benefit that the energy marketing segment derived from its contracts for storage capacity and the non recurrence of proceeds received in as a member of a class of claimants in a class action litigation settlement  offset somewhat by higher volume sold to retail customers 
compared with the energy marketing segment s earnings in were million  an increase of million when compared with earnings of million in this increase was primarily attributable to higher margin of million combined with lower income tax expense of million 
the increase in margin was primarily driven by improved average margins per mcf  the benefit that the energy marketing segment derived from its contracts for storage capacity  and proceeds received as a member of a class of claimants in a class action litigation settlement 
higher operating costs of million slightly offset the increase in earnings 
the increase in operating expenses was primarily due to a june accrual for us customs merchandise processing fees that may be due for certain past gas imports from canada  largely offset by lower bad debt expense 
all other and corporate operations all other and corporate operations primarily includes the operations of seneca s northeast division  highland which was merged into seneca s northeast division in june  midstream corporation  horizon power and corporate operations 
seneca s northeast division markets timber from its new york and pennsylvania land holdings 
in september  the company sold its sawmill in marienville  pennsylvania along with the mill s inventory  stumpage tracts and certain land and timber acreage for approximately million 
the company recognized a gain of approximately million from this sale million after tax 
the company continues to maintain a forestry operation  but will no longer be processing lumber products 
midstream corporation is a pennsylvania corporation formed to build  own and operate natural gas processing and pipeline gathering facilities in the appalachian region 
horizon power s current activity primarily consists of a equity method investment in esne 
on november   esne stopped all electricity generation operations 
the turbines and other assets are in the process of being sold and or dismantled 
esne generated electricity from an megawatt  combined cycle  natural gas fired power plant in north east  pennsylvania 
in february  horizon power sold its equity method investments in seneca energy and model city for million 
seneca energy and model city generate and sell electricity using methane gas obtained from landfills owned by outside parties 
the sale is the result of the company s strategy to pursue the sale of smaller  non core assets in order to focus on its core businesses  including the development of the marcellus shale and the expansion of its pipeline business throughout the appalachian region 
the company reports income from its equity method investments as income from unconsolidated subsidiaries on the consolidated statements of income

refer to item at note j discontinued operations for further details 
earnings compared with all other and corporate operations had income from continuing operations of million in compared with a loss from continuing operations of million in the overall increase in earnings from continuing operations is due to the gain on the sale of horizon power s investments in seneca energy and model city of million  lower interest expense of million primarily the result of lower borrowings at a lower interest rate due to the repayment of million of notes that matured in november  higher gathering and processing revenues of million due to an increase in midstream corporation s gathering and processing revenues and lower depreciation and depletion expense of million due to a decrease in timber harvested as a result of the sale of the company s timber harvesting and milling operations in september 
lower income tax expense million further contributed to the earnings increase 
the factors contributing to the overall increase in earnings were partially offset by lower interest income of million due to lower interest collected from the company s exploration and production segment as a result of the aforementioned november debt repayment  lower margins of million due to a decrease in timber harvested as a result of the sale of the company s timber harvesting and milling operations in september  higher property  franchise and other taxes of million due to an increase in capital stock expense recorded during the year ended september  related to fiscal year and higher operating expenses of million mostly due to an increase in midstream corporation s operating activities 
additionally  the company recorded a loss from unconsolidated subsidiaries of million during the year ended september  compared to income of million during the year ended september  the change in income loss from unconsolidated subsidiaries reflects the sale of seneca energy and model city combined with the dormancy of esne 
compared with all other and corporate operations had a loss from continuing operations of million in compared with earnings from continuing operations of million in the overall decrease was due to higher interest expense of million primarily the result of higher borrowings at a higher interest rate due to the million of notes issued in april  higher income tax expense of million due to a higher effective tax rate  higher depreciation and depletion expense of million mostly attributable to increased depletion expense due to an increase in timber harvested from company owned lands  and higher operating expenses of million mostly attributable to an increase in midstream corporation s operating activities 
in addition  the non recurrence of a gain resulting from a death benefit on corporate owned life insurance policies held by the company of million that occurred during the quarter ended december  further reduced earnings 
the negative earnings impact associated with items mentioned above were partially offset by higher margins of million and higher interest income of million 
the increase in margins was mostly attributable to higher margins from log and lumber sales partially due to the increase in timber harvested from low cost basis  company owned lands coupled with higher revenues from midstream corporation s gathering operations 
the increase in interest income was due to higher intercompany interest collected from the company s other operating segments as a result of the allocation of the aforementioned april debt issuance 
in addition  during the quarter ended december   esne  an unconsolidated subsidiary of horizon power  recorded an impairment charge of million  which did not recur 
horizon power s share of the impairment was million million on an after tax basis 
interest income interest income was million lower in as compared to lower cash investment balances and interest rates on these balances was the primary factor contributing to this decrease 

table of contents interest income was million lower in as compared to lower interest rates on cash investment balances was the primary factor contributing to this decrease 
other income other income was million higher in as compared to this increase is attributable to a million gain on corporate owned life insurance policies recognized during the second quarter of fiscal and a million gain on the sale of horizon energy development recognized during the first quarter of fiscal in addition  there was a million increase in allowance for funds used during construction in the pipeline and storage segment as well as a million gain resulting from the auction of some remaining timber mill equipment during other income was million lower in as compared to this decrease is attributable to a million decrease in the allowance for funds used during construction  which is primarily due to the completion of the empire connector project in december in addition  a death benefit gain on corporate owned life insurance policies of million recognized during the first quarter of did not recur in interest charges although most of the variances in interest charges are discussed in the earnings discussion by segment above  the following is a summary on a consolidated basis interest on long term debt decreased million in as compared to this decrease is primarily the result of a lower average amount of long term debt outstanding and slightly lower average interest rates 
the company repaid million of notes that matured in november in addition  there was an increase in capitalized interest associated with increased capital expenditures in the marcellus shale area of the appalachian region  which decreased interest expense by million in comparison to prior year 
interest on long term debt increased million in as compared to the increase in was primarily the result of a higher average amount of long term debt outstanding combined with higher average interest rates 
in april  the company issued million of senior  unsecured notes due in may this increase was partially offset by the repayment of million of medium term notes that matured in march in addition  during fiscal  the exploration and production segment significantly increased its capital expenditures related to unproved properties in the marcellus shale area of the appalachian region 
as a result  the company capitalized interest costs associated with capital expenditures  which decreased interest expense by million 
other interest charges decreased million in compared to the decrease is mainly attributable to a million decrease in interest expense on regulatory deferrals primarily deferred gas costs in the utility segment  and a million increase in the allowance for borrowed funds used during construction resulting from current expansion projects in the pipeline and storage segment 
other interest charges decreased million in compared to the decrease is mainly attributable to a million decrease in interest expense on regulatory deferrals primarily deferred gas costs in the utility segment  which was partially offset by a million decrease in the allowance for borrowed funds used during construction resulting from the completion of the empire connector in december

non cash items include depreciation  depletion and amortization  impairment of oil and gas producing properties  impairment of investment in partnership  deferred income taxes and income or loss from unconsolidated subsidiaries net of cash distributions 
net income available for common stock is also adjusted for the gain on sale of unconsolidated subsidiaries and the gain on sale of discontinued operations 
cash provided by operating activities in the utility and pipeline and storage segments may vary substantially from year to year because of the impact of rate cases 
in the utility segment  supplier refunds  over or under recovered purchased gas costs and weather may also significantly impact cash flow 
the impact of weather on cash flow is tempered in the utility segment s new york rate jurisdiction by its wnc and in the pipeline and storage segment by the straight fixed variable rate design used by supply corporation and empire 
cash provided by operating activities in the exploration and production segment may vary from period to period as a result of changes in the commodity prices of natural gas and crude oil as well as changes in production 
the company uses various derivative financial instruments  including price swap agreements and futures contracts in an attempt to manage this energy commodity price risk 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled million in  an increase of million compared with the million provided by operating activities in the increase is primarily due to higher cash receipts from the sale of natural gas production in the exploration and production segment 
from a consolidated perspective  the company s cash provided by operating activities also increased during due to income tax refunds received during the year as compared to income taxes paid during 
table of contents net cash provided by operating activities totaled million in  a decrease of million compared with the million provided by operating activities in the decrease is primarily due to the timing of gas cost recovery in the utility segment 
as gas prices decreased significantly during  the company s utility segment experienced an over recovery of gas costs that was reflected in amounts payable to customers on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
since september   the company has been refunding that over recovery to its customers 
from a consolidated perspective  higher interest payments on long term debt also contributed to the decrease in cash provided by operating activities

table of contents estimated capital expenditures the company s estimated capital expenditures for the next three years are year ended september millions utility pipeline and storage exploration and production all other includes estimated expenditures for the years ended september   and of approximately million  million and million  respectively  to develop proved undeveloped reserves 
the company is committed to developing its proved undeveloped reserves within five years as required by the sec s final rule on modernization of oil and gas reporting 
utility estimated capital expenditures for the utility segment in will be concentrated in the areas of main and service line improvements and replacements and  to a lesser extent  the purchase of new equipment 
pipeline and storage estimated capital expenditures for the pipeline and storage segment in will be concentrated on the construction of new pipeline and compressor stations to support expansion projects  the replacement of transmission and storage lines  the reconditioning of storage wells and improvements of compressor stations 
in light of the growing demand for pipeline capacity to move natural gas from new wells being drilled in appalachia specifically in the marcellus shale producing area supply corporation and empire are actively pursuing several expansion projects and paying for preliminary survey and investigation costs  which are initially recorded as deferred charges on the consolidated balance sheet 
an offsetting reserve is established as those preliminary survey and investigation costs are incurred  which reduces the deferred charges balance and increases operation and maintenance expense on the consolidated statement of income 
the company reviews all projects on a quarterly basis  and if it is determined that it is highly probable that the project will be built  the reserve is reversed 
this reversal reduces operation and maintenance expense and reestablishes the original balance in deferred charges 
after the reversal of the reserve  the amounts remain in deferred charges until such time as capital expenditures for the project have been incurred and activities that are necessary to get the construction project ready for its intended use are in progress 
at that point  the balance is transferred from deferred charges to construction work in progress  a component of property  plant and equipment on the consolidated balance sheet 
as of september   the total amount reserved for the pipeline and storage segment s preliminary survey and investigation costs was million 
supply corporation and empire are moving forward with several projects designed to move anticipated marcellus production gas to other interstate pipelines and to markets beyond the supply corporation and empire pipeline systems 
supply corporation has signed a precedent agreement to provide  dth day of firm transportation capacity in conjunction with its northern access expansion project 
upon satisfaction of the conditions in the precedent agreement  statoil natural gas llc statoil will enter into a year firm transportation agreement for  dth day 
this capacity will provide statoil with a firm transportation path from the tennessee gas pipeline tgp line at ellisburg to the transcanada pipeline at niagara 
this path is attractive because it provides a route for marcellus shale gas  principally along the tgp line in northern 
table of contents pennsylvania  to be transported from the marcellus supply basin to northern markets 
supply corporation filed an application for ferc authorization of the project on march   and received its certificate on october  the project facilities involve approximately  horsepower of additional compression at supply corporation s existing ellisburg station and a new approximately  horsepower compressor station in east aurora  new york  along with other system enhancements including enhancements to the jointly owned niagara spur loop line 
service is expected to begin in november the cost estimate for the northern access expansion is million  all of which is expected to be spent in fiscal and  except for approximately million already spent through september  these expenditures are included as pipeline and storage segment estimated capital expenditures in the table above 
the million spent has been capitalized as construction work in progress 
another expansion project involves new compression along supply corporation s line n line n expansion project  increasing that line s capacity by  dth day into texas eastern s holbrook station tetco holbrook in southwestern pennsylvania 
the project will allow marcellus production located in the vicinity of line n to flow south and access markets off texas eastern s system 
two service agreements totaling  dth day of firm transportation have been executed 
the ferc issued the nga section c certificate on december   and the project was placed into service on october  the cost estimate for the line n expansion project is million 
as of september   approximately million has been spent on the line n expansion project  all of which has been capitalized as construction work in progress 
supply corporation has also executed a precedent agreement for  dth day of additional capacity on line n to tetco holbrook and has designed a project for this shipper to be ready for service beginning november line n expansion project 
on july   supply corporation filed for ferc authorization to construct the line n expansion project which consists of an additional  horsepower of compression at its buffalo compressor station  and the replacement of miles of pipe with pipe  to enhance the integrity and reliability of its system and to create the additional capacity 
the preliminary cost estimate for the line n expansion project is approximately million for the incremental capacity plus approximately million allocated to system replacement 
these amounts are expected to be spent in fiscal  except for approximately million already spent through september  these expenditures are included as pipeline and storage segment estimated capital expenditures in the table above 
the company has determined that it is highly probable that this project will be built 
accordingly  previous reserves have been reversed and the project costs have been capitalized as construction work in progress 
following up on supply corporation s lamont project which went into service on june   a second lamont expansion lamont phase ii project has been fully subscribed and is now in service 
supply corporation has two executed service agreements for the full capacity of this project 
with the addition of  horsepower of compression at lamont   dth day of incremental firm capacity was placed in service on july   and an additional  dth day commenced on october  as of september   approximately million has been spent on the lamont phase ii project  all of which has been capitalized 
in addition  supply corporation continues to actively pursue its largest planned expansion  the west to east we pipeline project  which is designed to transport locally produced marcellus natural gas supplies to the ellisburg leidy corning area 
supply corporation anticipates that the development of the we project will occur in phases 
as currently envisioned  the initial phases of we  referred to as the we overbeck to leidy project  are designed to transport at least  dth day  and involves construction of a new mile pipeline through elk  cameron  clinton  clearfield and jefferson counties to the leidy hub  from marcellus and other producing areas along over miles of supply corporation s existing pipeline system 
the we overbeck to leidy project also includes a total of approximately  horsepower of compression at two separate stations 
the project may be built in phases depending on the development of marcellus production along the corridor  with the first facilities expected to go in service in late or late 
table of contents following an open season that concluded on october   supply corporation executed precedent agreements to provide  dth day of firm transportation on the we overbeck to leidy project 
supply corporation is pursuing post open season capacity requests for the remaining capacity 
on march   the ferc granted supply corporation s request for a pre filing environmental review of the we overbeck to leidy project  and supply corporation is in the process of preparing an nga section c application 
the capital cost of the we overbeck to leidy project is estimated to be million  approximately million of which is expected to be spent during the period of fiscal through these expenditures are included as pipeline and storage segment estimated capital expenditures in the table above 
as of september   approximately million has been spent to study the we overbeck to leidy project  which has been included in preliminary survey and investigation charges and has been fully reserved for at september  empire has executed service agreements for all  dth day of incremental firm transportation capacity in its tioga county extension project 
this project will transport marcellus production from new interconnections at the southern terminus of a mile extension of its empire connector line  in tioga county  pennsylvania 
empire s cost estimate for the tioga county extension project is approximately million  of which approximately million has been spent through september  and has been capitalized as construction work in progress 
the remainder is expected to be spent in fiscal and is included as pipeline and storage segment estimated capital expenditures in the table above 
this project will enable shippers to deliver their natural gas at existing empire interconnections with millennium pipeline at corning  new york  with the transcanada pipeline at the niagara river at chippawa  and with utility and power generation markets along its path  as well as to a planned new interconnection with tgp s line zone in ontario county  new york 
on august   empire filed an nga section c application to the ferc for approval of the project and the ferc issued the certificate on may  empire has accepted the certificate  received a ferc notice to proceed and on july  commenced construction 
these facilities were placed fully in service on november  on december   empire concluded an open season for up to  dth day of additional capacity from tioga county  pennsylvania  to transcanada pipeline and the tgp line  as well as additional short haul capacity to millennium pipeline at corning central tioga county extension 
empire is evaluating the substantial market interest resulting from this open season  which was for more than  dth day of capacity  and is studying the facility design that would be necessary to provide the requested service 
the central tioga county extension project may involve up to  horsepower of compression at up to three new stations and a mile pipeline extension  at a preliminary cost estimate of million 
these expenditures are included as pipeline and storage segment estimated capital expenditures in the table above 
as of september   approximately million has been spent to study the central tioga county extension project  which has been included in preliminary survey and investigation charges and has been fully reserved for at september  the company has largely been financing the line n expansion projects  the lamont phase ii project  the northern access expansion project  the we overbeck to leidy project  and the tioga county extension projects  all of which are discussed above  with cash from operations 
going forward  while the company expects to use cash from operations as the first means of financing these projects  it is expected that the company will increase its use of short term borrowings in fiscal the company also plans to issue additional long term debt in fiscal exploration and production estimated capital expenditures in for the exploration and production segment include approximately million for the appalachian region and million for the west coast region 
the company anticipates drilling to net horizontal wells in the marcellus shale during estimated capital expenditures in for the exploration and production segment include approximately million for the appalachian region and million for the west coast region 
the company anticipates drilling to net horizontal wells in the marcellus shale during 
table of contents estimated capital expenditures in for the exploration and production segment include approximately million for the appalachian region and million for the west coast region 
the company anticipates drilling to net horizontal wells in the marcellus shale during it is anticipated that these future capital expenditures will be funded with a combination of cash from operations  short term borrowings  and long term debt 
natural gas and crude oil prices combined with production from existing wells will be a significant factor in determining how much of the capital expenditures are funded from cash from operations 
while the company expects to use cash from operations as the first means of financing these expenditures  it is expected that the company will increase its use of short term borrowings in fiscal the company also plans to issue additional long term debt in fiscal all other and corporate estimated capital expenditures in for the all other and corporate category will primarily be for the construction of anticipated gathering systems  including completing the construction of midstream corporation s trout run gathering system  as discussed above  and construction of midstream corporation s mt 
jewett and owls nest gathering systems  discussed below 
midstream corporation is planning to construct a gathering system in mckean county  pennsylvania 
the project  called the mt 
jewett gathering system  is anticipated to be placed in service in june the gathering system will cost approximately million 
these expenditures are included as all other category estimated capital expenditures in the table above 
as of september   the company has not incurred any costs related to this project 
midstream corporation is also planning to construct a gathering system in elk county  pennsylvania 
the project  called the owls nest gathering system  is anticipated to be placed in service in april the gathering system will cost approximately million 
these expenditures are included as all other category estimated capital expenditures in the table above 
as of september   the company has not incurred any costs related to this project 
the company anticipates funding the midstream corporation projects with cash from operations  short term borrowings  and long term debt 
while the company expects to use cash from operations as the first means of financing these projects  it is expected that the company will increase its use of short term borrowings in fiscal the company also plans to issue additional long term debt in fiscal the company continuously evaluates capital expenditures and investments in corporations  partnerships  and other business entities 
the amounts are subject to modification for opportunities such as the acquisition of attractive oil and gas properties  natural gas storage facilities and the expansion of natural gas transmission line capacities 
while the majority of capital expenditures in the utility segment are necessitated by the continued need for replacement and upgrading of mains and service lines  the magnitude of future capital expenditures or other investments in the company s other business segments depends  to a large degree  upon market conditions 
financing cash flow consolidated short term debt increased million during the year ended september  and did not exceed million outstanding during the year 
the company continues to consider short term debt consisting of short term notes payable to banks and commercial paper an important source of cash for temporarily financing capital expenditures and investments in corporations and or partnerships  gas in storage inventory  unrecovered purchased gas costs  margin calls on derivative financial instruments  exploration and development expenditures  repurchases of stock  and other working capital needs 
fluctuations in these items can have a significant impact on the amount and timing of short term debt 
at september   the company had outstanding commercial paper of million and no outstanding short term notes payable to banks 

table of contents as for bank loans  the company maintains a number of individual uncommitted or discretionary lines of credit with certain financial institutions for general corporate purposes 
borrowings under these lines of credit are made at competitive market rates 
these credit lines  which aggregate to million  are revocable at the option of the financial institutions and are reviewed on an annual basis 
the company anticipates that these lines of credit will continue to be renewed  or substantially replaced by similar lines 
the total amount available to be issued under the company s commercial paper program is million 
the commercial paper program is backed by a syndicated committed credit facility totaling million  which commitment extends through september  under the company s committed credit facility  the company has agreed that its debt to capitalization ratio will not exceed 
at the last day of any fiscal quarter through september  at september   the company s debt to capitalization ratio as calculated under the facility was 
the constraints specified in the committed credit facility would permit an additional billion in short term and or long term debt to be outstanding further limited by the indenture covenants discussed below before the company s debt to capitalization ratio would exceed 
if a downgrade in any of the company s credit ratings were to occur  access to the commercial paper markets might not be possible 
however  the company expects that it could borrow under its committed credit facility  uncommitted bank lines of credit or rely upon other liquidity sources  including cash provided by operations 
under the company s existing indenture covenants  at september   the company would have been permitted to issue up to a maximum of billion in additional long term unsecured indebtedness at then current market interest rates in addition to being able to issue new indebtedness to replace maturing debt 
the company s present liquidity position is believed to be adequate to satisfy known demands 
however  if the company were to experience a significant loss in the future for example  as a result of an impairment of oil and gas properties  it is possible  depending on factors including the magnitude of the loss  that these indenture covenants would restrict the company s ability to issue additional long term unsecured indebtedness for a period of up to nine calendar months  beginning with the fourth calendar month following the loss 
this would not at any time preclude the company from issuing new indebtedness to replace maturing debt 
the company s indenture pursuant to which million or of the company s long term debt as of september  was issued  contains a cross default provision whereby the failure by the company to perform certain obligations under other borrowing arrangements could trigger an obligation to repay the debt outstanding under the indenture 
in particular  a repayment obligation could be triggered if the company fails i to pay any scheduled principal or interest on any debt under any other indenture or agreement or ii to perform any other term in any other such indenture or agreement  and the effect of the failure causes  or would permit the holders of the debt to cause  the debt under such indenture or agreement to become due prior to its stated maturity  unless cured or waived 
the company s million committed credit facility also contains a cross default provision whereby the failure by the company or its significant subsidiaries to make payments under other borrowing arrangements  or the occurrence of certain events affecting those other borrowing arrangements  could trigger an obligation to repay any amounts outstanding under the committed credit facility 
in particular  a repayment obligation could be triggered if i the company or any of its significant subsidiaries fails to make a payment when due of any principal or interest on any other indebtedness aggregating million or more or ii an event occurs that causes  or would permit the holders of any other indebtedness aggregating million or more to cause  such indebtedness to become due prior to its stated maturity 
as of september   the company did not have any debt outstanding under the committed credit facility 
the company s embedded cost of long term debt was at september  and at september  if the company were to issue year long term debt today  its borrowing costs might be expected to be in the range of to 
refer to interest rate risk in this item for a more detailed breakdown of the company s embedded cost of long term debt 

table of contents current portion of long term debt at september  consists of million of medium term notes that matured in november currently  the company expects to refund these medium term notes in november with cash on hand  short term borrowings and or long term debt 
in november  the company repaid million of notes that matured on november  that were classified as current portion of long term debt at september  the company may issue debt or equity securities in a public offering or a private placement from time to time 
the amounts and timing of the issuance and sale of debt or equity securities will depend on market conditions  indenture requirements  regulatory authorizations and the capital requirements of the company 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has entered into certain off balance sheet financing arrangements 
these financing arrangements are primarily operating leases 
the company s consolidated subsidiaries have operating leases  the majority of which are with the utility and the pipeline and storage segments  having a remaining lease commitment of approximately million 
these leases have been entered into for the use of buildings  vehicles  construction tools  meters and other items and are accounted for as operating leases 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company s expected future contractual cash obligations as of september   and the twelve month periods over which they occur payments by expected maturity dates thereafter total millions long term debt  including interest expense operating lease obligations purchase obligations gas purchase contracts transportation and storage contracts well drilling  hydraulic fracturing and compression obligations pipeline and gathering system expansion projects other refer to note e capitalization and short term borrowings  as well as the table under interest rate risk in the market risk sensitive instruments section below  for the amounts excluding interest expense 
gas prices are variable based on the nymex prices adjusted for basis 
the company has other long term obligations recorded on its consolidated balance sheets that are not reflected in the table above 
such long term obligations include pension and other post retirement liabilities  asset retirement obligations  deferred income tax liabilities  various regulatory liabilities  derivative financial instrument liabilities and other deferred credits the majority of which consist of liabilities for non qualified benefit plans  deferred compensation liabilities  environmental liabilities  workers compensation liabilities and liabilities for income tax uncertainties 
the company has made certain other guarantees on behalf of its subsidiaries 
the guarantees relate primarily to i obligations under derivative financial instruments  which are included on the consolidated balance sheets in accordance with the authoritative guidance see item  md a under the heading critical accounting estimates accounting for derivative financial instruments  ii nfr obligations to purchase gas or to purchase gas transportation storage services where the amounts due on those obligations each month are included on the consolidated balance sheets as a current liability  and iii other obligations 
table of contents which are reflected on the consolidated balance sheets 
the company believes that the likelihood it would be required to make payments under the guarantees is remote  and therefore has not included them in the table above 
other matters in addition to the environmental and other matters discussed in this item and in item at note i commitments and contingencies  the company is involved in other litigation and regulatory matters arising in the normal course of business 
these other matters may include  for example  negligence claims and tax  regulatory or other governmental audits  inspections  investigations or other proceedings 
these matters may involve state and federal taxes  safety  compliance with regulations  rate base  cost of service and purchased gas cost issues  among other things 
while these normal course matters could have a material effect on earnings and cash flows in the period in which they are resolved  they are not expected to change materially the company s present liquidity position  nor are they expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the company 
the company has a tax qualified  noncontributory defined benefit retirement plan retirement plan that covers a majority of the company s employees 
the company has been making contributions to the retirement plan over the last several years and anticipates that it will continue making contributions to the retirement plan 
during  the company contributed million to the retirement plan 
the company anticipates that the annual contribution to the retirement plan in will be in the range of million to million 
changes in the discount rate  other actuarial assumptions  and asset performance could ultimately cause the company to fund larger amounts to the retirement plan in in order to be in compliance with the pension protection act of the company expects that all subsidiaries having employees covered by the retirement plan will make contributions to the retirement plan 
the funding of such contributions will come from amounts collected in rates in the utility and pipeline and storage segments or through short term borrowings or through cash from operations 
the company provides health care and life insurance benefits other post retirement benefits for a majority of its retired employees 
the company has established veba trusts and h accounts for its other post retirement benefits 
the company has been making contributions to its veba trusts and h accounts over the last several years and anticipates that it will continue making contributions to the veba trusts and h accounts 
during  the company contributed million to its veba trusts and h accounts 
the company anticipates that the annual contribution to its veba trusts and h accounts in will be in the range of million to million 
the funding of such contributions will come from amounts collected in rates in the utility and pipeline and storage segments 
as of september   the company has a federal net operating loss nol carryover of million  which expires in varying amounts between and approximately million of this nol is subject to certain annual limitations  and million is attributable to excess tax deductions related to stock based compensation 
in addition  the company has state nol carryovers in pennsylvania  california and new york of million  million and million  respectively  which begin to expire in varying amounts between and no valuation allowance was recorded on the federal or state nol carryovers because of management s determination that the amounts will be fully utilized during the carryforward period 
market risk sensitive instruments energy commodity price risk the company  in its exploration and production segment  energy marketing segment and pipeline and storage segment  uses various derivative financial instruments derivatives  including price swap agreements and futures contracts  as part of the company s overall energy commodity price risk management strategy 
under this strategy  the company manages a portion of the market risk associated with fluctuations in the 
table of contents price of natural gas and crude oil  thereby attempting to provide more stability to operating results 
the company has operating procedures in place that are administered by experienced management to monitor compliance with the company s risk management policies 
the derivatives are not held for trading purposes 
the fair value of these derivatives  as shown below  represents the amount that the company would receive from  or pay to  the respective counterparties at september  to terminate the derivatives 
however  the tables below and the fair value that is disclosed do not consider the physical side of the natural gas and crude oil transactions that are related to the financial instruments 
on july   the dodd frank act was signed into law 
the dodd frank act includes provisions related to the swaps and over the counter derivatives markets 
certain provisions of the dodd frank act related to derivatives became effective july   but other provisions related to derivatives will not become effective until federal agencies including the commodity futures trading commission cftc  various banking regulators and the sec adopt rules to implement the law 
for purposes of the dodd frank act  we believe that the company will be categorized as a non financial end user of derivatives  that is  as a non financial entity that uses derivatives to hedge commercial risk 
nevertheless  the rules that are being developed could have a significant impact on the company 
for example  banking regulators have proposed a rule that would require swap dealers and major swap participants subject to their jurisdiction to collect initial and variation margin from counterparties that are non financial end users  though such swap dealers and major swap participants would have the discretion to set thresholds for posting margin unsecured credit limits 
regardless of the levels of margin that might be required  concern remains that swap dealers and major swap participants will pass along their increased capital and margin costs through higher prices and reductions in thresholds for posting margin 
in addition  while the company expects to be exempt from the dodd frank act s requirement that swaps be cleared and traded on exchanges or swap execution facilities  the cost of entering into a non cleared swap that is available as a cleared swap may be greater 
the company continues to monitor these developments but cannot predict the impact the dodd frank act may ultimately have on its operations 
in accordance with the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements  the company has identified certain inputs used to recognize fair value as level unobservable inputs 
the level derivative net liabilities relate to oil swap agreements used to hedge forecasted sales at a specific location southern california 
the company s internal model that is used to calculate fair value applies a historical basis differential between the sales locations and nymex to a forward nymex curve because there is not a forward curve specific to this sales location 
given the high level of historical correlation between nymex prices and prices at this sales location  the company does not believe that the fair value recorded by the company would be significantly different from what it expects to receive upon settlement 
the level net liabilities amount to million at september  and represent of the total net assets shown in item at note f fair value measurements at september  the company uses the crude oil swaps classified as level to hedge against the risk of declining commodity prices and not as speculative investments 
gains or losses related to these level derivative net liabilities including any reduction for credit risk are deferred until the hedged commodity transaction occurs in accordance with the provisions of the existing guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the increase in the net fair value of the level positions from october  to september   as shown in item at note f  was attributable to a decrease in the commodity price of crude oil relative to the swap price during that period 
the company believes that these fair values reasonably represent the amounts that the company would realize upon settlement based on commodity prices that were present at september  the fair value of all of the company s net derivative assets was reduced by million based upon the company s assessment of counterparty credit risk for the company s derivative assets and the company s credit risk for the company s derivative liabilities 
the company applied default probabilities to the anticipated cash flows that it was expecting to receive and pay to its counterparties to calculate the credit reserve 

table of contents the following tables disclose natural gas and crude oil price swap information by expected maturity dates for agreements in which the company receives a fixed price in exchange for paying a variable price as quoted in various national natural gas publications or on the nymex 
notional amounts quantities are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract 
the weighted average variable prices represent the weighted average settlement prices by expected maturity date as of september  at september   the company had not entered into any natural gas or crude oil price swap agreements extending beyond natural gas price swap agreements expected maturity dates total notional quantities equivalent bcf weighted average fixed rate per mcf weighted average variable rate per mcf of the total bcf above  bcf is accounted for as fair value hedges at a weighted average fixed rate of per mcf 
the remaining bcf are accounted for as cash flow hedges at a weighted average fixed rate of per mcf 
crude oil price swap agreements expected maturity dates total notional quantities equivalent bbls weighted average fixed rate per bbl weighted average variable rate per bbl at september   the company would have received from its respective counterparties an aggregate of approximately million to terminate the natural gas price swap agreements outstanding at that date 
the company would have to pay its respective counterparties an aggregate of approximately million to terminate the crude oil price swap agreements outstanding at september  at september   the company had natural gas price swap agreements covering bcf at a weighted average fixed rate of per mcf 
the company also had crude oil price swap agreements covering  bbls at a weighted average fixed rate of per bbl 
the following table discloses the net contract volume purchased sold  weighted average contract prices and weighted average settlement prices by expected maturity date for futures contracts used to manage natural gas price risk 
at september   the company held no futures contracts with maturity dates extending beyond futures contracts expected maturity dates total net contract volume purchased sold equivalent bcf weighted average contract price per mcf weighted average settlement price per mcf the energy marketing segment has purchased futures contracts contract  dth for at september   the company had long purchased futures contracts covering bcf of gas extending through at a weighted average contract price of per mcf and a weighted average settlement price of per mcf 
of this amount  bcf is accounted for as fair value hedges and are used 
table of contents by the company s energy marketing segment to hedge against rising prices  a risk to which this segment is exposed to due to the fixed price gas sales commitments that it enters into with certain residential  commercial  industrial  public authority and wholesale customers 
the remaining bcf is accounted for as cash flow hedges used to hedge against rising prices related to anticipated gas purchases for potential injections into storage 
the company would have had to pay million to terminate these futures contracts at september  at september   the company had short sold futures contracts covering bcf of gas extending through at a weighted average contract price of per mcf and a weighted average settlement price of per mcf 
of this amount  bcf is accounted for as cash flow hedges as these contracts relate to the anticipated sale of natural gas by the energy marketing segment 
the remaining bcf is accounted for as fair value hedges used to hedge against falling prices  a risk to which the energy marketing segment is exposed to due to the fixed price gas purchase commitments that it enters into with its natural gas suppliers 
the company would have received million to terminate these futures contracts at september  at september   the company had long purchased futures contracts covering bcf of gas extending through at a weighted average contract price of per mcf and a weighted average settlement price of per mcf 
at september   the company had short sold futures contracts covering bcf of gas extending through at a weighted average contract price of per mcf and a weighted average settlement price of per mcf 
the company may be exposed to credit risk on any of the derivative financial instruments that are in a gain position 
credit risk relates to the risk of loss that the company would incur as a result of nonperformance by counterparties pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations 
to mitigate such credit risk  management performs a credit check  and then on a quarterly basis monitors counterparty credit exposure 
the majority of the company s counterparties are financial institutions and energy traders 
the company has over the counter swap positions with eleven counterparties of which ten are in a net gain position 
on average  the company had million of credit exposure per counterparty in a gain position at september  the maximum credit exposure per counterparty in a gain position at september  was million 
the company had not received any collateral from these counterparties at september  since the company s gain position on such derivative financial instruments had not exceeded the established thresholds at which the counterparties would be required to post collateral  nor had the counterparties credit ratings declined to levels at which the counterparties were required to post collateral 
as of september   eight of the eleven counterparties to the company s outstanding derivative instrument contracts specifically the over the counter swaps had a common credit risk related contingency feature 
in the event the company s credit rating increases or falls below a certain threshold applicable debt ratings  the available credit extended to the company would either increase or decrease 
a decline in the company s credit rating  in and of itself  would not cause the company to be required to increase the level of its hedging collateral deposits in the form of cash deposits  letters of credit or treasury debt instruments 
if the company s outstanding derivative instrument contracts were in a liability position or if the current liability were larger and or the company s credit rating declined  then additional hedging collateral deposits would be required 
at september   the fair market value of the derivative financial instrument assets with a credit risk related contingency feature was million according to the company s internal model discussed in item at note f fair value measurements 
at september   the fair market value of the derivative financial instrument liability with a credit risk related contingency feature was million according to the company s internal model discussed in item at note f fair value measurements 
for its over the counter crude oil swap agreements  which are in a liability position  the company was required to post million in hedging collateral deposits at september  this is discussed in item at note a under hedging collateral deposits 

table of contents for its exchange traded futures contracts which are in a liability position  the company had posted million in hedging collateral as of september  as these are exchange traded futures contracts  there are no specific credit risk related contingency features 
the company posts hedging collateral based on open positions and margin requirements it has with its counterparties 
the company s requirement to post hedging collateral deposits is based on the fair value determined by the company s counterparties  which may differ from the company s assessment of fair value 
hedging collateral deposits may also include closed derivative positions in which the broker has not cleared the cash from the account to offset the derivative liability 
the company records liabilities related to closed derivative positions in other accruals and current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
these liabilities are relieved when the broker clears the cash from the hedging collateral deposit account 
this is discussed in item at note a under hedging collateral deposits 
interest rate risk the following table presents the principal cash repayments and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity date for the company s long term fixed rate debt as well as the other long term debt of certain of the company s subsidiaries principal amounts by expected maturity dates thereafter total dollars in millions long term fixed rate debt weighted average interest rate paid fair value of long term fixed rate debt  rate and regulatory matters utility operation delivery rates for both the new york and pennsylvania divisions are regulated by the states respective public utility commissions and are changed only when approved through a procedure known as a rate case 
currently neither division has a rate case on file 
in both jurisdictions  delivery rates do not reflect the recovery of purchased gas costs 
prudently incurred gas costs are recovered through operation of automatic adjustment clauses  and are collected through a separately stated supply charge on the customer bill 
new york jurisdiction customer delivery rates charged by distribution corporation s new york division were established in a rate order issued on december  by the nypsc 
the rate order approved a revenue increase of million annually  together with a surcharge that would collect up to million to cover expenses for implementation of an efficiency and conservation incentive program 
the rate order further provided for a return on equity of 
in connection with the efficiency and conservation program  the rate order approved a revenue decoupling mechanism 
the revenue decoupling mechanism decouples revenues from throughput by enabling the company to collect from small volume customers its allowed margin on average weather normalized usage per customer 
the effect of the revenue decoupling mechanism is to render the company financially indifferent to throughput decreases resulting from conservation 
the company surcharges or credits any difference from the average weather normalized usage per customer account 
the surcharge or credit is calculated to recover total margin for the most recent twelve month period ending december  and is applied to customer bills annually  beginning march st 
on april   distribution corporation filed an appeal with supreme court  albany county  seeking review of the rate order 
the appeal contended  among other things  that the nypsc improperly disallowed recovery of certain environmental clean up costs 
following further appeals  on march   
table of contents the court of appeals  the state s highest court  issued a judgment and opinion in favor of distribution corporation 
the matter was remanded to the nypsc to be implemented consistent with the decision of the court 
pennsylvania jurisdiction distribution corporation s current delivery charges in its pennsylvania jurisdiction were approved by the papuc on november  as part of a settlement agreement that became effective january  pipeline and storage supply corporation filed a general rate case with the ferc on october   proposing rate increases to be effective december  the proposed rates reflect a cost of service of million  a rate base of million  and a proposed cost of equity of per year 
if the ferc accepts the filed rates  it would typically suspend the effective date of the proposed rate increases for five months  or until may   when the increased rates will be made effective  subject to refund 
if the rates finally approved at the end of the proceeding exceed the rates that were in effect at october  but are less than the rates put into effect subject to refund on may   supply corporation will be required to refund the difference between the rates collected subject to refund and the final approved rates  with interest at the ferc approved rate 
if the rates approved at the end of the proceeding are lower than the rates in effect at october   the refund obligation will be limited to the difference between the rates in effect at october  and the rates put into effect subject to refund on may   with interest at the ferc approved rate 
to the extent the final ferc approved rates are below those in effect at october   there is no refund for that rate differential 
the final ferc approved rates would be charged to customers only prospectively  from the date they go into effect 
empire s new facilities the empire connector project were placed into service on december  as of that date  empire became an interstate pipeline subject to ferc regulation  performing services under a ferc approved tariff and at ferc approved rates 
the december  ferc order issuing empire its certificate of public convenience and necessity requires empire to file a cost and revenue study at the ferc following three years of actual operation as an interstate pipeline  in conjunction with which empire will either justify empire s existing recourse rates or propose alternative rates 
environmental matters the company is subject to various federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment 
the company has established procedures for the ongoing evaluation of its operations to identify potential environmental exposures and comply with regulatory policies and procedures 
it is the company s policy to accrue estimated environmental clean up costs investigation and remediation when such amounts can reasonably be estimated and it is probable that the company will be required to incur such costs 
at september   the company has estimated its remaining clean up costs related to former manufactured gas plant sites and third party waste disposal sites will be in the range of million to million 
the minimum estimated liability of million has been recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at september  the company expects to recover its environmental clean up costs through rate recovery 
other than as discussed in note i referred to below  the company is currently not aware of any material additional exposure to environmental liabilities 
however  changes in environmental regulations  new information or other factors could adversely impact the company 
for further discussion refer to item at note i commitments and contingencies under the heading environmental matters 
legislative and regulatory measures to address climate change and greenhouse gas emissions are in various phases of discussion or implementation 
pursuant to an epa determination  effective january projects proposing new stationary sources of significant greenhouse gas emissions or major modifications of existing facilities are required under the federal clean air act to obtain permits covering such emissions 
the 
table of contents epa is also considering other regulatory options to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from the energy industry 
in april  the us senate rejected bills aimed at curbing the authority of the epa to regulate greenhouse gas emissions 
in addition  the us congress has from time to time considered bills that would establish a cap and trade program to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases 
legislation or regulation that restricts carbon emissions could increase the company s cost of environmental compliance by requiring the company to install new equipment to reduce emissions from larger facilities and or purchase emission allowances 
international  federal  state or regional climate change and greenhouse gas measures could also delay or otherwise negatively affect efforts to obtain permits and other regulatory approvals with regard to existing and new facilities  or impose additional monitoring and reporting requirements 
climate change and greenhouse gas initiatives  and incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources  could also reduce demand for oil and natural gas 
but legislation or regulation that sets a price on or otherwise restricts carbon emissions could also benefit the company by increasing demand for natural gas  because substantially fewer carbon emissions per btu of heat generated are associated with the use of natural gas than with certain alternate fuels such as coal and oil 
the effect material or not on the company of any new legislative or regulatory measures will depend on the particular provisions that are ultimately adopted 
new authoritative accounting and financial reporting guidance in may  the fasb issued authoritative guidance regarding fair value measurement as a joint project with the iasb 
the objective of the guidance was to bring together as closely as possible the fair value measurement and disclosure guidance issued by the two boards 
the guidance includes a few updates to measurement guidance and some enhanced disclosure requirements 
for all level fair value measurements  the guidance requires quantitative information about significant unobservable inputs used and a description of the valuation processes in place 
the guidance also requires a qualitative discussion about the sensitivity of recurring level fair value measurements and information about any transfers between level and level of the fair value hierarchy 
the new guidance also contains a requirement that all fair value measurements  whether they are recorded on the balance sheet or disclosed in the footnotes  be classified as level  level or level within the fair value hierarchy 
this authoritative guidance will be effective as of the company s second quarter of fiscal the company is currently evaluating the impact that adoption of this authoritative guidance will have on its consolidated financial statement disclosures 
in june  the fasb issued authoritative guidance regarding the presentation of comprehensive income 
the new guidance allows companies only two choices for presenting net income and other comprehensive income in a single continuous statement  or in two separate  but consecutive  statements 
the guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity 
this authoritative guidance will be effective as of the company s first quarter of fiscal and is not expected to have a significant impact on the company s financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued revised authoritative guidance that simplifies the testing of goodwill for impairment 
the revised guidance allows companies the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary 
the revised authoritative guidance is required to be effective for the company s annual impairment test performed in fiscal however  early adoption is permitted 
the company did not use the revised authoritative guidance in performing its annual impairment test for fiscal effects of inflation although the rate of inflation has been relatively low over the past few years  the company s operations remain sensitive to increases in the rate of inflation because of its capital spending and the regulated nature of a significant portion of its business
