item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes and the information contained elsewhere in this form k under the captions risk factors  selected financial data  and business 
overview we are a leading developer  marketer and distributor of branded performance apparel  footwear and accessories 
the brand s moisture wicking fabrications are engineered in many different designs and styles for wear in nearly every climate to provide a performance alternative to traditional products 
our products are sold 
table of contents worldwide and worn by athletes at all levels  from youth to professional  on playing fields around the globe  as well as by consumers with active lifestyles 
our net revenues grew to  million in from million in we believe that our growth in net revenues has been driven by a growing interest in performance products and the strength of the under armour brand in the marketplace relative to our competitors  as evidenced by the increases in our sales of our products 
we plan to continue to increase our net revenues over the long term by increased sales of our apparel  footwear and accessories  expansion of our wholesale distribution  growth in our direct to consumer sales channel and expansion in international markets 
our direct to consumer sales channel includes sales through our factory house and specialty stores  website  and catalog 
new product offerings for included basketball footwear which had a limited introduction in the united states and canada 
our products are currently offered in over twenty three thousand retail stores worldwide 
a large majority of our products are sold in north america  however we believe our products appeal to athletes and consumers with active lifestyles around the globe 
internationally  our products are offered primarily in austria  france  germany  ireland and the united kingdom  as well as in japan through a third party licensee  and through distributors located in other foreign countries 
we believe there is an increasing recognition of the health benefits of an active lifestyle 
we believe this trend provides us with an expanding consumer base for our products 
we also believe there is a continuing shift in consumer demand from traditional non performance products to our performance products  which are intended to provide better performance by wicking perspiration away from the skin  helping to regulate body temperature and enhancing comfort 
we believe that these shifts in consumer preferences and lifestyles are not unique to the united states  but are occurring in a number of markets globally  thereby increasing our opportunities to introduce our performance products to new consumers 
although we believe these trends will facilitate our growth  we also face potential challenges that could limit our ability to take advantage of these opportunities  including  among others  the risk of general economic or market conditions that could affect consumer spending and the financial health of our retail customers 
in addition  we may not be able to effectively manage our growth and a more complex business 
we may not consistently be able to anticipate consumer preferences and develop new and innovative products in a timely manner that meets changing preferences 
furthermore  our industry is very competitive  and competition pressures could cause us to reduce the prices of our products or otherwise affect our profitability 
we also rely on third party suppliers and manufacturers outside the us to provide fabrics and to produce our products  and disruptions to our supply chain could harm our business 
for a more complete discussion of the risks facing our business  refer to risk factors 
general net revenues comprise both net sales and license revenues 
net sales comprise sales from our primary product categories  which are apparel  footwear and accessories 
our license revenues consist of fees paid to us by our licensees in exchange for the use of our trademarks on core products of socks  headwear  bags  eyewear  custom molded mouth guards  other accessories and team uniforms  as well as the distribution of our products in japan 
we have developed our own headwear and bags  and beginning in  these products are being sold by us rather than by one of our licensees 
we expect our net revenues to increase by approximately million from to as a result of this change  which includes an increase in accessories revenues and a decrease in our license revenues in in addition we expect the related cost of goods sold to increase 
cost of goods sold consists primarily of product costs  inbound freight and duty costs  outbound freight costs  handling costs to make products floor ready to customer specifications  royalty payments to endorsers based on a predetermined percentage of sales of selected products and write downs for inventory obsolescence 
the fabrics in many of our products are made of petroleum based synthetic materials 
therefore our product 
table of contents costs  as well as our inbound and outbound freight costs  could be affected by long term pricing trends of oil 
in general  as a percentage of net revenues  we expect cost of goods sold associated with our footwear to be higher than the cost of goods sold associated with our apparel 
no cost of goods sold is associated with license revenues 
we include outbound freight costs associated with shipping goods to customers as cost of goods sold  however  we include the majority of outbound handling costs as a component of selling  general and administrative expenses 
as a result  our gross profit may not be comparable to that of other companies that include outbound handling costs in their cost of goods sold 
outbound handling costs include costs associated with preparing goods to ship to customers and certain costs to operate our distribution facilities 
these costs were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our selling  general and administrative expenses consist of costs related to marketing  selling  product innovation and supply chain and corporate services 
personnel costs are included in these categories based on the employees function 
personnel costs include salaries  benefits and incentive and stock based compensation expense related to the employee 
our marketing costs are an important driver of our growth 
marketing costs consist primarily of commercials  print ads  league  team  player and event sponsorships  amortization of footwear promotional rights and depreciation expense specific to our in store fixture program 
in addition  marketing costs include costs associated with our special make up shop smu shop located at one of our distribution facilities where we manufacture a limited number of products primarily for our league  team  player and event sponsorships 
selling costs consist primarily of costs relating to sales through our wholesale channel  the majority of our direct to consumer sales channel costs  along with commissions paid to third parties 
product innovation and supply chain costs include our apparel  footwear and accessories product innovation  sourcing and development costs  distribution facility operating costs  and costs relating to our hong kong and guangzhou  china offices which help support manufacturing  quality assurance and sourcing efforts 
corporate services primarily consist of corporate facility operating costs and company wide administrative expenses 
other expense  net consists of unrealized and realized gains and losses on our derivative financial instruments and unrealized and realized gains and losses on adjustments that arise from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relating to transactions generated by our international subsidiaries 
reclassifications outbound freight costs associated with shipping goods of million and million included in selling  general and administrative expenses for the years ended december  and  respectively  were reclassified to cost of goods sold to conform to the presentation for the year ended december  in addition  costs of million and million associated with our sourcing offices and smu shop included in cost of goods sold for the years ended december  and  respectively  were reclassified to selling  general and administrative expenses to conform to the presentation for the year ended december  we believe these changes were appropriate given our view that cost of goods sold should primarily include product costs which are variable in nature 
in addition  these reclassifications more closely align with the way we manage our business

historically  a larger portion of our income from operations has been in the last two quarters of the year partially due to the shift in the timing of marketing investments to the first two quarters of the year 
the majority of our net revenues were generated during the last two quarters in each of  and the level of our working capital generally reflects the seasonality and growth in our business 
we generally expect inventory  accounts payable and certain accrued expenses to be higher in the second and third quarters in preparation for the fall selling season

working capital is primarily funded from cash flows provided by operating activities and cash and cash equivalents on hand 
our working capital requirements generally reflect the seasonality and growth in our business as we recognize the majority of our net revenues in the back half of the year 
we fund our working capital  primarily inventory  and capital investments from cash flows provided by operating activities  cash and cash equivalents on hand and borrowings primarily available under our long term debt facilities 
our capital investments have included expanding our in store fixture and branded concept shop program  improvements and expansion of our distribution and corporate facilities to support our growth  leasehold improvements to our new factory house and specialty stores  and investment and improvements in information technology systems 
in  our capital expenditures are expected to include the purchase  subject to certain closing conditions  of part of our corporate office complex for million 
we intend to fund this purchase through additional debt 
our focus remains on inventory management including improving our planning capabilities  managing our inventory purchases  reducing our production lead times and selling excess inventory through our factory house stores and other liquidation channels 
however  we do expect several factors to contribute to inventory growth in excess of sales growth in the first half of we are increasing our safety stock in core product offerings and seasonal products to better meet consumer demand 
core product offerings are products that we generally plan to have available for sale for at least the next twelve months at full price 
in addition  beginning in  headwear and bags are being sold by us rather than by one of our licensees  which will also contribute to our expected year over year inventory growth 
we believe our cash and cash equivalents on hand  cash from operations and borrowings available to us under our revolving credit and long term debt facilities will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
we may require additional capital to meet our longer term liquidity and future growth needs 
although we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity over the long term  a prolonged economic recession or a slow recovery could adversely affect our business and liquidity refer to the risk factors section included in item a 
in addition  instability in or tightening of the capital markets could adversely affect our ability to obtain additional capital to grow our business and will affect the cost and terms of such capital

financing activities cash provided by financing activities increased million to million in from cash used in financing activities of million in this increase was primarily due to the final payment made on our prior revolving credit facility that was terminated during cash used in financing activities increased million to million in from cash provided by financing activities of million in this increase was primarily due to additional net payments made on our revolving credit and long term debt facilities in as compared to revolving credit facility we have a revolving credit facility with certain lending institutions 
the revolving credit facility has a term of three years  expiring in january  and provides for a committed revolving credit line of up to million based on our qualified domestic inventory and accounts receivable balances 
the commitment amount 
table of contents under the revolving credit facility may be increased by an additional million  subject to certain conditions and approvals under the credit agreement 
the revolving credit facility may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes 
it is collateralized by substantially all of our assets and the assets of our domestic subsidiaries other than our trademarks  and by a pledge of of the equity interests of certain of our foreign subsidiaries 
up to million of the revolving credit facility may be used to support letters of credit  of which no amounts were outstanding as of december  we must maintain a certain leverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement 
as of december   we were in compliance with these financial covenants 
the revolving credit facility also provides our lenders with the ability to reduce the borrowing base  even if we are in compliance with all conditions of the revolving credit facility  upon a material adverse change to our business  properties  assets  financial condition or results of operations 
the revolving credit facility contains a number of restrictions that limit our ability  among other things  and subject to certain limited exceptions  to incur additional indebtedness  pledge our assets as security  guaranty obligations of third parties  make investments  undergo a merger or consolidation  dispose of assets  or materially change our line of business 
in addition  the revolving credit facility includes a cross default provision whereby an event of default under other debt obligations  as defined in the credit agreement  will be considered an event of default under this credit agreement 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest based on the daily balance outstanding at a libor rate option with libor subject to a rate floor of plus an applicable margin varying from to or  in certain cases at our discretion  a base rate option based on the prime rate or as otherwise specified in the credit agreement  with the base rate subject to a rate floor of plus an applicable margin varying from to 
the revolving credit facility also carries a commitment fee varying from to of the committed line amount less outstanding borrowings and letters of credit 
the applicable margins are calculated quarterly and vary based on our leverage ratio as set forth in the credit agreement 
prior to entering the revolving credit facility in january  we terminated our prior million revolving credit facility 
in conjunction with the termination of the prior revolving credit facility  we repaid the then outstanding balance of million 
the prior revolving credit facility was also collateralized by substantially all of our assets  other than our trademarks  and included covenants  conditions and other terms similar to our current revolving credit facility 
as of december   borrowings under our million revolving credit facility were limited to approximately million based on our eligible domestic inventory and accounts receivable balances 
the weighted average interest rate on the balances outstanding under the prior revolving credit facility was and during the years ended december  and no balances were outstanding under the current revolving credit facility during the years ended december  and  respectively 
long term debt we have long term debt agreements with various lenders to finance the acquisition of or lease of qualifying capital investments 
loans under these agreements are collateralized by a first lien on the related assets acquired 
as these agreements are not committed facilities  each advance is subject to approval by the lenders 
additionally  these agreements include a cross default provision whereby an event of default under other debt obligations  including our revolving credit facility  will be considered an event of default under these agreements 
in addition  these agreements require a prepayment fee if we pay outstanding amounts ahead of the scheduled terms 
the terms of our revolving credit facility limit the total amount of additional financing under these agreements to million  of which million was remaining as of december  at december  and  the outstanding principal balance under these agreements was million and million  respectively 
currently  advances under these agreements bear interest rates which are fixed at the time of each advance 
the weighted average interest rate on outstanding borrowings was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 

table of contents we monitor the financial health and stability of our lenders under the revolving credit and long term debt facilities  however continuing significant instability in the credit markets could negatively impact lenders and their ability to perform under their facilities 
contractual commitments and contingencies we lease warehouse space  office facilities  space for our factory house and specialty stores and certain equipment under non cancelable operating and capital leases 
the leases expire at various dates through  excluding extensions at our option  and contain various provisions for rental adjustments 
in addition  this table includes executed lease agreements for factory house stores that we did not yet occupy as of december  the operating leases generally contain renewal provisions for varying periods of time 
our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of december  are summarized in the following table payments due by period in thousands total less than year to years to years more than years contractual obligations long term debt obligations operating lease obligations product purchase obligations sponsorships and other total excludes a total of million in interest payments on long term debt obligations 
includes the minimum payments for operating lease obligations 
the operating lease obligations do not include any contingent rent expense we may incur at our factory house stores based on future sales above a specified minimum or payments made for maintenance  insurance and real estate taxes 
we generally place orders with our manufacturers at least three to four months in advance of expected future sales 
the amounts listed for product purchase obligations primarily represent our open production purchase orders for our apparel  footwear and accessories  including expected inbound freight  duties and other costs 
these open purchase orders specify fixed or minimum quantities of products at determinable prices 
the reported amounts exclude product purchase liabilities included in accounts payable as of december  includes footwear promotional rights fees  sponsorships of individual athletes  sports teams and athletic events and other marketing commitments in order to promote our brand 
some of these sponsorship agreements provide for additional performance incentives and product supply obligations 
it is not possible to determine how much we will spend on product supply obligations on an annual basis as contracts generally do not stipulate specific cash amounts to be spent on products 
the amount of product provided to these sponsorships depends on many factors including general playing conditions  the number of sporting events in which they participate and our decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives 
in addition  the costs to design  develop  source and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers 
in addition  it is not possible to determine the amounts we may be required to pay under these agreements as they are primarily subject to certain performance based variables 
the amounts listed above are the fixed minimum amounts required to be paid under these agreements 
the table above excludes a million liability for uncertain tax positions  including the related interest and penalties  recorded in accordance with applicable accounting guidance  as we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of settlement 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our uncertain tax positions 

table of contents in addition  the table above excludes the expected purchase of part of our corporate office complex of million 
the purchase is subject to certain closing conditions 
we expect the transaction to close in early we expect this transaction to have minimal impact on cash flows both from a purchase perspective and on a go forward operational basis  as we intend to fund this purchase through additional debt 
off balance sheet arrangements in connection with various contracts and agreements  we have agreed to indemnify counterparties against certain third party claims relating to the infringement of intellectual property rights and other items 
generally  such indemnification obligations do not apply in situations in which our counterparties are grossly negligent  engage in willful misconduct  or act in bad faith 
based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss  we have determined the fair value of such indemnifications is not material to our financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
to prepare these financial statements  we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results could be significantly different from these estimates 
we believe the following discussion addresses the critical accounting policies that are necessary to understand and evaluate our reported financial results 
revenue recognition net revenues consist of both net sales and license revenues 
net sales are recognized upon transfer of ownership  including passage of title to the customer and transfer of risk of loss related to those goods 
transfer of title and risk of loss are based upon shipment under free on board shipping point for most goods or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer 
in some instances  transfer of title and risk of loss take place at the point of sale  for example at our factory house and specialty stores 
we may also ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer 
license revenues are recognized based upon shipment of licensed products sold by our licensees 
sales returns  allowances  markdowns and discounts we record reductions to revenue for estimated customer returns  allowances  markdowns and discounts 
we base our estimates on historical rates of customer returns and allowances as well as the specific identification of outstanding returns  markdowns and allowances that have not yet been received by us 
the actual amount of customer returns and allowances  which is inherently uncertain  may differ from our estimates 
if we determine that actual or expected returns or allowances are significantly higher or lower than the reserves we established  we would record a reduction or increase  as appropriate  to net sales in the period in which we make such a determination 
provisions for customer specific discounts are based on contractual obligations with certain major customers 
reserves for returns  allowances  markdowns and discounts are recorded as an offset to accounts receivable as settlements are made through offsets to outstanding customer invoices 
prior to  the majority of reserves for customer markdowns and discounts were recorded as accrued expenses as settlements were made through cash disbursements 
as of december   there were million in customer markdowns and discounts recorded as offsets to accounts receivable  and no amounts were recorded as accrued expenses 
as of 
table of contents december   there were no significant customer markdowns or discounts recorded as offsets to accounts receivable  and million was recorded as accrued expenses 
allowance for doubtful accounts we make ongoing estimates relating to the collectability of our accounts receivable and maintain a reserve for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
in determining the amount of the reserve  we consider our historical levels of credit losses and significant economic developments within the retail environment that could impact the ability of our customers to pay outstanding balances and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations 
because we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers  future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  a larger reserve might be required 
in the event we determine that a smaller or larger reserve was appropriate  we would record a benefit or charge to selling  general and administrative expenses in the period in which we made such a determination 
inventory valuation and reserves we value our inventory at standard cost which approximates our landed cost  using the first in  first out method of cost determination 
market value is estimated based upon assumptions made about future demand and retail market conditions 
if we determine that the estimated market value of our inventory is less than the carrying value of such inventory  we provide a charge to cost of goods sold to reflect the lower of cost or market 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by us  further adjustments may be required that would increase our cost of goods sold in the period in which we make such a determination 
impairment of long lived assets we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful life of long lived assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balance may not be recoverable 
these factors may include a significant deterioration of operating results  changes in business plans  or changes in anticipated cash flows 
when factors indicate that an asset should be evaluated for possible impairment  we review long lived assets to assess recoverability from future operations using undiscounted cash flows 
impairments are recognized in earnings to the extent that the carrying value exceeds fair value 
no material impairments were recorded in the years ended december   and income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are established for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities at tax rates expected to be in effect when such assets or liabilities are realized or settled 
deferred income tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances when necessary 
assessing whether deferred tax assets are realizable requires significant judgment 
we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including historical operating performance and expectations of future operating performance 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is often dependent upon future taxable income and therefore can be uncertain 
to the extent we believe it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the asset will not be realized  valuation allowances are established against our deferred tax assets  which increase income tax expense in the period when such a determination is made 
income taxes include the largest amount of tax benefit for an uncertain tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position 
settlements with tax authorities  the expiration of statutes of limitations for particular tax positions  or obtaining new information on particular tax positions may cause a change to the effective tax rate 
we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of income 

table of contents stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with accounting guidance that requires all stock based compensation awards granted to employees and directors to be measured at fair value and recognized as an expense in the financial statements 
historically  we recognized expense for stock based compensation awards granted prior to our initial filing of our s registration statement in accordance with accounting guidance that allows the intrinsic value method 
under the intrinsic value method  stock based compensation expense of fixed stock options is based on the difference  if any  between the fair value of our stock on the grant date and the exercise price of the option 
the stock based compensation expense for these awards was fully amortized in as of december   we had million of unrecognized compensation expense  excluding performance based stock options  expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
in addition  we had million of unrecognized compensation expense related to performance based stock options  expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years if all combined operating income targets would be reached 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock based compensation awards require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the stock based compensation awards  stock price volatility and estimated forfeiture rates 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock based compensation awards 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock based compensation awards represent management s best estimates  but the estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
in addition  compensation expense for performance based awards is recorded over the related service period when achievement of the performance target is deemed probable  which requires management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
refer to note and note to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on stock based compensation 
recently adopted accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an amendment to the accounting and disclosure requirements for the consolidation of variable interest entities vies 
this amendment requires an enterprise to perform a qualitative analysis when determining whether or not it must consolidate a vie 
the amendment also requires an enterprise to continuously reassess whether it must consolidate a vie 
finally  an enterprise will be required to disclose significant judgments and assumptions used to determine whether or not to consolidate a vie 
this amendment is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after november   and for interim periods within the first annual period 
the adoption of this amendment did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk foreign currency exchange and foreign currency risk management and derivatives we currently generate a small amount of our consolidated net revenues in canada and europe 
the reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements is the us dollar 
to date  net revenues generated outside of the united states have not been significant 
however  as our net revenues generated outside of the united states increase  our results of operations could be adversely impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
for example  if we recognize foreign revenues in local foreign currencies as we currently do in canada and europe and if the us dollar strengthens  it could have a negative impact on our foreign revenues upon translation of those results into the us dollar upon consolidation of our financial statements 
in addition  we are exposed to gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on transactions generated by our foreign subsidiaries in currencies other than their local currencies 
these gains and losses are primarily driven by inter company transactions 
these exposures are included in other expense  net on the consolidated statements of income 

table of contents when deemed necessary  we have used foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the risk from exchange rate fluctuations on inter company transactions and projected inventory purchases for our european and canadian subsidiaries 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
based on the foreign currency forward contracts outstanding as of december   we receive us dollars in exchange for canadian dollars at a weighted average contractual forward foreign currency exchange rate of cad per and us dollars in exchange for euros at a weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rate of eur per 
as of december   the notional value of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts for our canadian subsidiary was million with contract maturities of month  and the notional value of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts for our european subsidiary was million with contract maturities of month 
the foreign currency forward contracts are not designated as cash flow hedges  and accordingly  changes in their fair value are recorded in other expense  net on the consolidated statements of income 
the fair values of our foreign currency forward contracts were liabilities of million as of december   and were included in accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheet 
the fair values of our foreign currency forward contracts were assets of million as of december   and were included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet 
refer to note for a discussion of the fair value measurements 
included in other expense  net were the following amounts related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and derivative foreign currency forward contracts year ended december  in thousands unrealized foreign currency exchange rate gains losses realized foreign currency exchange rate losses unrealized derivative gains losses realized derivative gains losses although we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize some of the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on future cash flows  we cannot be assured that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
inflation inflationary factors such as increases in the cost of our product and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results 
although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date  a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs
