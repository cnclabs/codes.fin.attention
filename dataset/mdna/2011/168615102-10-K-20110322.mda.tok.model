item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
executive overview we are a national specialty retailer of private branded  sophisticated  casual to dressy clothing  intimates  complementary accessories  and other non clothing gift items operating under the chico s  white house black market  and soma intimates brand names 
we earn revenues and generate cash through the sale of merchandise in our retail stores  on our various websites and through our call centers  which take orders for all brands 
results of initiatives fiscal s results are a reflection of our continued progress in executing the goals that we have established as being vital to the performance of our company 
these goals were and continue to be improving the performance of the chico s brand investing in the growth potential of the wh bm and soma brands accelerating the investment in and growth of the direct to consumer dtc channel controlling expenses and rationalizing the expense structure improving inventory control chico s the performance of the chico s brand during fiscal was a clear indication that we have made significant progress in our turnaround efforts 
chico s had its best comparable store sales performance since fiscal we believe this is attributable to our ability to provide customers with fresh and trend right merchandise offerings supported by novel and timely marketing campaigns as well as personalized customer service 
in fiscal  the chico s brand also focused on increasing the penetration of its made for outlet product which resulted in improved profitability for our stores in the outlet channel 
wh bm the wh bm brand had another successful year in fiscal with total sales reaching million  an increase of over last year 
wh bm added touches of bright and vibrant color accents to its fashion selection at various times  which proved to be a big hit with our customer and a significant driver behind the brand s improved results over fiscal soma we continue to believe in the growth potential of the soma brand and are encouraged by its progress in fiscal during  soma introduced its first television advertising campaign since  which served to attract new customers and reactivate lapsed customers 
direct to consumer in fiscal  net sales for the dtc channel increased to million 
this increase in fiscal follows a similar increase in expense structure selling  general and administrative sg a expenses during fiscal increased over fiscal mostly as a result of costs associated with operating net  new stores opened since the end of fiscal and planned increases in marketing expenses 
however  as a percentage of net sales  sg a for fiscal decreased by over basis points compared to fiscal inventory management effective inventory management is essential in enabling us to offer our customers an appropriate selection of current merchandise 
during fiscal  we believe that we improved our in stock levels and inventory turnover in an effort to limit the markdowns needed to clear merchandise 
furthermore  we believe our inventory balance at year end is in line with our current sales trend 

table of contents financial highlights for fiscal net sales increased to billion  the highest in our history  compared to billion in  and consolidated comparable store sales increased following a increase last year 
including dtc sales  consolidated comparable sales increased in on top of a increase last year 
income from operations  as a percentage of net sales  was compared to in  or an increase of basis points over last year 
net income was million compared to million in  and earnings per diluted share increased to compared to last year 
net income for and included million and million of pre tax non cash impairment charges  respectively 
cash and marketable securities ended the year at million  an increase of over last year  after considering that we paid million of dividends and repurchased and retired million of our common stock through our share repurchase program announced in august cash flows from operations for were million compared with million in  an increase of 
key performance indicators in order to monitor our success  we review certain key performance indicators  including comparable sales growth in  our comparable store sales sales from stores open for at least twelve full months  including stores that have been expanded or relocated within the same general market improved across all three brands 
beginning in fiscal  we will report comparable sales inclusive of dtc 
we are channel agnostic when it comes to sales and it has become increasingly apparent that store sales and dtc sales are intertwined 
since we have moved to a pooled inventory effort to support stores and dtc accompanied by cross channel marketing initiatives  it is difficult to discern a portion of our sales that should be credited to the appropriate channel 
we believe that our ability to deliver consistent increases in comparable sales will be a key factor in determining our future levels of success 
positive operating cash flow and capital expenditures historically  a key strength of the business has been the ability to consistently generate cash flow from operations 
we believe the consistent generation of cash flows sufficient to fund operations and capital expenditures is and will be a key performance indicator for us 
store productivity we consistently monitor various key performance indicators of store productivity including sales per square foot  store operating contribution margin and store cash flow in order to assess our performance 
inventory management we actively manage our inventories based on seasonal trends  store productivity results and anticipated sales volumes  which may lead to increased or decreased inventory levels 
we believe that constant monitoring of our inventories on a per square foot basis assists us in planning future sales  determining markdowns and assessing our customer s response to the merchandise 
future outlook for fiscal  we are currently forecasting a low to mid single digit increase in comparable sales inclusive of dtc with slight improvement expected in our gross margin rate as a percentage of net sales 
although we expect our sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales to decrease reflecting leverage based on the forecasted comparable sales increase  we anticipate approximately million of incremental marketing costs over last year as well as the costs associated with opening to net  new stores 
capital expenditures for fiscal are expected to range between million to million  which contemplates the opening of approximately to net new stores as well as continued enhancements of our information technology systems and other infrastructure costs including dtc automation projects 

table of contents results of operations net sales the following table depicts net sales by chico s soma and wh bm in dollars and as a percentage of total net sales for fiscal current period  fiscal prior period  and fiscal dollar amounts in thousands net sales fiscal fiscal fiscal chico s soma wh bm total net sales net sales by chico s soma and wh bm increased from the prior period primarily due to positive comparable sales including dtc sales for all three brands as well as new store openings 
a summary of the factors impacting year over year sales increases is provided in the table below dollar amounts in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal comparable store sales increases decreases comparable store sales comparable sales including dtc net non comp store sales increase direct to consumer sales increases decreases consolidated comparable sales increased in fiscal and were driven by an approximate increase in transactions at chico s front line stores  which was partially offset by a slight decrease in units per transaction 
in addition  wh bm stores experienced an increase in both transactions and units per transaction in fiscal the increase in consolidated comparable sales is also attributable to a increase in net dtc sales in fiscal over fiscal due to enhanced website functionality  increased dtc promotions and expanded online product offerings  including clearance items 
comparable store sales excluding dtc sales for the chico s soma brands increased by while the wh bm brand s comparable store sales increased by over last year 
the consolidated comparable store sales increase of in fiscal was driven primarily by an approximate increase in the chico s average unit retail price  which was partially offset by a slight decrease in units per transaction at chico s front line stores 
comparable store sales results also benefited from an increase in both the average unit retail price as well as total transactions at the wh bm brand compared to the like period in fiscal the chico s soma brands comparable store sales increased by approximately and the wh bm brand s comparable store sales increased by approximately compared to the like period in fiscal net sales by the dtc for fiscal increased by million  or  compared to fiscal due to enhanced functionality on our websites and improved online assortments 
consolidated comparable sales  which include dtc sales  increased in fiscal by over fiscal cost of goods sold gross margin the following table depicts cost of goods sold and gross margin in dollars and gross margin as a percentage of net sales for fiscal  and dollar amounts in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal cost of goods sold gross margin gross margin percentage as a percentage of net sales  gross margin increased by only basis points in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase was mainly attributable to improved merchandise margins at outlet stores due to increased penetration of made for outlet product but offset  for the most part  by a slight decrease in merchandise margins at chico s front line stores 
this decrease in merchandise margins was primarily driven by increases in markdowns for fiscal  partially offset by slightly higher initial markups for the chico s brand 

table of contents gross margin percentage increased by basis points in fiscal compared to fiscal the gross margin increase was attributable to significant improvements in the merchandise margins at both the chico s and wh bm brands 
both brands benefited from substantially lower markdowns and  to a lesser extent  higher initial markups 
these improvements in gross margin were slightly offset by continued investment in merchandise and product development including technology initiatives 
store and direct operating expenses the following table depicts store and direct operating expenses in dollars and as a percentage of total net sales for fiscal  and dollar amounts in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal store and direct operating expenses percentage of total net sales store and direct operating expenses include store and dtc operational expenses  and reflect such items as personnel  occupancy  credit card fees  depreciation and supplies  incurred to operate each of our stores and the dtc channel 
in addition  store and direct operating expenses include support expenditures for district and regional management expenses and other store support functions 
store and direct operating expenses increased by million over fiscal primarily due to increased store labor costs and occupancy expense associated with net new stores over last year  accompanied by increased in store promotions and higher credit card fees due to higher sales volume compared to last year 
store operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased by basis points in fiscal due to the leverage associated with positive comparable store sales 
in fiscal  store operating expenses increased slightly in dollars due to higher occupancy costs but  as a percentage of net sales  decreased by basis points due to the leverage from positive comparable store sales as well as effective implementation of ongoing cost saving initiatives at the store level 
marketing the following table depicts marketing expenses in dollars and as a percentage of total net sales for fiscal  and dollar amounts in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal marketing percentage of total net sales marketing expenses include marketing programs such as direct marketing efforts  national advertising expenses via various media and related support costs 
marketing expenses increased in fiscal by million compared to fiscal mainly due to planned increases in marketing initiatives across all three brands  particularly with television advertising and e marketing initiatives 
as a percentage of net sales  marketing expenses increased basis points in fiscal compared to fiscal marketing expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales by approximately basis points in fiscal compared to fiscal mainly due to the leverage from positive comparable store sales 
in addition  marketing expenses in dollars decreased due to savings in direct mailing costs attributable to both decreased materials costs and circulations  partially offset by an increase in broadcast and print advertisement 

table of contents national store support center the following table depicts nssc expenses in dollars and as a percentage of total net sales for fiscal  and dollar amounts in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal nssc percentage of total net sales nssc expenses consist of corporate level functions including executive management  human resources  management information systems and finance  among others 
in fiscal  nssc expenses increased slightly mainly due to increased recruiting and relocation costs 
however  as a percentage of net sales  nssc expenses decreased by basis points due to the leverage associated with positive comparable store sales for the year 
nssc expenses in fiscal increased slightly in dollars mainly due to increased incentive compensation costs  offset by back office cost reduction initiatives 
however  as a percentage of net sales  nssc expenses decreased by basis points due to the leverage associated with the positive comparable store sales 
impairment and restructuring charges the following table depicts impairment and restructuring charges in dollars and as a percentage of total net sales for fiscal  and dollar amounts in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal impairment and restructuring charges percentage of total net sales the impairment charges recognized in fiscal include non cash impairment charges incurred in the first and fourth quarters of the year 
an evaluation of long lived assets at certain underperforming stores for indicators of impairment was performed and  as a result  we determined that the carrying values of certain assets exceeded their future undiscounted cash flows 
the fair value of these assets was determined by discounting their future cash flows using a rate approximating our cost of capital  which resulted in an impairment charge of approximately million and million in the first and fourth quarters  respectively 
the impairment charges recognized in fiscal include non cash impairment charges incurred in the first  second and fourth quarters of the year 
during the first quarter of fiscal  an impairment charge totaling million was recorded related to the write off of development costs for software applications 
during the second quarter of fiscal  a non cash charge totaling million was incurred related to the partial write off of a note receivable and million in non cash impairment charges related to the write off of fixed assets at certain underperforming stores 
during the fourth quarter  an additional non cash impairment charge of million was taken on the aforementioned note receivable based on a further evaluation of the underlying collateral 
the impairment and restructuring charges recognized in fiscal consisted of non cash impairment charges totaling million related to the write off of fixed assets at certain underperforming stores  and severance and workforce reduction costs totaling million related to the elimination of approximately of the nssc employee base and charges associated with the separation agreement with our former chief executive officer 
virtually all payments related to the severance and workforce reduction action were completed in fiscal interest income  net the following table depicts interest income  net in dollars and as a percentage of total net sales for fiscal  and dollar amounts in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal interest income  net percentage of total net sales 
table of contents in fiscal  interest income  net  was flat in total dollars and as a percentage of net sales compared to fiscal in fiscal  interest income  net  decreased in total dollars and as a percentage of net sales compared to fiscal primarily due to lower interest rates on our investments and  to a lesser extent  due to the reversal and non accrual of interest income in fiscal on a note receivable for which interest was deemed uncollectible 
provision for income taxes our effective tax rate was  and  for fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate for fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to the favorable settlement of certain state tax examinations 
the decrease in the effective tax rate for fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to the favorable settlement of certain state tax examinations and the expiration of various statutes of limitation relating to certain state tax accruals 
liquidity and capital resources overview our ongoing capital requirements have been and are for funding capital expenditures for new  expanded  relocated and remodeled stores  the continued improvement in information technology tools  and our distribution center and other central support facilities 
the following table depicts our capital resources at the end of fiscal year and amounts in thousands fiscal fiscal cash and cash equivalents marketable securities working capital working capital increased from fiscal to fiscal primarily due to an increase in marketable securities resulting from a higher cash flow from operations 
the significant components of working capital are cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and inventories  reduced by accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
based on past performance and current expectations  we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and cash generated from operations will satisfy working capital needs  future capital expenditures see new store openings and infrastructure investments  commitments  dividend payments  potential share repurchases and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations through at least the next months 
furthermore  while it is our intention to pay a quarterly cash dividend for fiscal and beyond  any determination to pay future dividends will be made by the board of directors and will depend on future earnings  financial conditions and other factors 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was million  an increase of approximately million from fiscal primarily due to higher net income  mainly as a result of increased sales  and accounts payable leverage partially offset by an increase in inventory investment 
net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was million  an increase of approximately million from fiscal  and resulted primarily from higher net income and increases in accounts payable 
in fiscal  net cash from operating activities was million  and was due primarily to non cash adjustments which served to offset the net loss from operations 
these adjustments included depreciation and amortization expense  deferred tax benefits  stock based compensation  and an impairment of long lived assets  as well as changes in accounts receivables  payables and inventory 

table of contents investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
we had net purchases of million of marketable securities in the current year compared to million of net purchases in fiscal our approximate million increased investment in capital expenditures when compared to the prior year was primarily related to costs associated with new  relocated  remodeled and expanded chico s  soma and wh bm stores offset slightly by a decrease in distribution center investments 
financing activities net cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million in fiscal in fiscal  we declared and paid four quarterly per share cash dividends on our common stock totaling million and repurchased million of our common stock through the share repurchase program announced in august in the current and prior fiscal years  we received proceeds from both the issuance of common stock related to option exercises and employee participation in our employee stock purchase plan 
during fiscal  and  we repurchased   and  shares  respectively  of restricted stock in connection with employee tax withholding obligations under employee compensation plans  which are not purchases under any publicly announced plan 
new store openings and infrastructure investments we expect our new stores in fiscal to increase approximately  reflecting net openings of chico s stores  net openings of wh bm stores  and net openings of soma stores 
we also expect to complete relocations or expansions 
we continuously evaluate the appropriate new store growth rate in light of economic conditions and may adjust the growth rate as conditions require or as opportunities arise 
we believe that the liquidity needed for new stores  including the continued investment associated with the soma brand  our continuing store remodel expansion program  the investments required for our distribution center  our continued installation and upgrading of new and existing software packages  and investment in inventory levels associated with this growth will be funded primarily from cash flow from operations and our existing cash and marketable securities balances  and  if necessary  the capacity included in our bank credit facility 
at the beginning of fiscal  we completed the second major phase of our multi year  planned implementation of our enterprise resource planning erp system and we are currently utilizing this system in all of our brands 
the third major phase includes ongoing enhancements and optimization of the new erp across all three brands  as well as the deployment of additional functionality across various other functions 
in fiscal  we purchased jda enterprise planning  jda assortment planning and jda allocation software applications and curtailed the previously planned implementations of related sap applications and revised our roll out plan accordingly 
we completed the implementation of the allocation functionality during fiscal  installed enterprise planning in  and are currently working on implementing the additional jda planning applications over the next months 
additionally  we are developing a product lifecycle management solution supporting the design and development process 
given our existing cash and marketable securities balances and the capacity included in our bank credit facility  we do not believe that we will need to seek other sources of financing to conduct our operations  pay future dividends or pursue our expansion plans even if cash flow from operations should prove to be less than anticipated  or if there should arise a need for additional letter of credit capacity due to establishing new and expanded sources of supply  or if we were to increase the number of new stores planned to be opened in future periods 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at january  amounts in thousands less than after total year years years years operating leases non cancelable purchase commitments total as of january   our contractual obligations consisted of amounts outstanding under operating leases and non cancelable purchase commitments 
amounts due under non cancelable purchase commitments consist of amounts to be paid under agreements to purchase inventory 
until formal resolutions are reached between us and the relevant taxing authorities  we are unable to estimate a final determination related to our uncertain tax positions and therefore  we have excluded the uncertain tax positions  totaling million at january  from the above table 
on november   we entered into a million senior secured revolving credit facility the credit facility with suntrust bank  as administrative agent and lender and suntrust robinson humphrey  inc as lead arranger 
the credit facility provides a million revolving credit facility that matures on november  the credit facility provides for swing advances of up to million and issuance of letters of credit up to million 
the credit facility also contains a feature that provides us the ability  subject to satisfaction of certain conditions  to increase the commitments available under the credit facility from million up to million through additional syndication 
the proceeds of any borrowings under the credit facility may be used to fund future permitted acquisitions  to provide for working capital and for other general corporate purposes 
off balance sheet arrangements at january  and january   we did not have any relationship with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or for other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
therefore  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors  and believes the following assumptions and estimates are significant to reporting our results of operations and financial position 
inventory valuation and shrinkage we identify potentially excess and slow moving inventories by evaluating turn rates and inventory levels in conjunction with our overall sales trend 
excess quantities of inventory are identified through evaluation of inventory aging  review of inventory turns and historical sales experiences  as well as specific identification based 
table of contents on fashion trends 
further  exposure to inadequate realization of carrying value is identified through analysis of gross margins and markdowns in combination with changes in current business trends 
we provide lower of cost or market adjustments for such identified excess and slow moving inventories 
historically  the variation of those estimates to observed results has been insignificant and  although possible  significant variation is not expected in the future 
if  however  our markdown rate and cost percentage estimates varied by of their values  the carrying amount of inventory would have changed by approximately million 
we estimate our expected shrinkage of inventories between our physical inventory counts by applying the most recent average store shrinkage experience 
these rates are updated to reflect the most recent physical inventory shrinkage experience 
historically  the variation of those estimates to observed results has been insignificant and  although possible  significant variation is not expected in the future 
if  however  our estimated shrinkage percentages increased by  we would have incurred approximately million in additional expense and the carrying amount of inventory would have changed by approximately million 
revenue recognition although our recognition of revenue does not involve significant judgment  revenue recognition represents an important accounting policy 
retail sales at our stores are recorded at the point of sale and are net of estimated customer returns  sales discounts under the passport club and the black book loyalty programs and company issued coupons  promotional discounts and associate discounts 
we record dtc revenue based on the estimated receipt date of the product by our customers 
under our current program  gift cards do not have expiration dates 
we account for gift cards by recognizing a liability at the time the gift card is sold 
the liability is relieved and revenue is recognized for gift cards upon redemption 
in addition  we recognize revenue on unredeemed gift cards based on determining that the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed is remote and that there is no legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift cards to relevant jurisdictions commonly referred to as gift card breakage 
we recognize gift card breakage under the redemption recognition method 
this method records gift card breakage as revenue on a proportional basis over the redemption period based on our historical gift card breakage rate 
we determine the gift card breakage rate based on our historical redemption patterns 
as part of the normal sales cycle  we receive customer merchandise returns related to store and dtc sales 
to account for the financial impact of this process  we estimate future returns on previously sold merchandise 
reductions in sales and gross margin are recorded for estimated merchandise returns based on return history  current sales levels and projected future return levels 
evaluation of long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed periodically for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
if future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset are less than its carrying amount  an asset is determined to be impaired  and a loss is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
the fair value of an asset is estimated using estimated future cash flows of the asset discounted by a rate commensurate with the risk involved with such asset while incorporating marketplace assumptions 
the estimate of future cash flows requires management to make certain assumptions and to apply judgment  including forecasting future sales and the useful lives of the assets 
we exercise our best judgment based on the most current facts and circumstances surrounding our business when applying these impairment rules 
we establish our assumptions and arrive at the estimates used in these calculations based upon our historical experience  knowledge of the retail industry and by incorporating third party data  which we believe results in a reasonably accurate approximation of fair value 
nevertheless  changes in the assumptions used could have an impact on our assessment of recoverability 
for example  as it relates to the million write off of fixed assets for certain underperforming stores in fiscal  if we had decreased our forecast of future sales by throughout the forecast period or increased our discount rate by  our write off would have increased by less than million 

table of contents we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill at least annually based on a two step impairment test 
the first step compares the fair value of our reporting units with their carrying amounts  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount exceeds fair value  then the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of any impairment loss 
fair value is determined based on estimated future cash flows  discounted at a rate that approximates our cost of capital 
there are several significant assumptions and estimates used in the discounted cash flow model 
included among these are the estimates used to forecast cash flows over a year forecast period  including an estimate for overall sales growth based on assumptions with respect to future comparable store sales growth  changes in store counts and square footage growth rates 
we also estimate future gross margin and operating margin percentages 
the discount rate is estimated based on an approximation of our weighted average cost of capital formulated by reviewing assumptions used by marketplace participants  in order to calculate the present value of forecasted future cash flows 
lastly  our discounted cash flow model estimates future cash flows where appropriate beyond the year forecast period for purposes of the present value computation by applying a long term growth rate commensurate with an estimate of overall us economic growth 
with regard to the goodwill impairment test completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal  if we had assumed a weighted average cost of capital higher than the rate used in the goodwill impairment test  the estimated fair value of the chico s and wh bm reporting units would have decreased by approximately million and million  respectively 
nevertheless  even such reduced fair value amounts still would be greater than the respective carrying values of the respective reporting units and thus the second step of the goodwill impairment test still would not have been triggered 
conversely  if we had assumed a sales growth estimate lower throughout the forecast period than the rate used in our goodwill impairment test  the fair value of the chico s and wh bm reporting units would have decreased by approximately million and million  respectively 
again  however  even such reduced fair value amounts still would be greater than the respective carrying values of the respective reporting units and thus the second step of the goodwill impairment test still would not have been triggered 
currently  we believe that neither of our reporting units is at risk of failing the first step of goodwill impairment testing 
we evaluate our other intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis by comparing the fair value of the asset with its carrying value 
such estimates are subject to change and we may be required to recognize impairment losses in the future 
for example  with regard to our annual impairment test of the wh bm trademark intangible asset  if we had assumed a sales growth estimate lower throughout the forecast period than the rate used in its trademark impairment test  the fair value of the wh bm trademark would have decreased by approximately million 
conversely  an increase of in the discount rate would have decreased the fair value by approximately million 
in either case  the fair value of the wh bm trademark still would be greater than its carrying value and no impairment charge would have been recognized 
operating leases rent expense under store operating leases is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the leases 
landlord incentives  rent free periods  rent escalation clauses and other rental expenses are also amortized on a straight line basis over the terms of the leases  which includes the construction period and which is generally days prior to the store opening date when we generally begin improvements in preparation for our intended use 
tenant improvement allowances are recorded as a deferred lease credit within deferred liabilities and amortized as a reduction of rent expense over the term of the lease  which includes the construction period and one renewal when there is a significant economic penalty associated with non renewal 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for in accordance with authoritative guidance  which requires the use of the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
inherent in the measurement of deferred balances are certain judgments and interpretations of existing tax law and published 
table of contents guidance as applicable to our operations 
no valuation allowance has been provided for deferred tax assets  since management anticipates that the full amount of these assets should be realized in the future 
our effective tax rate considers management s judgment of expected tax liabilities within the various taxing jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax 
due to the substantial amounts involved and judgment necessary  we deem this policy could be critical to our financial statements 
we record amounts for uncertain tax positions that management believes are supportable  but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority 
consequently  changes in our assumptions and judgments could materially affect amounts recognized related to income tax uncertainties and may affect our results of operations or financial position 
historically  the variation of those estimates to observed results has been insignificant and  although possible  significant variation is not expected in the future 
we believe our assumptions for estimates continue to be reasonable  although actual results may have a positive or negative material impact on the balances of such tax positions 
at january  and january   we had approximately million and million reserved for uncertain tax positions  respectively 
a difference in the ultimate settlement amount of our uncertain tax positions versus our tax reserves recorded on january  would have affected net income and the related reserves by approximately million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our uncertain tax positions 
stock based compensation expense the calculation of stock based employee compensation expense involves estimates that require management s judgment 
these estimates include the fair value of each of the stock option awards granted  which is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
there are two significant inputs into the black scholes option pricing model expected volatility and expected term 
we estimate expected volatility based on the historical volatility of our stock over a term equal to the expected term of the option granted 
the expected term of stock option awards granted is derived from historical exercise experience under our stock option plans and represents the period of time that stock option awards granted are expected to be outstanding 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
however  a change of in the assumptions for expected volatility and expected term used to calculate the fair value of stock options granted during the fiscal year ended january  would have affected net income by approximately million for fiscal in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate  and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
in determining the portion of the stock based payment award that is ultimately expected to be earned  we derive forfeiture rates based on historical data 
in accordance with the authoritative guidance  we revise our forfeiture rates  when necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those originally estimated 
as a result  in the event that a grant s actual forfeiture rate is materially different from its estimate at the completion of the vesting period  the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we record in the current and prior periods 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on stock based compensation 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update asu which amends accounting standards codification asc topic  fair value measures and disclosures 
asu amends the asc to require disclosure of transfers into and out of level and level fair value measurements  and also require more detailed disclosure about the activity within level fair value measurements 
this guidance is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after december   except for requirements related to level disclosures  which are effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december  we do not expect that adoption of the remaining provisions of asu will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

our exposure to interest rate risk relates in part to our revolving line of credit with our bank  however  as of january   we did not have any outstanding borrowings on our line of credit and  given our current liquidity position  do not expect to utilize our line of credit in the foreseeable future except for the continuing use of the letter of credit facility portion thereof 
our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy which identifies allowable investments  specifies credit quality standards and limits the credit exposure of any single issuer

although the variable rate demand notes  totaling million  have long term maturity dates ranging from to  the interest rates generally reset weekly 
despite the long term nature of the underlying securities of the variable rate demand notes  we have the ability to quickly liquidate or put back these securities 
the remainder of the portfolio  as of january  consisted of million of securities with maturity dates less than one year and million with maturity dates over one year and less than two years 
we consider all available for sale securities  including those with maturity dates beyond months  as available to support current operational liquidity needs and therefore classify these securities as short term investments within current assets on the consolidated balance sheets 
as of january   an increase of basis points in interest rates would reduce the fair value of our marketable securities portfolio by approximately million 
conversely  a reduction of basis points in interest rates would increase the fair value of our marketable securities portfolio by approximately million
