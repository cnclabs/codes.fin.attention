details regarding the pending merger are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  acquisitions and dispositions of businesses and sales of other assets 
financial results 
net income attributable to duke energy was  million for the year ended december   as compared to  million for the year ended december  diluted earnings per share increased from per share for the year ended december  to for the year ended december   primarily due to the increase in net income for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in  as described further below 
net income for both of the years ended december  and was impacted by goodwill and other impairment charges of million and million  respectively  primarily related to the non regulated generation operations in the midwest 
income from continuing operation was  million for the year ended december  as compared to  million for the same period in total reportable segment ebit defined below in segment results section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations increased to  million in from  million in see results of operations below for a detailed discussion of the consolidated results of operations  as well as a detailed discussion of ebit results for each of duke energy s reportable business segments  as well as other 
areas of focus and accomplishments 
in  management was focused on controlling operations and maintenance expenses  maintaining operational excellence  continued modernization of infrastructure  competing effectively in ohio and investing in renewable energy 
controlling operations and maintenance expenses 
in order to address the impact of the weakened economy on sales volumes leading into management was focused on controlling costs with the goal that operations and maintenance expenses  net of deferrals and cost recovery riders  would be flat compared to  due largely to sustainable reductions achieved during  as well as certain initiatives such as a voluntary severance program and office consolidation 
record temperatures and related high load demands during the year resulted in increased expenses in order to maintain duke energy s generation fleet and transmission and distribution systems 
due to the impact of these pressures  operations and maintenance expenses  net of deferrals and cost recovery riders  were slightly higher than maintaining operational excellence 
duke energy assesses operational excellence using a number of quantitative measures including but not limited to capacity factor  commercial availability  equivalent availability  system average interruption frequency index and system part ii average interruption duration index depending on the component of the business being evaluated 
during duke energy businesses met or exceeded most quantitative measures of operational excellence 
duke energy s nuclear fleet demonstrated a record capacity factor at approximately 
in addition commercial power s non regulated coal and gas generation assets delivered record generation volumes 
continued modernization of infrastructure 
duke energy s strategy for meeting customer demand  while building a sustainable business that allows its customers and its shareholders to prosper in a carbon constrained environment  includes significant commitments to renewable energy  customer energy efficiency  advanced nuclear power  advanced clean coal and high efficiency natural gas electric generating plants  and retirement of older less efficient coal fired power plants 
due to the likelihood of upcoming environmental regulations  including carbon legislation  air pollutant regulation by the us environmental protection agency epa and coal regulation  duke energy has been focused on modernizing its generation fleet in preparation for a low carbon future 
duke energy plans to invest approximately billion in four key generation fleet modernization projects with approximately  mws of capacity within it us franchised electric and gas segment 
during  duke energy continued the construction of cliffside unit in north carolina and the edwardsport igcc plant in indiana and both of these projects are approximately at december  both are scheduled to be placed in service during once in service  duke energy will begin retiring older  less efficient coal and gas fired units 
additionally  duke energy has continued construction on its mw combined cycle natural gas fired generating facilities at its existing buck and dan river steam stations 
the buck facility is approximately complete and is scheduled to be placed in service in the dan river facility is in the early stages of construction and is scheduled to be placed in service in duke energy invested billion in the above generation fleet modernization projects in and billion since the inception of these projects 
competing effectively in ohio 
while commercial power s operations continue to be impacted by the competitive markets in ohio  duke energy has been successful in preserving margin for its shareholders through duke energy retail sales  llc duke energy retail 
retail customer switching levels increased to approximately at december  from approximately at december  however  through duke energy retail  commercial power acquired approximately of the switched load by offering customers a choice between discounts to the electric security plan esp price or fixed price per kwh arrangements 
when factoring in the duke energy retail activity  commercial power s net customer switching was approximately at december  compared to at december   although those customers acquired by duke energy retail were at lower margins than customers served under the esp 
additionally  duke energy retail has been successful in acquiring new customers outside commercial power s esp load territory 
on november   duke energy ohio filed for approval of its next standard service offer sso to replace the existing esp that expires on december  the filing seeks approval of a market rate offer mro through which generation supply is ultimately procured through a competitive solicitation format 
investing in renewable energy 
during commercial power added net mw of renewable energy generation capacity  including duke energy s first operating solar projects  bringing its total operating renewable energy generation capacity to  net mw 
commercial power invested million  net of grants  in its renewable energy construction program in non core businesses 
in december  duke energy completed the formation of a joint venture for dukenet communications  llc dukenet with investment funds managed by alinda capital partners llc alinda and the closing of a million senior secured credit for dukenet 
alinda acquired a interest in dukenet in exchange for million of cash 
the new five year credit facility will provide dukenet with capital for continued expansion of its telecommunications network  future acquisitions and general corporate purposes 
duke energy recorded a pre tax gain of million related to the disposition of duke energy s interest in dukenet  as well as the re measurement to fair value of duke energy s retained non controlling interest 
in december  duke energy completed the sale of its equity investment in q comm corporation q comm to windstream corp 
windstream 
the sale resulted in million in net proceeds  including million of windstream common shares and a million pre tax gain 
duke energy objectives and beyond 
duke energy will focus on obtaining approval of the merger with progress energy  continued modernization of infrastructure  executing on rate case filings  cost control efforts and achieving a constructive outcome to the sso filing in ohio 
obtaining approval of the merger with progress energy 
completion of the merger is conditioned upon  among other things  shareholder approval of both companies as well as expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act of and approval to the extent required by the ferc  fcc  ncuc  pscsc  fpsc  puco  iurc  kpsc and the nrc 
duke energy plans to file a registration statement on form s during the first quarter of and expects shareholder meetings for both duke energy and progress energy to be held in the second or third quarter of duke energy will file merger applications with the ncuc  and kpsc during the first quarter of ferc and nrc filings will be made during the first quarter of duke energy will file for approval of combined operational control of generation facilities with the pscsc in the third quarter of other required filings are expected to be made during the second quarter of duke energy anticipates all necessary approvals will be obtained by the end of  however no assurances can be given as to the timing of the satisfaction of all closing conditions or that all required approvals will be received 
planned and potential rate cases 
the majority of future earnings are anticipated to be contributed from us franchised electric and gas usfe g  which consists of duke energy s regulated businesses that currently own a capacity of approximately  mw of generation 
the regulated generation portfolio consists of a mix of coal  nuclear  natural gas and hydroelectric generation  with the substantial majority of all of the sales of electricity coming from coal and nuclear generation facilities 
the rate case outcomes reached in the various jurisdictions in will continue to have a positive impact on usfe g s earnings 
duke energy carolinas plans to file rate cases in north carolina and south carolina during and duke energy indiana plans to file a rate case in duke energy ohio is evaluating the need for electric distribution and gas rate cases in or duke energy kentucky is evaluating the need for an electric rate case in these planned rates cases are needed to recover investments in duke energy s ongoing infrastructure modernization projects and operating costs 
planning for and obtaining favorable outcomes from these regulatory proceedings are a key factor in achieving duke energy s long term growth assumptions 
continued modernization of infrastructure 
duke energy anticipates total capital expenditures of billion to billion in the majority of this amount is expected to be spent on committed projects  including base load power plants to meet long term growth in customer demand and to modernize the generation fleet  ongoing environmental projects  and nuclear fuel 
approximately billion to billion of these expenditures are principally related to duke energy s ongoing generation fleet modernization projects 
duke energy is committed to adding base load capacity at a reasonable price while modernizing the current generation facilities by replacing older  less efficient plants with cleaner  more efficient plants 
duke energy will continue to focus on managing costs related to the edwardsport igcc and will work for a constructive outcome related to the cost increase proceedings 
in addition to its ongoing edwardsport igcc plant  cliffside unit and buck and dan river gas fired generation projects  duke energy is evaluating the potential construction of the william states lee iii nuclear power plant in cherokee county  south carolina 
as these major generation fleet modernization projects are completed in and the level of capital spending related to system growth will begin to decline 
this will provide duke energy with the ability to direct capital to environmental projects where it estimates that it could spend as much as billion over the next ten years 
as the majority of duke energy s anticipated future capital expenditures are related to its regulated operations  a risk to duke energy is the ability to recover costs related to such expansion in a timely manner 
energy legislation passed in north carolina and south carolina in part ii provides  among other things  mechanisms for duke energy to recover financing costs for new nuclear or coal base load generation during the construction phase 
duke energy has received approval for nearly million of future federal tax credits related to costs to be incurred for the modernization of cliffside unit  as well as the igcc plant in indiana 
in addition  duke energy has received general assurances from the ncuc that the north carolina allocable portion of development costs associated with the william states lee iii nuclear station will be recoverable through a future rate case proceeding as long as the costs are deemed prudent and reasonable 
through several separate orders  the ncuc and pscsc have deemed duke energy s decision to incur project development and pre construction costs for the project as reasonable and prudent through december  and up to an aggregate maximum amount of million 
on november  and january   duke energy filed amended project development applications with the ncuc and pscsc  respectively 
these applications request approval of duke energy s decision to continue to incur project development and pre construction costs for the project through december  and up to million 
duke energy does not anticipate beginning construction of the proposed nuclear power plant without adequate assurance of cost recovery from the state legislators or regulators 
duke energy is seeking joint venture partners for the william states lee iii nuclear station by issuing options to purchase an ownership interest in the plant 
in summary  duke energy is coordinating its future capital expenditure requirements with regulatory initiatives in order to ensure adequate and timely cost recovery while continuing to provide low cost energy to its customers 
cost control efforts 
since the beginning of the economic downturn in  duke energy was successful in holding operations and maintenance expenses  net of deferrals and cost recovery riders  flat through however  the record temperatures and related high load demands experienced during resulted in an increase in duke energy s operations and maintenance expenses  net of deferrals and cost recovery riders  in duke energy expects continued costs pressures in due to additional maintenance expenses related to new assets  additional planned outages at nuclear stations  employee benefit costs and inflation 
as a result of these pressures  duke energy expects operations and maintenance expenses  net of deferrals and cost recovery riders  to increase in duke energy expects the increase to be modest from the beginning of the economic downturn in ohio sso filing 
the current regulatory environment in ohio makes it difficult for duke energy to reduce risk and earn consistent  reasonable returns on its primarily coal fired generation portfolio in ohio 
duke energy believes its mro filing best positions its primarily coal fired generation portfolio in ohio for the long term under the current regulatory construct 
duke energy s proposed mro provides the flexibility to deliver competitive and fair rates to customers  provides mechanisms to earn more adequate returns on investments in ohio  and better balances risks and rewards to encourage future investments in ohio 
on february   the puco stated that duke energy ohio did not file an application for a five year mro as required under ohio statute 
as a result  the puco ordered that the case cannot proceed as filed 
duke energy ohio is evaluating its options and plans to file a revised sso in early second quarter of in conjunction with the initial mro filing  duke energy plans to file a request to transfer the primarily coal fired generation portfolio to an affiliate of duke energy ohio in order to provide more flexibility around those assets in the future 
economic factors for duke energy s business 
duke energy s business model provides diversification between stable regulated businesses like usfe g  and the traditionally higher growth businesses like the unregulated portion of commercial power s operations and international energy 
duke energy s businesses can be negatively affected by sustained downturns or sluggishness in the economy  including low market prices of commodities  all of which are beyond duke energy s control  and could impair duke energy s ability to meet its goals for and beyond 
declines in demand for electricity as a result of economic downturns reduce overall electricity sales and have the potential to lessen duke energy s cash flows  especially as industrial customers reduce production and  thus  consumption of electricity 
a weakening economy could also impact duke energy s customer s ability to pay  causing increased delinquencies  slowing collections and lead to higher than normal levels of accounts receivables  bad debts and financing requirements 
a portion of usfe g business risk is mitigated by its regulated allowable rates of return and recovery of fuel costs under fuel adjustment clauses 
the current esp in ohio  which expires in december  also helps mitigate a portion of the risk associated with certain portions of commercial power s generation operations by providing mechanisms for recovery of certain costs associated with  among other things  fuel and purchased power for esp load customers 
if negative market conditions should persist over time and estimated cash flows over the lives of duke energy s individual assets  including goodwill  do not exceed the carrying value of those individual assets  asset impairments may occur in the future under existing accounting rules and diminish results of operations 
a change in management s intent about the use of individual assets held for use versus held for sale could also result in impairments or losses 
duke energy s goals can also be substantially at risk due to the regulation of its businesses 
duke energy s businesses in the us are subject to regulation on the federal and state level 
regulations  applicable to the electric power industry  have a significant impact on the nature of the businesses and the manner in which they operate 
as noted above  duke energy plans to file various rate cases during and in addition  duke energy indiana file a motion with the iurc proposing an updated procedural schedule to address various pending matters related to the edwardsport igcc 
the outcome of any one or combination of these proceedings could have a significant impact on duke energy s earnings 
new legislation and changes to regulations are ongoing  including anticipated carbon legislation  and duke energy cannot predict the future course of changes in the regulatory or political environment or the ultimate effect that any such future changes will have on its business 
duke energy s earnings are impacted by fluctuations in commodity prices 
exposure to commodity prices generates higher earnings volatility in the unregulated businesses 
to mitigate these risks  duke energy enters into derivative instruments to effectively hedge some  but not all  known exposures 
additionally  duke energy s investments and projects located outside of the united states expose duke energy to risks related to laws of other countries  taxes  economic conditions  fluctuations in currency rates  political conditions and policies of foreign governments 
changes in these factors are difficult to predict and may impact duke energy s future results 
duke energy also relies on access to both short term money markets and longer term capital markets as a source of liquidity for capital requirements not met by cash flow from operations 
an inability to access capital at competitive rates or at all could adversely affect duke energy s ability to implement its strategy 
market disruptions or a downgrade of duke energy s credit rating may increase its cost of borrowing or adversely affect its ability to access one or more sources of liquidity

year ended december  as compared to december  operating revenues 
the increase was driven primarily by a million increase in net retail pricing and rate riders primarily due to new retail base rates implemented in north carolina and south carolina in the first quarter of resulting from the rate cases  an ohio electric distribution rate increase in july  and a kentucky gas rate increase in january  a million increase in sales to retail customers due to favorable weather conditions in compared to for the carolinas and midwest  weather statistics for both heating degree days and cooling degree days in were favorable compared to the year had the most cooling degree days on record in the duke energy carolinas service area dating back to  a million increase in fuel revenues including emission allowances driven primarily by increased demand from electric retail customers resulting from favorable weather conditions  and higher fuel rates for electric retail customers in north carolina  partially offset by lower fuel rates for electric retail customers in the midwest and south carolina  and lower natural gas fuel rates in ohio and kentucky 
fuel revenues represent sales to retail and wholesale customers  a million net increase in wholesale power revenues  net of sharing  primarily due to increases in charges for capacity  increased sales volumes due to weather conditions in and the addition of new customers served under long term contracts  and a million increase in weather adjusted sales volumes to electric retail customers reflecting increased demand  primarily in the industrial sector  and slight growth in the number of residential and general service electric customers in the usfe g service territory 
the number of electric residential customers in has increased by approximately  in the carolinas and by approximately  in the midwest compared to operating expenses 
the increase was driven primarily by a million increase in fuel expense including purchased power and natural gas purchases for resale primarily due to higher volume of coal and gas used in electric generation resulting from favorable weather conditions  and higher coal prices  partially offset by lower natural gas prices to full service retail customers  a million increase in operating and maintenance expenses primarily due to costs related to the implementation of the save a watt program  higher customer service operations costs  higher benefit costs  higher nuclear  power and gas delivery maintenance costs  higher outage costs at fossil generation stations  and the disallowance in of a portion of previously deferred costs in ohio related to the hurricane ike wind storm  partially offset by overall lower storm costs  including the establishment of a regulatory asset to defer previously recognized costs related to an ice storm in indiana in early a million increase in depreciation and amortization due primarily to increases in depreciation as a result of additional capital spending and amortization of regulatory assets  and a million disallowance charge related to the edwardsport igcc plant that is currently under construction 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  regulatory matters  for additional information 
gains on sales of other assets and other  net 
the decrease is attributable primarily to lower net gains on sales of emission allowances in compared to other income and expenses  net 
the increase resulted primarily from a higher equity component of afudc from additional capital spending for increased construction expenditures related to new generation and higher deferred returns 
ebit 
as discussed above  the increase resulted primarily from overall net higher retail pricing and rate riders  favorable weather  higher equity component of afudc  higher wholesale power revenues  and higher weather adjusted sales volumes 
these positive impacts part ii were partially offset by higher operating and maintenance expenses  increased depreciation and amortization  and the disallowance charge related to the edwardsport igcc plant that is currently under construction 
matters impacting future us franchised electric and gas results results of usfe g are impacted by the completion of its major generation fleet modernization projects 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  regulatory matters  for a discussion of the significant increase in the estimated cost of the mw integrated gasification combined cycle igcc plant at duke energy indiana s edwardsport generating station 
duke energy carolinas plans to file rate cases in north carolina and south carolina during and duke energy indiana plans to file a rate case in duke energy ohio is evaluating the need for electric distribution and gas rate cases in or duke energy kentucky is evaluating the need for an electric rate case in these planned rates cases are needed to recover investments in duke energy s ongoing infrastructure modernization projects and operating costs 
usfe g s earnings could be adversely impacted if any of these rate cases are denied or delayed by the various state regulatory commissions 
usfe g evaluates the carrying amount of its recorded goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of august and performs interim impairment tests if a triggering event occurs that indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
for further information on key assumptions that impact usfe g s goodwill impairment assessments  see critical accounting policy for goodwill impairment assessments 
as of the august impairment analysis  the fair value of the ohio transmission and distribution ohio t d reporting unit exceeded its carrying value at duke energy  therefore no goodwill impairment charge was recorded 
however  the fair value of the ohio t d reporting unit  which has a goodwill balance of million as of december   exceeded its carrying value by less than 
management is continuing to monitor the impact of recent market and economic events to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the ohio t d reporting unit has been impaired 
should any such triggering events or circumstances occur in that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the ohio t d reporting unit below its carrying value  management would again perform an interim impairment test of the ohio t d goodwill and it is possible that a goodwill impairment charge could be recorded as a result of this test 
potential circumstances that could have a negative effect on the fair value of the ohio t d reporting unit include additional declines in load volume forecasts  changes in the weighted average cost of capital wacc and the equity valuations of peer companies  changes in the timing and or recovery of and on investments in smartgrid technology  and the success of future rate case filings

duke energy indiana s earnings could be adversely impacted if any of this rate case is denied or delayed by the iurc 
part ii critical accounting policies and estimates the application of accounting policies and estimates is an important process that continues to develop as duke energy s operations change and accounting guidance evolves 
duke energy has identified a number of critical accounting policies and estimates that require the use of significant estimates and judgments 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on other various assumptions that it believes are reasonable at the time of application 
the estimates and judgments may change as time passes and more information about duke energy s environment becomes available 
if estimates and judgments are different than the actual amounts recorded  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to take into consideration the new information 
duke energy discusses its critical accounting policies and estimates and other significant accounting policies with senior members of management and the audit committee  as appropriate 
duke energy s critical accounting policies and estimates are discussed below 
regulatory accounting certain of duke energy s regulated operations primarily the majority of us franchised electric and gas and certain portions of commercial power meet the criteria for application of regulatory accounting treatment 
as a result  duke energy records assets and liabilities that result from the regulated ratemaking process that would not be recorded under gaap in the us for non regulated entities 
regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs that have been deferred because such costs are probable of future recovery in customer rates 
regulatory liabilities generally represent obligations to make refunds to customers for previous collections for costs that either are not likely to or have yet to be incurred 
management continually assesses whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as applicable regulatory environment changes  historical regulatory treatment for similar costs in duke energy s jurisdictions  recent rate orders to other regulated entities  and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation 
based on this continual assessment  management believes the existing regulatory assets are probable of recovery 
this assessment reflects the current political and regulatory climate at the state and federal levels  and is subject to change in the future 
if future recovery of costs ceases to be probable  the asset write offs would be required to be recognized in operating income 
additionally  the regulatory agencies can provide flexibility in the manner and timing of the depreciation of property  plant and equipment  recognition of nuclear decommissioning costs and amortization of regulatory assets or may disallow recovery of all or a portion of certain assets 
total regulatory assets were  million as of december  and  million as of december  total regulatory liabilities were  million as of december  and  million as of december  for further information  see note to the consolidated financial statements  regulatory matters 
in order to apply regulatory accounting treatment and record regulatory assets and liabilities  certain criteria must be met 
in determining whether the criteria are met for its operations  management makes significant judgments  including determining whether revenue rates for services provided to customers are subject to approval by an independent  third party regulator  whether the regulated rates are designed to recover specific costs of providing the regulated service  and a determination of whether  in view of the demand for the regulated services and the level of competition  it is reasonable to assume that rates set at levels that will recover the operations costs can be charged to and collected from customers 
this final criterion requires consideration of anticipated changes in levels of demand or competition  direct and indirect  during the recovery period for any capitalized costs 
if facts and circumstances change so that a portion of duke energy s regulated operations meet all of the scope criteria when such criteria had not been previously met  regulatory accounting treatment would be reapplied to all or a separable portion of the operations 
such reapplication includes adjusting the balance sheet for amounts that meet the definition of a regulatory asset or regulatory liability 
the regulatory accounting rules require recognition of a loss if it becomes probable that part of the cost of a plant under construction or a recently completed plant will be disallowed for ratemaking purposes and a reasonable estimate of the amount of the disallowance can be made 
such assessments can require significant judgment by management regarding matters such as the ultimate cost of a plant under construction  regulatory recovery implications  etc 
as discussed in note  regulatory matters  during duke energy indiana recorded a million disallowance charge related to the igcc plant currently under construction in edwardsport  indiana 
management will continue to assess matters as the construction of the plant and the related regulatory proceedings continue  and further charges could be required in or beyond  commercial power owns  operates and manages power plants in the midwestern united states 
commercial power s generation operations  excluding renewable energy generation assets  consists of primarily coal fired generation assets located in ohio which are dedicated under the duke energy ohio electric security plan esp and gas fired non regulated generation assets which are dispatched into wholesale markets 
the primarily coal fired generation assets also sell power into wholesale markets to the extent there is excess generation above the amount needed to fulfill commercial power s obligations under the esp 
the wholesale generation operations do not qualify for regulatory accounting treatment as these operations do not meet the scope criteria 
commercial power applies regulatory accounting treatment to certain portions of its esp operations as the rate structure for these portions is designed to recover the specific costs of these components of the esp 
despite other portions of the esp operations not qualifying for regulatory accounting treatment  all of commercial power s esp operations rates are subject to approval by the puco  and thus these operations are referred to herein as commercial power s regulated operations 
generation is a competitive business in ohio and retail customers have the ability to switch to alternative suppliers for their electric generation service 
as customers switch  there is a risk that some or all of commercial power s regulatory assets will not be recovered through the established riders 
duke energy monitors the amount of retail customers that have switched to alternative suppliers when assessing the recoverability of its regulatory assets established for its esp operations 
as discussed in note  regulatory matters  duke energy ohio s esp expires on december  in november  duke energy ohio filed a request to serve its retail customers under a market rate offer mro  effective january  duke energy will evaluate whether the continued application of regulatory accounting for commercial power s operations is appropriate once the outcome of the mro filing is known 
no other operations within commercial power  and no operations within the international energy business segment  qualify for regulatory accounting treatment 
the substantial majority of us franchised electric and gas s operations qualify for regulatory accounting treatment and thus its costs of business and related revenues can result in the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities  as described above 
goodwill impairment assessments at december  and  duke energy had goodwill balances of  million and  million  respectively 
at december   the goodwill balances by segment were  million at us franchised electric and gas  million at commercial power  and million at international energy 
the majority of duke energy s goodwill relates to the acquisition of cinergy in april  whose assets are primarily included in the us franchised electric and gas and commercial power segments 
commercial power also has million of goodwill that resulted from the september acquisition of catamount  a leading wind power company located in rutland  vermont 
as of the acquisition date  duke energy allocates goodwill to a reporting unit  which duke energy defines as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment 
part ii duke energy recorded impairments of million and million related to commercial power s non regulated midwest generation reporting unit in and duke energy ohio recorded impairments of million and million related to commercial power s non regulated midwest generation reporting unit in and subsequent to the impairment charges  there is no recorded amount of goodwill at commercial power s non regulated midwest generation reporting unit 
these impairment charges are recorded in goodwill and other impairment charges on duke energy s consolidated statement of operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  goodwill  intangible assets and impairments for further information regarding the factors impacting the valuation of commercial power s non regulated generation reporting unit 
duke energy determined that no other goodwill impairments existed in  and as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  goodwill  intangible assets and impairments  duke energy is required to test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually and more frequently if events or circumstances occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
duke energy evaluates the carrying amount of its recorded goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of august and performs interim impairment tests if a triggering event occurs that indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
the analysis of the potential impairment of goodwill requires a two step process 
step one of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of reporting units with their carrying values  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit s fair value  step two must be performed to determine the amount  if any  of the goodwill impairment loss 
if the carrying amount is less than fair value  further testing of goodwill is not performed 
step two of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill against the carrying value of the goodwill 
under step two  determining the implied fair value of goodwill requires the valuation of a reporting unit s identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination on the testing date 
the difference between the fair value of the entire reporting unit as determined in step one and the net fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities represents the implied fair value of goodwill 
the goodwill impairment charge  if any  would be the difference between the carrying amount of goodwill and the implied fair value of goodwill upon the completion of step two 
for purposes of the step one analyses  determination of the reporting units fair values is based on a combination of the income approach  which estimates the fair value of duke energy s reporting units based on discounted future cash flows  and the market approach  which estimates the fair value of duke energy s reporting units based on market comparables within the utility and energy industries 
key assumptions used in the income approach analyses for the us franchised electric and gas reporting units include  but are not limited to  the use of an appropriate discount rate  estimated future cash flows and estimated run rates of operation  maintenance  and general and administrative costs  and expectations of returns on equity that will be achieved 
in estimating cash flows  duke energy incorporates expected growth rates  regulatory stability and ability to renew contracts  as well as other factors  into its revenue and expense forecasts 
estimated future cash flows under the income approach are based to a large extent on duke energy s internal business plan  and adjusted as appropriate for duke energy s views of market participant assumptions 
duke energy s internal business plan reflects management s assumptions related to customer usage and attrition based on internal data and economic data obtained from third party sources  projected commodity pricing data and potential changes in environmental regulations 
the business plan assumes the occurrence of certain events in the future  such as the outcome of future rate filings  future approved rates of returns on equity  anticipated earnings returns related to significant future capital investments  continued recovery of cost of service and the renewal of certain contracts 
management also makes assumptions regarding the run rate of operation  maintenance and general and administrative costs based on the expected outcome of the aforementioned events 
should the actual outcome of some or all of these assumptions differ significantly from the current assumptions  revisions to current cash flow assumptions could cause the fair value of duke energy s reporting units to be significantly different in future periods 
one of the most significant assumptions that duke energy utilizes in determining the fair value of its reporting units under the income approach is the discount rate applied to the estimated future cash flows 
management determines the appropriate discount rate for each of its reporting units based on the wacc for each individual reporting unit 
the wacc takes into account both the pre tax cost of debt and cost of equity a major component of the cost of equity is the current risk free rate on twenty year us treasury bonds 
duke energy considered implied wacc s for certain peer companies in determining the appropriate wacc rates to use in its analysis 
as each reporting unit has a different risk profile based on the nature of its operations  including factors such as regulation  the wacc for each reporting unit may differ 
accordingly  the waccs were adjusted  as appropriate  to account for company specific risk premiums 
for example  transmission and distribution reporting units generally would have a lower company specific risk premium as they do not have the higher level of risk associated with owning and operating generation assets nor do they have significant construction risk or risk associated with potential future carbon legislation or pending epa regulations 
the discount rates used for calculating the fair values as of august  for each of duke energy s domestic reporting units were commensurate with the risks associated with each reporting unit and ranged from to 
for duke energy s international operations  a base discount rate of was used  with specific adders used for each separate jurisdiction in which international energy operates to reflect the differing risk profiles of the jurisdictions and countries 
this resulted in discount rates for the august  goodwill impairment test for the international operations ranging from to 
another significant assumption that duke energy utilizes in determining the fair value of its reporting units under the income approach is the long term growth rate of the businesses for purposes of determining a terminal value at the end of the discrete forecast period 
a long term growth rate of three percent was used in the valuations of all of the us franchised electric and gas reporting units  reflecting the median long term inflation rate and the significant capital investments forecasted for all of the us franchised electric and gas reporting units 
a long term growth rate of two percent was used in the valuation of the commercial power non regulated midwest generation reporting unit given the finite lives of the unregulated generation power plants and current absence of plans to reinvest in the unregulated generation assets 
these underlying assumptions and estimates are made as of a point in time  subsequent changes  particularly changes in the discount rates or growth rates inherent in management s estimates of future cash flows  could result in future impairment charges 
management continues to remain alert for any indicators that the fair value of a reporting unit could be below book value and will assess goodwill for impairment as appropriate 
in the second quarter of  goodwill for us franchised electric and gas s ohio t d reporting unit ohio t d was tested at this interim date 
the fair value of the ohio t d reporting unit is impacted by a multitude of factors  including current and forecasted customer demand  discount rates  valuation of peer companies  and regulatory and legislative developments 
management periodically updates the load forecasts to reflect current trends and expectations based on the current environment and future assumptions 
the spring and summer load forecast indicated that load will not return to weather normalized levels for several more years 
based on the results of the second quarter impairment analysis  the fair value of the ohio t d reporting unit was million below its book value at duke energy ohio and million higher than its book value at duke energy 
accordingly  this goodwill impairment charge was only recorded by duke energy ohio 
as of december   the ohio t d reporting unit had a goodwill balance of approximately million at duke energy and million at duke energy ohio 
potential circumstances that could have a negative effect on the fair value of the ohio t d reporting unit part ii include additional declines in load volume forecasts  changes in the wacc  changes in the timing and or recovery of and on investments in smartgrid technology  and the success of future rate case filings 
as of december   the fair value of commercial power s renewables reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 
as an overall test of the reasonableness of the estimated fair values of the reporting units  duke energy reconciled the combined fair value estimates of its reporting units to its market capitalization as of august  the reconciliation confirmed that the fair values were reasonably representative of market views when applying a reasonable control premium to the market capitalization 
additionally  duke energy would perform an interim impairment assessment should any events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
subsequent to august   management did not identify any indicators of potential impairment that required an update to the annual impairment test 
the majority of duke energy s business is in environments that are either fully or partially rate regulated 
in such environments  revenue requirements are adjusted periodically by regulators based on factors including levels of costs  sales volumes and costs of capital 
accordingly  duke energy s regulated utilities operate to some degree with a buffer from the direct effects  positive or negative  of significant swings in market or economic conditions 
however  management will continue to monitor changes in the business  as well as overall market conditions and economic factors that could require additional impairment tests 
long lived asset impairment assessments property  plant and equipment is stated at the lower of historical cost less accumulated depreciation or fair value  if impaired 
duke energy evaluates property  plant and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
the determination of whether an impairment has occurred is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets  as compared with the carrying value of the assets 
performing an impairment evaluation involves a significant degree of estimation and judgment in areas such as identifying circumstances that indicate an impairment may exist  identifying and grouping affected assets  and developing the undiscounted and discounted future cash flows used to estimate fair value in the absence of market based value associated with the asset 
additionally  determining fair values requires probability weighting the cash flows to reflect expectations about possible variations in their amounts or timing and the selection of an appropriate discount rate 
although cash flow estimates are based on relevant information available at the time the estimates are made  estimates of future cash flows are  by nature  highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results 
if an impairment has occurred  the amount of the impairment recognized is determined by estimating the fair value of the assets and recording a loss if the carrying value is greater than the fair value 
for assets identified as held for sale  the carrying value is compared to the estimated fair value less the cost to sell in order to determine if an impairment loss is required 
until the assets are disposed of  their estimated fair value is re evaluated when circumstances or events change 
as discussed further in note to the consolidated financial statements  goodwill  intangible assets and impairments  commercial power recorded million of pre tax impairment charges related to certain generating assets and emission allowances primarily associated with these generation assets in the midwest to write down the value of these assets to their estimated fair value 
the generation assets that were subject to this impairment charge were those coal fired generating assets that do not have certain environmental emissions control equipment  causing these generation assets to be potentially heavily impacted by the epa s proposed rules on emissions of nox and nox 
these impairment charges are recorded in goodwill and other impairment charges on duke energy s consolidated statement of operations 
revenue recognition revenues on sales of electricity and gas are recognized when either the service is provided or the product is delivered 
operating revenues include unbilled electric and gas revenues earned when service has been delivered but not billed by the end of the accounting period 
unbilled retail revenues are estimated by applying an average revenue per kilowatt hour kwh or per mcf for all customer classes to the number of estimated kwh or mcfs delivered but not billed 
unbilled wholesale energy revenues are calculated by applying the contractual rate per megawatt hour mwh to the number of estimated mwh delivered but not yet billed 
unbilled wholesale demand revenues are calculated by applying the contractual rate per mw to the mw volume delivered but not yet billed 
the amount of unbilled revenues can vary significantly from period to period as a result of numerous factors  including seasonality  weather  customer usage patterns and customer mix 
in accordance with new accounting rules effective on january   duke energy began consolidating cinergy receivables company  llc cinergy receivables 
accordingly  unbilled revenues which had been included in the sale of receivables to cinergy receivables prior to the effective date of the new accounting rules  and thus not reflected on duke energy s consolidated balance sheets  are now included in receivables on duke energy s consolidated balance sheets 
at december  and  duke energy had million and million  respectively  of unbilled revenues within restricted receivables of variable interest entities and receivables on their respective consolidated balance sheets 
accounting for loss contingencies duke energy is involved in certain legal and environmental matters that arise in the normal course of business 
in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements  management makes judgments regarding the future outcome of contingent events and records a loss contingency when it is determined that it is probable that a loss has occurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
management regularly reviews current information available to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required 
estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple forecasts and scenarios that often depend on judgments about potential actions by third parties  such as federal  state and local courts and other regulators 
contingent liabilities are often resolved over long periods of time 
amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may differ from the actual outcome once the contingency is resolved  which could have a material impact on future results of operations  financial position and cash flows of duke energy 
duke energy has experienced numerous claims for indemnification and medical cost reimbursement relating to damages for bodily injuries alleged to have arisen from the exposure to or use of asbestos in connection with construction and maintenance activities conducted by duke energy carolinas on its electric generation plants prior to amounts recognized as asbestos related reserves related to duke energy carolinas in the respective consolidated balance sheets totaled million and million as of december  and december   respectively  and are classified in other within deferred credits and other liabilities and other within current liabilities 
these reserves are based upon the minimum amount in duke energy carolinas best estimate of the range of loss for current and future asbestos claims through management believes that it is possible there will be additional claims filed against duke energy carolinas after in light of the uncertainties inherent in a longer term forecast  management does not believe that they can reasonably estimate the indemnity and medical costs that might be incurred after related to such potential claims 
asbestos related loss estimates incorporate anticipated inflation  if applicable  and are recorded on an undiscounted basis 
these reserves are based upon current estimates and are subject to greater uncertainty as the projection period lengthens 
a significant upward or downward trend in the number of claims filed  the nature of the alleged injury  and the average cost of part ii resolving each such claim could change our estimated liability  as could any substantial adverse or favorable verdict at trial 
a federal legislative solution  further state tort reform or structured settlement transactions could also change the estimated liability 
given the uncertainties associated with projecting matters into the future and numerous other factors outside our control  management believes that it is possible duke energy carolinas may incur asbestos liabilities in excess of the recorded reserves 
duke energy has a third party insurance policy to cover certain losses related to duke energy carolinas asbestos related injuries and damages above an aggregate self insured retention of million 
duke energy carolinas cumulative payments began to exceed the self insurance retention on its insurance policy during the second quarter of future payments up to the policy limit will be reimbursed by duke energy s third party insurance carrier 
the insurance policy limit for potential future insurance recoveries for indemnification and medical cost claim payments is  million in excess of the self insured retention 
insurance recoveries of million and million related to this policy are classified in the consolidated balance sheets in other within investments and other assets and receivables as of december  and  respectively 
duke energy is not aware of any uncertainties regarding the legal sufficiency of insurance claims 
management believes the insurance recovery asset is probable of recovery as the insurance carrier continues to have a strong financial strength rating 
for further information  see note to the consolidated financial statements  commitments and contingencies 
accounting for income taxes significant management judgment is required in determining duke energy s provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against duke energy s net deferred tax assets  if any 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the book basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the probability of realizing deferred tax assets is based on forecasts of future taxable income and the use of tax planning that could impact the ability to realize deferred tax assets 
if future utilization of deferred tax assets is uncertain  a valuation allowance may be recorded against certain deferred tax assets 
in assessing the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets  management considers estimates of the amount and character of future taxable income 
actual income taxes could vary from estimated amounts due to the impacts of various items  including changes to income tax laws  duke energy s forecasted financial condition and results of operations in future periods  as well as results of audits and examinations of filed tax returns by taxing authorities 
although management believes current estimates are reasonable  actual results could differ from these estimates 
significant judgment is also required in computing duke energy s quarterly effective tax rate etr 
etr calculations are revised each quarter based on the best full year tax assumptions available at that time  including  but not limited to  income levels  deductions and credits 
in accordance with interim tax reporting rules  a tax expense or benefit is recorded every quarter to adjust for the difference in tax expense computed based on the actual year to date etr versus the forecasted annual etr 
duke energy recognizes tax benefits for positions taken or expected to be taken on tax returns  including the decision to exclude certain income or transactions from a return  when a more likely than not threshold is met for a tax position and management believes that the position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities 
duke energy records the largest amount of the tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon settlement 
management evaluates each position based solely on the technical merits and facts and circumstances of the position  assuming the position will be examined by a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information 
significant management judgment is required to determine recognition thresholds and the related amount of tax benefits to be recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
management reevaluates tax positions each period in which new information about recognition or measurement becomes available 
the portion of the tax benefit which is uncertain is disclosed in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements 
undistributed foreign earnings associated with international energy s operations are considered indefinitely reinvested  thus no us tax is recorded on such earnings 
this assertion is based on management s determination that the cash held in international energy s foreign jurisdictions is not needed to fund the operations of its us operations and that international energy either has invested or has intentions to reinvest such earnings 
while management currently intends to indefinitely reinvest all of international energy s unremitted earnings  should circumstances change  duke energy may need to record additional income tax expense in the period in which such determination changes 
the cumulative undistributed earnings as of december  on which duke energy has not provided deferred us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes is billion 
the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these undistributed earnings is estimated at between million and million 
for further information  see note to the consolidated financial statements  income taxes 
pension and other post retirement benefits the calculation of pension expense  other post retirement benefit expense and pension and other post retirement liabilities require the use of assumptions 
changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and reported liability amounts  and future actual experience can differ from the assumptions 
duke energy believes that the most critical assumptions for pension and other post retirement benefits are the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate 
additionally  medical and prescription drug cost trend rate assumptions are critical to duke energy s estimates of other post retirement benefits 
funding requirements for defined benefit db plans are determined by government regulations 
duke energy made voluntary contributions to its db retirement plans of million in  million in and zero in in  duke energy anticipates making million of contributions to its db plans 
duke energy plans duke energy and its subsidiaries including legacy cinergy businesses maintain non contributory defined benefit retirement plans 
the plans cover most us employees using a cash balance formula 
under a cash balance formula  a plan participant accumulates a retirement benefit consisting of pay credits that are based upon a percentage which may vary with age and years of service of current eligible earnings and current interest credits 
certain legacy cinergy employees are covered under plans that use a final average earnings formula 
under a final average earnings formula  a plan participant accumulates a retirement benefit equal to a percentage of their highest year average earnings  plus a percentage of their highest year average earnings in excess of covered compensation per year of participation maximum of years  plus a percentage of their highest year average earnings times years of participation in excess of years 
duke energy also maintains non qualified  non contributory defined benefit retirement plans which cover certain executives 
duke energy and most of its subsidiaries also provide some health care and life insurance benefits for retired employees on a contributory and non contributory basis 
certain employees are eligible for these benefits if they have met age and service requirements at retirement  as defined in the plans 
duke energy recognized pre tax qualified pension cost of million in in  duke energy s pre tax qualified pension cost is expected to be million lower than in resulting primarily from inclusion of special settlement and contract termination benefit costs in that will not be included in duke energy recognized pre tax nonqualified pension cost of million and pre tax other post part ii retirement benefits cost of million  in in  pre tax non qualified pension cost and pre tax other post retirement benefits costs are expected to be approximately the same amounts in for both pension and other post retirement plans  duke energy assumes that its plan s assets will generate a long term rate of return of as of december  the assets for duke energy s pension and other post retirement plans are maintained in a master trust 
the investment objective of the master trust is to achieve reasonable returns on trust assets  subject to a prudent level of portfolio risk  for the purpose of enhancing the security of benefits for plan participants 
the asset allocation targets were set after considering the investment objective and the risk profile 
us equities are held for their high expected return 
non us equities  debt securities  hedge funds  real estate and other global securities are held for diversification 
investments within asset classes are to be diversified to achieve broad market participation and reduce the impact of individual managers or investments 
duke energy regularly reviews its actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances its investments to its targeted allocation when considered appropriate 
duke energy also invests other post retirement assets in the duke energy corporation employee benefits trust veba i and the duke energy corporation post retirement medical benefits trust veba ii 
the investment objective of the vebas is to achieve sufficient returns  subject to a prudent level of portfolio risk  for the purpose of promoting the security of plan benefits for participants 
the vebas are passively managed 
the expected long term rate of return of for the plan s assets was developed using a weighted average calculation of expected returns based primarily on future expected returns across asset classes considering the use of active asset managers 
the weighted average returns expected by asset classes were for us equities  for non us equities  for global equities  for debt securities  for global private equity  for hedge funds  for real estate and for other global securities 
duke energy discounted its future us pension and other post retirement obligations using a rate of as of december  duke energy determines the appropriate discount based on a yield curve approach 
under the yield curve approach  expected future benefit payments for each plan are discounted by a rate on a third party bond yield curve corresponding to each duration 
the yield curve is based on a bond universe of aa and aaa rated long term corporate bonds 
a single discount rate is calculated that would yield the same present value as the sum of the discounted cash flows 
future changes in plan asset returns  assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in duke energy s pension and post retirement plans will impact duke energy s future pension expense and liabilities 
management cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future 
the following table presents the approximate effect on duke energy s pre tax pension expense  pension obligation and other post retirement benefit obligation if a change in rates were to occur qualified pension plans other post retirement plans in millions effect on pre tax pension expense expected long term rate of return discount rate effect on benefit obligation at december  discount rate duke energy s us post retirement plan uses a medical care trend rate which reflects the near and long term expectation of increases in medical health care costs

part ii liquidity and capital resources known trends and uncertainties at december   duke energy had cash and cash equivalents of billion  of which million is held in foreign jurisdictions and is forecasted to be used to fund the operations of and investments in international energy 
to fund its liquidity and capital requirements during  duke energy will rely primarily upon cash flows from operations  borrowings  and its existing cash and cash equivalents 
the relatively stable operating cash flows of the us franchised electric and gas business segment compose a substantial portion of duke energy s cash flows from operations and it is anticipated that it will continue to do so for the next several years 
a material adverse change in operations  or in available financing  could impact duke energy s ability to fund its current liquidity and capital resource requirements 
ultimate cash flows from operations are subject to a number of factors  including  but not limited to  regulatory constraints  economic trends and market volatility see item a 
risk factors for details 
duke energy projects capital and investment expenditures of billion  primarily consisting of billion at us franchised electric and gas billion at commercial power billion at international energy and billion at other duke energy continues to focus on reducing risk and positioning its business for future success and will invest principally in its strongest business sectors 
based on this goal  of total projected capital expenditures are allocated to the us franchised electric and gas segment 
total us franchised electric and gas projected capital and investment expenditures include billion for system growth  billion for maintenance and upgrades of existing plants and infrastructure to serve load growth and billion of nuclear fuel 
with respect to the capital expenditure plan  duke energy has flexibility within its billion budget to defer or eliminate certain spending should the broad economic recovery stall 
of the billion budget  billion relates to projects for which management has committed capital  including  but not limited to  the continued construction of cliffside unit  the edwardsport igcc plant and the buck and dan river combined cycle gas fired facilities  and management intends to spend those capital dollars in irrespective of broader economic factors 
billion of projected capital expenditures are expected to be used primarily for overall system maintenance  customer connections and corporate expenditures 
although these expenditures are ultimately necessary to ensure overall system maintenance and reliability  the timing of the expenditures may be influenced by broad economic conditions and customer growth  thus management has more flexibility in terms of when these dollars are actually spent 
the remaining planned capital expenditures of billion are of a discretionary nature and relate to growth opportunities in which duke energy may invest  provided there are opportunities that meet return expectations 
as a result of duke energy s significant commitment to modernize its generating fleet through the construction of new units  as well as its focus on increasing its renewable energy portfolio  the ability to cost effectively manage the construction phase of current and future projects is critical to ensuring full and timely recovery of costs of construction within its regulated operations 
should duke energy encounter significant cost overruns above amounts approved by the various state commissions  and those amounts are disallowed for recovery in rates  future cash flows and results of operations could be adversely impacted 
many of duke energy s current capital expenditure projects  including system modernization and renewable investments  qualify for bonus depreciation 
duke energy estimates that over time it could generate cumulative cash benefits between billion and billion from these provisions 
this broad range reflects uncertainty over how bonus depreciation rules will be applied 
duke energy is waiting for clarification from the us department of treasury to determine which projects will qualify for or for bonus depreciation deductions 
even though bonus depreciation related to duke energy s regulated projects reduces rate base  the cash benefits will decrease duke energy s need for financings over time and help to mitigate future customer rate increases 
duke energy anticipates its debt to total capitalization ratio to be in in  duke energy currently anticipates issuing additional net debt of billion  primarily for the purpose of funding capital expenditures 
due to the flexibility in the timing of projected capital expenditures  the timing and amount of debt issuances throughout could be influenced by changes in the timing of capital spending 
duke energy has access to unsecured revolving credit facilities  which are not restricted upon general market conditions  with aggregate bank commitments of billion 
additionally  duke energy has access to billion in credit facilities from smaller regional banks 
at december   duke energy has available borrowing capacity of billion under these facilities 
management currently believes that amounts available under its revolving credit facility are accessible should there be a need to generate additional short term financing in  such as the issuance of commercial paper 
management expects that cash flows from operations and issuances of debt will be sufficient to cover the funding requirements related to capital and investments expenditures and dividend payments 
duke energy monitors compliance with all debt covenants and restrictions and does not currently believe it will be in violation or breach of its significant debt covenants during however  circumstances could arise that may alter that view  including a future change in tax law governing us taxation of foreign earnings 
if and when management had a belief that such potential breach could exist  appropriate action would be taken to mitigate any such issue 
duke energy also maintains an active dialogue with the credit rating agencies 
duke energy periodically evaluates the impact of repatriation of cash generated and held in foreign countries 
duke energy s current intent is to indefinitely reinvest foreign earnings 
however  circumstances could arise that may alter that view 
if duke energy were to decide to repatriate foreign generated and held cash  recognition of material us federal income tax liabilities could be required

under this form s  which is uncapped  duke energy  duke energy carolinas  duke energy ohio and duke energy indiana may issue debt and other securities in the future at amounts  prices and with terms to be determined at the time of future offerings 
the registration statement also allows for the issuance of common stock by duke energy 
duke energy has paid quarterly cash dividends for consecutive years and expects to continue its policy of paying regular cash dividends in the future 
there is no assurance as to the amount of future dividends because they depend on future earnings  capital requirements  financial condition and are subject to the discretion of the board of directors 
dividend and other funding restrictions of duke energy subsidiaries 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements regulatory matters  duke energy s wholly owned public utility operating companies have restrictions on the amount of funds that can be transferred to duke energy via dividend  advance or loan as a result of conditions imposed by various regulators in conjunction with duke energy s merger with cinergy 
additionally  certain other duke energy subsidiaries have other restrictions  such as minimum working capital and tangible net worth requirements pursuant to debt and other agreements that limit the amount of funds that can be transferred to duke energy 
at december   the amount of restricted net assets of wholly owned subsidiaries of duke energy that may not be distributed to duke energy in the form of a loan or dividend is billion 
however  duke energy does not have any legal or other restrictions on paying common stock dividends to shareholders out of its consolidated retained earnings account 
although these restrictions cap the amount of funding the various operating subsidiaries can provide to duke energy  management does not believe these restrictions will have any significant impact on duke energy s ability to access cash to meet its payment of dividends on common stock and other future funding obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements duke energy and certain of its subsidiaries enter into guarantee arrangements in the normal course of business to facilitate commercial transactions with third parties 
these arrangements include performance guarantees  stand by letters of credit  debt guarantees  surety bonds and indemnifications 
most of the guarantee arrangements entered into by duke energy enhance the credit standing of certain subsidiaries  non consolidated entities or less than wholly owned entities  enabling them to conduct business 
as such  these guarantee arrangements involve elements of performance and credit risk  which are not included on the consolidated balance sheets 
the possibility of duke energy  either on its own or on behalf of spectra energy capital  llc spectra capital through indemnification agreements entered into as part of the spin off of spectra energy corp spectra energy  having to honor its contingencies is largely dependent upon the future operations of the subsidiaries  investees and other third parties  or the occurrence of certain future events 
duke energy performs ongoing assessments of its guarantee obligations to determine whether any liabilities have been triggered as a result of potential increased non performance risk by parties for which duke energy has issued guarantees 
except for certain performance obligations related to crescent  which filed chapter bankruptcy petitions in a us bankruptcy court in june and for which a liability of million was recorded during due to the probability of performance under certain guarantees  it is not probable as of december  that duke energy will have to perform under its remaining existing guarantee obligations 
however  management continues to monitor the financial condition of the third parties or non wholly owned entities for whom duke energy has issued guarantees on behalf of to determine whether performance under these guarantees becomes probable in the future 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  guarantees and indemnifications  for further details of the guarantee arrangements 
issuance of these guarantee arrangements is not required for the majority of duke energy s operations 
thus  if duke energy discontinued issuing these guarantees  there would not be a material impact to the consolidated results of operations  cash flows or financial position

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
risk management policies duke energy and its registrants are exposed to market risks associated with commodity prices  credit exposure  interest rates  equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
management has established comprehensive risk management policies to monitor and manage these market risks 
duke energy s chief executive officer and chief financial officer are responsible for the overall approval of market risk management policies and the delegation of approval and authorization levels 
the finance and risk management committee of the board of directors receives periodic updates from the chief risk officer and other members of management on market risk positions  corporate exposures  credit exposures and overall risk management activities 
the chief risk officer is responsible for the overall governance of managing credit risk and commodity price risk  including monitoring exposure limits 
commodity price risk duke energy duke energy and its registrants are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the prices of electricity  coal  natural gas and other energy related products marketed and purchased as a result of its ownership of energy related assets 
duke energy s exposure to these fluctuations is limited by the cost based regulation of its us franchised electric and gas operations and certain portions of commercial power s operations as these regulated operations are typically allowed to recover certain of these costs through various cost recovery clauses  including fuel clauses 
while there may be a delay in timing between when these costs are incurred and when these costs are recovered through rates  changes from year to year have no material impact on operating results of these regulated operations 
additionally  most of duke energy s long term power sales contracts substantially shift all fuel price risk to the purchaser 
price risk represents the potential risk of loss from adverse changes in the market price of electricity or other energy commodities 
duke energy s exposure to commodity price risk is influenced by a number of factors  including contract size  length  market liquidity  location and unique or specific contract terms 
duke energy employs established policies and procedures to manage its risks associated with these market fluctuations  which may include using various commodity derivatives  such as swaps  futures  forwards and options 
for additional information  see note to the consolidated financial statements  risk management  derivative instruments and hedging activities 
validation of a contract s fair value is performed by an internal group separate from duke energy s deal origination areas 
while duke energy uses common industry practices to develop its valuation techniques  changes in duke energy s pricing methodologies or the underlying assumptions could result in significantly different fair values and income recognition 
hedging strategies 
duke energy closely monitors the risks associated with commodity price changes on its future operations and  where appropriate  uses various commodity instruments such as electricity  coal and natural gas forward contracts to mitigate the effect of such fluctuations on operations 
duke energy s primary use of energy commodity derivatives is to hedge the generation portfolio against exposure to the prices of power and fuel 
the majority of derivatives used to manage duke energy s commodity price exposure are either not designated as a hedge or do not qualify for hedge accounting 
these instruments are referred to as undesignated contracts 
undesignated derivatives entered into by part ii regulated businesses reflect mark to market changes of the derivative instruments fair value as a regulatory asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheets 
undesignated derivatives entered into by unregulated businesses are marked to market each period  with changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments reflected in earnings 
certain derivatives used to manage duke energy s commodity price exposure are accounted for as either cash flow hedges or fair value hedges 
to the extent that instruments accounted for as hedges are effective in offsetting the transaction being hedged  there is no impact to the consolidated statements of operations until after delivery or settlement occurs 
accordingly  assumptions and valuation techniques for these contracts have no impact on reported earnings prior to settlement 
several factors influence the effectiveness of a hedge contract  including the use of contracts with different commodities or unmatched terms and counterparty credit risk 
hedge effectiveness is monitored regularly and measured at least quarterly 
in addition to the hedge contracts described above and recorded on the consolidated balance sheets  duke energy enters into other contracts that qualify for the npns exception 
when a contract meets the criteria to qualify as a npns  us franchised electric and gas and commercial power apply such exception 
income recognition and realization related to normal purchases and normal sales contracts generally coincide with the physical delivery of power 
for contracts qualifying for the npns exception  no recognition of the contract s fair value in the consolidated financial statements is required until settlement of the contract as long as the transaction remains probable of occurring

credit risk duke energy credit risk represents the loss that duke energy registrants would incur if a counterparty fails to perform under its contractual obligations 
to reduce credit exposure  duke energy seeks to enter into netting agreements with counterparties that permit duke energy to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties 
duke energy attempts to further reduce credit risk with certain counterparties by part ii entering into agreements that enable duke energy to obtain collateral or to terminate or reset the terms of transactions after specified time periods or upon the occurrence of credit related events 
duke energy may  at times  use credit derivatives or other structures and techniques to provide for third party credit enhancement of duke energy s counterparties obligations 
duke energy also obtains cash or letters of credit from customers to provide credit support outside of collateral agreements  where appropriate  based on its financial analysis of the customer and the regulatory or contractual terms and conditions applicable to each transaction 
duke energy s industry has historically operated under negotiated credit lines for physical delivery contracts 
duke energy frequently uses master collateral agreements to mitigate certain credit exposures 
the collateral agreements provide for a counterparty to post cash or letters of credit to the exposed party for exposure in excess of an established threshold 
the threshold amount represents an unsecured credit limit  determined in accordance with the corporate credit policy 
collateral agreements also provide that the inability to post collateral is sufficient cause to terminate contracts and liquidate all positions

interest rate risk the duke energy registrants are exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates as a result of their issuance of variable and fixed rate debt and commercial paper 
the duke energy registrants manage interest rate exposure by limiting variable rate exposures to a percentage of total capitalization and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates 
the duke energy registrants also enter into financial derivative instruments  which may include instruments such as  but not limited to  interest rate swaps  swaptions and us treasury lock agreements to manage and mitigate interest rate risk exposure

duke energy based on a sensitivity analysis as of december   it was estimated that if market interest rates average higher lower in than in  interest expense  net of offsetting impacts in interest income  would increase decrease by million 
comparatively  based on a sensitivity analysis as of december   had interest rates averaged higher lower in than in  it was estimated that interest expense  net of offsetting impacts in interest income  would have increased decreased by million 
these amounts were estimated by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on variable rate securities outstanding  adjusted for interest rate hedges  short term and long term investments  cash and cash equivalents outstanding as of december  and the decrease in interest rate sensitivity is primarily due to repayment of the master credit facility borrowings  swapping project financed debt from floating to fixed and increased cash balances

marketable securities price risk duke energy as described further in note to the consolidated financial statements  investments in debt and equity securities  duke energy invests in debt and equity securities as part of various investment portfolios to fund certain obligations of the business 
the vast majority of the investments in equity securities are within the ndtf and assets of the various pension and other post retirement benefit plans 
pension plan assets 
duke energy maintains investments to help fund the costs of providing non contributory defined benefit retirement and other post retirement benefit plans 
those investments are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets and changes in interest rates 
duke energy has established asset allocation targets for its pension plan holdings  which take into consideration the investment objectives and the risk profile with respect to the trust in which the assets are held 
duke energy s target asset allocation for equity securities is of the value of the plan assets and the holdings are diversified to achieve broad market participation and reduce the impact of any single investment  sector or geographic region 
a significant decline in the value of plan asset holdings could require duke energy to increase its funding of the pension plan in future periods  which could adversely affect cash flows in those periods 
additionally  a decline in the fair value of plan assets  absent additional cash contributions to the plan  could increase the amount of pension cost required to be recorded in future periods  which could adversely affect duke energy s results of operations in those periods

duke energy carolinas ndtf 
as required by the nrc and the ncuc  duke energy carolinas maintains trust funds to fund the costs of nuclear decommissioning see note to the consolidated financial statements  asset retirement obligations 
as of december   these funds were invested primarily in domestic and international equity securities  debt securities  fixed income securities  cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
per the nrc and the ncuc requirements  these funds may be used only for activities related to nuclear decommissioning 
the investments in equity securities are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets 
accounting for nuclear decommissioning recognizes that costs are recovered through duke energy carolinas rates  therefore  fluctuations in equity prices do not affect duke energy carolinas consolidated statements of operations as changes in the fair value of these investments are deferred as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities pursuant to an order by the ncuc 
earnings or losses of the fund will ultimately impact the amount of costs recovered through duke energy carolinas rates 
in and again in and  the ncuc and pscsc approved a million annual amount for contributions and expense levels for decommissioning 
in each of the years ended december   and  duke energy expensed million and contributed cash of million to the ndtf for decommissioning costs 
the balance of the ndtf was  million and  million as of december  and  respectively 
as the ncuc and the pscsc require that duke energy update its cost estimate for decommissioning its nuclear plants every five years  new site specific nuclear decommissioning cost studies were completed in january that showed total estimated nuclear decommissioning costs  including the cost to decommission plant components not subject to radioactive contamination  of billion in dollars 
this estimate includes duke energy carolina s ownership interest in the catawba nuclear station 
the other joint owners of catawba nuclear station are responsible for decommissioning costs related to their ownership interests in the station 
duke energy filed these site specific nuclear decommissioning cost studies with the ncuc and the pscsc in april in addition to the decommissioning cost studies  a new funding study was completed and indicates the current annual funding requirement of million is sufficient to cover the estimated decommissioning costs 
both the ncuc and the pscsc approved the existing million annual funding level for nuclear decommissioning costs 
both the ncuc and the pscsc have allowed duke energy to recover estimated decommissioning costs through retail rates over the expected remaining service periods of duke energy s nuclear stations 
duke energy believes that the decommissioning costs being recovered through rates  when coupled with expected fund earnings  will be sufficient to provide for the cost of future decommissioning

foreign currency risk duke energy is exposed to foreign currency risk from investments in international affiliate businesses owned and operated in foreign countries and from certain commodity related transactions within domestic operations that are denominated in foreign currencies 
to mitigate risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations  contracts may be denominated in or indexed to the us dollar inflation rates and or local inflation rates  or investments may be naturally hedged through debt denominated or issued in the foreign currency 
duke energy may also use foreign currency derivatives  where possible  to manage its risk related to foreign currency fluctuations 
to monitor its currency exchange rate risks  duke energy uses sensitivity analysis  which measures the impact of devaluation of the foreign currencies to which it has exposure 
in  duke energy s primary foreign currency rate exposure is to the brazilian real 
a devaluation in the currency exchange rates as of december  in all of duke energy s exposure currencies would result in an estimated net pre tax loss on the translation of local currency earnings of million to duke energy s consolidated statements of operations in the consolidated balance sheet would be negatively impacted by million currency translation through the cumulative translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci as of december  as a result of a devaluation in the currency exchange rates 
for comparative purposes  as of december   a devaluation in the currency exchange rates in all of duke energy s exposure currencies was expected to result in an estimated net pre tax loss on the translation of local currency earnings of million to duke energy s consolidated statements of operations and a reduction of million currency translation through the cumulative translation adjustment in aoci as of december  other issues general 
duke energy s fixed charges coverage ratio  as calculated using sec guidelines  was times for both and  and times for duke energy carolinas fixed charges coverage ratio  as calculated using sec guidelines  was times for  and times for both and for duke energy ohio  for the years ended december  and december   earnings were insufficient to cover fixed charges by million and million  respectively  due primarily to non cash goodwill impairment charges of million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   duke energy ohio s fixed charges coverage ratio was times 
duke energy indiana s fixed charges coverage ratio  as calculated using sec guidelines was times for  times for and times for global climate change and other epa regulations under development 
although there is still much to learn about the causes and long term effects of climate change  many  including the duke energy registrants  advocate taking steps now to begin reducing greenhouse gas ghg emissions with the long term aim of stabilizing the atmospheric concentration of ghgs 
the us environmental protection agency epa publishes an inventory of man made us ghg emissions annually 
carbon dioxide us  a byproduct of all sources of combustion including fossil fuel combustion and motor vehicle operations  currently accounts for about of total us ghg emissions 
the duke energy registrants ghg emissions consist primarily of co and most come from its fleet of coal fired power plants in the us in  the duke energy registrants us power plants emitted approximately million tons of co the co emissions from duke energy s international electric operations are less than million tons annually 
the duke energy registrants future co emissions will be influenced by variables including new regulations  economic conditions that affect electricity demand  and the duke energy registrants decisions regarding generation technologies deployed to meet customer electricity needs 
on june   the us house of representatives passed us the american clean energy and security act of aces 
this legislation included a ghg cap and trade program covering approximately of the ghg emissions in the us economy  including emissions from the electric utility sector 
on november   the us senate environment and public works committee passed and sent to the senate floor s 
the clean energy jobs and american power act of the senate s legislation included an economy wide cap and trade program similar to the one contained in aces 
however  the th congress adjourned on january   without passage of h 
r or any other legislation mandating the control or reduction of ghg emissions 
this means that any potential effort by the th congress to pass legislation mandating ghg emission reductions would have to start anew because legislation that is not passed in a previous congress does not carry over to the next 
the duke energy registrants believe that it is highly unlikely that legislation mandating reductions in ghg emissions will be passed by the th congress which ends at the end of beyond the prospects for enactment of any legislation mandating reductions in ghg emissions is highly uncertain 
while the duke energy registrants continue to believe that congress will eventually adopt some form of mandatory ghg emission reduction legislation  management cannot predict if or when such legislation might be enacted  what the requirements of any potential legislation might be  or the potential impact it might have on the duke energy registrants 
on december   the epa finalized an endangerment finding for greenhouse gases under the clean air act caa 
the endangerment finding did not impose any regulatory requirements on the electric utility industry  but it was a necessary prerequisite for the epa to be able to finalize several subsequent ghg rules 
a subsequent epa regulation of ghgs from mobile sources issued in resulted in ghgs being pollutants subject to regulation under the caa  thereby subjecting newly constructed and modified stationary sources to caa s prevention of significant deterioration psd permitting program for increases in ghgs 
without any changes  the caa requirements would have subjected tens of thousands of additional stationary sources to psd permitting requirements 
to avoid this result  the epa issued the tailoring rule on june  under the tailoring rule  which went into effect on january   new major stationary sources of ghgs and existing major stationary sources of ghgs that undertake a modification that will result in a net ghg emissions increase of at least  tons per year are subject to ghg permitting requirements under the psd permitting program 
all of the duke energy registrants existing coal fired generating units and several of its natural gas fired generating units are major sources of ghg emissions 
the psd permitting program requires sources that trigger psd permitting requirements for ghgs to perform a best available control technology bact analysis for ghg emissions to determine what  if any  actions must be taken at the source to limit its ghg emissions 
in each of the states in which the duke energy registrants operates major stationary sources of ghg emissions  the state is the permitting authority for the psd program 
this means that the states will ultimately determine the bact requirements that will apply in the event the duke energy registrants trigger psd permitting requirements for ghg emissions at any of its facilities 
greenhouse gas psd permitting requirements and the application of bact to limit ghg emissions do not apply to any existing source that does not undertake a modification resulting in a net ghg emissions increase of at least  tons per year 
while the duke energy part ii registrants do not anticipate taking actions that would trigger the psd permitting requirements for ghgs at any of its existing generating facilities or facilities currently under construction  if it were to do so  management does not believe that it would have a material impact on the duke energy registrants future results of operations 
numerous entities have filed petitions with the dc circuit court of appeals for review of epa s endangerment finding and tailoring rule 
management cannot predict the outcome of the litigation and it could be several years before the legal challenges are ultimately resolved 
in december  the epa announced that it had entered into a settlement agreement requiring it to propose by july  and finalize by may  a rule to establish ghg emission standards new source performance standards for new fossil fueled electric generating units and existing fossil fueled electric generating units that undertake a major modification 
the epa also announced that it will issue emission guidelines for states for their use in developing plans for reducing ghg emissions at existing fossil fueled electric generating units that do not undertake a major modification 
the outcome of these pending epa regulatory actions is uncertain and management cannot determine at this time if they will have a material impact on the duke energy registrants future results of operations or cash flows 
the duke energy registrants do not anticipate any of the states in which it currently operates fossil fueled electric generating units to take action to mandate reductions in ghg emissions from these facilities 
the duke energy registrants are taking actions today that will result in reduced ghg emissions over time 
these actions will lower the duke energy registrants exposure to any future mandatory ghg emission reduction requirements  whether a result of federal legislation or epa regulation 
under any future scenario involving mandatory ghg limitations  the duke energy registrants would plan to seek recovery of their compliance costs through appropriate regulatory mechanisms in the jurisdictions in which it operates 
the duke energy registrants recognize that certain groups associate severe weather events with climate change  and forecast the possibility that these weather events could have a material impact on future results of operations should they occur more frequently and with greater severity 
however  the uncertain nature of potential changes of extreme weather events such as increased frequency  duration  and severity  the long period of time over which any potential changes might take place  and the inability to predict these with any degree of accuracy  make estimating any potential future financial risk to the duke energy registrants operations that may result from the physical risks of potential changes in the frequency and or severity of extreme weather events  whatever the cause or causes might be  impossible 
currently  the duke energy registrants plan and prepare for extreme weather events that it experiences from time to time  such as ice storms  tornados  hurricanes  severe thunderstorms  high winds and droughts 
the duke energy registrants past experiences preparing for and responding to the impacts of these types of weather related events would reasonably be expected to help management plan and prepare for future severe weather events to reduce  but not eliminate  the operational  economic and financial impacts of such events 
for example  the duke energy registrants routinely take steps to reduce the potential impact of severe weather events on its electric distribution systems 
the duke energy registrants electric generating facilities are designed to withstand extreme weather events without damage 
the duke energy registrants maintain an inventory of coal and oil on site to mitigate the effects of any potential short term disruption in its fuel supply so it can continue to provide its customers with an uninterrupted supply of electricity 
the duke energy registrants have a program in place to effectively manage the impact of future droughts on its operations 
the duke energy registrants do not currently operate in coastal areas and therefore are not exposed to the effects of potential sea level rise 
in addition to regulations for ghgs  the epa is developing several other environmental regulations that  as a group  will affect the electric utility industry 
included in that group are the previously proposed transport rule  regulations for coal combustion residuals and pending proposals for clean water act b and utility boiler maximum achievable control technology mact emission standards 
as a group  non ghg environmental regulations under development will require the duke energy registrants to install additional environmental controls and may result in the accelerated retirement of some older coal fired units 
while the final requirements for the duke energy registrants from the epa s regulatory actions will not be known until the second half of and later  for planning purposes  the duke energy registrants currently estimate the costs of new control equipment that may need to be installed could total approximately billion over the next years 
the duke energy registrants expect to also incur incremental increases in operation  maintenance  and other expenses in conjunction with the non ghg proposed and pending epa regulations 
additionally  the duke energy registrants are evaluating the need to retire approximately  mw of coal fired generating capacity if it is not economical to bring these plants into compliance with the epa regulations and for other reasons 
until the final regulatory requirements are known and can be fully evaluated  the potential compliance costs associated with these epa regulatory actions are subject to considerable uncertainty 
therefore  the actual compliance costs incurred or mw to be retired may be materially different from these estimates based on the timing and requirements of the final epa regulations

part ii new accounting standards the following new accounting standards updates asu have been issued  but have not yet been adopted by duke energy  as of december  asc revenue recognition asc 
in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new revenue recognition accounting guidance in response to practice concerns related to the accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
this new accounting guidance primarily applies to all contractual arrangements in which a vendor will perform multiple revenue generating activities and addresses the unit of accounting for arrangements involving multiple deliverables  as well as how arrangement consideration should be allocated to the separate units of accounting 
for the duke energy registrants  the new accounting guidance is effective january  and will be applied prospectively 
the duke energy registrants do not expect this new accounting guidance to have a material impact to its consolidated results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
asc intangibles goodwill and other asc 
in december  the fasb amended the accounting guidance related to annual goodwill impairment tests 
this revised accounting guidance requires entities which have reporting units with a zero or negative carrying value to assess  considering qualitative factors such as those described in existing accounting guidance  whether is it more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
if an entity concludes that it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists for the applicable reporting unit  the entity must perform step of the goodwill impairment test 
for duke energy  the revised accounting guidance is effective january  and will be applied prospectively 
duke energy is currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of this revised accounting guidance on its annual impairment test of goodwill and is unable to estimate at this time the impact of adoption on its consolidated results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
none of duke energy s reporting units had a negative carrying value as of december  asc business combinations asc 
in november  the fasb issued new accounting guidance in response to diversity in the interpretation of pro forma information requirements for business combinations 
the new accounting guidance requires an entity to present pro forma financial information as if a business combination occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented as well as additional disclosures describing the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments 
for duke energy  this new accounting guidance is effective january  and will be applied to all business combinations consummated after that date 
asc fair value measurements and disclosures asc
