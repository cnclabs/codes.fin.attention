we have design  process and utility patents as well as pending patent applications in the united states and other nations 
we file applications for united states and foreign patents for inventions  designs and improvements that we believe have commercial value  however  these patents may or may not ultimately be issued 
we believe our success primarily depends on our ability to continue offering innovative solutions to consumer needs through design  research  
table of contents development and production advancements rather than our ability to secure patents 
the technologies  processes and designs described in issued patents are incorporated into many of our most important products and expire at various times

additionally  we license our columbia trademarks across a range of apparel  footwear  accessories and equipment 
sales and distribution we sell our products through a mix of wholesale distribution channels  independent distributors  our own direct to consumer channels and licensees 
the majority of our sales are generated through wholesale channels which include small  independently operated specialty outdoor and sporting goods stores  regional  national and international sporting goods chains  and large regional  national and international department store chains 
we sell our products to independent distributors in various countries where we generally do not have direct sales operations 
we sell our products directly to consumers through our own network of branded and outlet retail stores in each of our geographic segments  and online operations in the united states and laap segments  with additional e commerce sites in other geographic markets planned for our direct to consumer operations are designed to elevate consumer perception of our brands  increase consumer and retailer awareness of and demand for our products  model compelling retail environments for our products and build stronger emotional brand connections with consumers over time 
our branded retail stores allow us to showcase a broad selection of products and to support the brand s positioning with fixtures and imagery that may then be replicated and offered for use by our wholesale customers 
these stores provide high visibility for our brands and products and help us to monitor the needs and preferences of consumers 
in addition  we operate outlet stores  which serve an important role in our overall inventory management by allowing us to sell a significant portion of excess  discontinued and out of season products while maintaining the integrity of our brands 
e commerce sales are a small but growing portion of our total direct to consumer sales 
we operate in four geographic segments united states  latin america and asia pacific laap  europe  middle east and africa emea  and canada  which are reflective of our internal organization  management  and oversight structure

in some instances  we arrange to have products shipped directly from the independent factories that manufacture our products to customer designated facilities in canada 
marketing we believe our brand names and trademarks provide a competitive advantage and help to differentiate our products in the marketplace 
marketing programs are an integral part of our global strategy to build brand equity  raise global brand relevance and awareness  infuse our brands with excitement and stimulate consumer demand for our products worldwide 
during  the cost of our marketing programs represented approximately of net sales 

table of contents our integrated marketing efforts are designed to deliver consistent messages about the performance benefits  innovative technologies and styling of our products 
we rely most heavily on advertising distributed through the internet  including e commerce and social media sites  television and print publications  consumer focused and customer focused events  branded retail stores in selected high profile locations  enhanced branded displays and merchandising techniques executed in stores in partnership with various wholesale customers  and consumer and trade public relations efforts 
we work closely with our key wholesale customers to reinforce our brand message through cooperative online  television  radio and print advertising campaigns  as well as in stores using visual merchandising display tools dedicated exclusively to selling our merchandise on a year round basis 
we drive alignment through established seasonal initiatives and provide our wholesale customers  regional offices  and international distributors with creative direction and materials to convey consistent messages 
we employ a staff of in store marketing and merchandising coordinators  who visit our customers retail locations in major cities around the world to ensure that our products are favorably presented 
we also reinforce our marketing and product innovation messages through selected sponsorships of key outdoor influencers  organizations and teams who serve as inspirational models of excellence to consumers and also through sponsorship of selected outdoor events and competitions 
our global internet marketing sites are used by consumers to research our products features and benefits  to interact with content created to inform and entertain about each brand and its technologies  to be directed to nearby retailers where they can purchase our products  and to directly purchase products for delivery in the united states 
other unaffiliated consumer websites provide information about our brands and products and may direct consumers to our wholesale customers where they can purchase our products 
working capital utilization we design  develop  market and distribute our products  but do not own or operate manufacturing facilities 
as a result  most of our capital is invested in short term working capital assets  including cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  accounts receivable from customers  and finished goods inventory 
at december   working capital assets accounted for approximately of total assets 
as a result  the degree to which we efficiently utilize our working capital assets can have a significant impact on our profitability  cash flows and return on invested capital 
the overall goals of our working capital management efforts are to maintain the minimum level of inventory necessary to deliver goods on time to our customers to satisfy end consumer demand  and to minimize the cycle time from the purchase of inventory from our suppliers to the collection of accounts receivable balances from our customers 
demand planning and inventory management as a branded consumer products company  inventory represents one of the largest and riskiest capital commitments in our business model 
we design and develop our seasonal product lines to months in advance of their availability to consumers in retail stores 
as a result  our ability to forecast and produce the individual product styles that match ultimate seasonal wholesale customer and end consumer demand and to deliver products to our customers in a timely and cost effective manner can significantly affect our sales  gross margins and profitability 
for this reason  we maintain and continue to make substantial investments in information systems  processes and personnel that support our ongoing demand planning efforts 
the goals of our demand planning efforts are to develop a collaborative forecast that drives the timely purchase of an adequate amount of inventory to satisfy demand  to minimize transportation and expediting costs necessary to deliver products to customers by their requested delivery dates  and to minimize excess inventory to avoid liquidating excess  end of season goods at discounted prices 
failure to achieve our demand planning goals could reduce our revenues and or increase our costs  which would negatively impact our gross margins  profitability and brand strength 

table of contents in order to manage inventory risk  we use incentive discounts to encourage our wholesale customers and distributors to place advance orders at least six months in advance of scheduled delivery 
we use those advance orders  together with forecasted demand from our direct to consumer operations  market trends  historical data  customer and sales feedback and other important factors to estimate the volumes of each product to purchase from our suppliers around the world 
from the time of initial order through production  receipt and delivery  we attempt to manage our inventory to reduce risk 
our inventory management efforts cannot entirely eliminate inventory risk due to the inherently unpredictable nature of consumer demand  the ability of customers to cancel their orders prior to shipment  and other variables that affect our customers ability to take delivery of their advance orders when originally scheduled 
to minimize our purchasing costs  the time necessary to fill customer orders and the risk of non delivery  we place a significant amount of orders for our products with independent factories prior to receiving all of our customers orders and we maintain an inventory of select products that we anticipate will be in greater demand 
in addition  we build calculated amounts of inventory to support estimated at once orders from customers and auto replenishment orders on certain long lived styles 
credit and collection we extend credit to our customers based on an assessment of each customer s financial condition  generally without requiring collateral 
to assist us in scheduling production with our suppliers and delivering seasonal products to our customers on time  we offer customers discounts for placing advance orders and extended payment terms for taking delivery before peak seasonal shipping periods 
these extended payment terms increase our exposure to the risk of uncollectible receivables 
in order to manage the inherent risks of customer receivables  we maintain and continue to invest in information systems  processes and personnel skilled in credit and collections 
in some markets and with some customers we use credit insurance or standby letters of credit to minimize our risk of credit loss 
sourcing and manufacturing we do not own or operate manufacturing facilities and virtually all of our products are manufactured to our specifications by independent factories located outside the united states 
we generally do not maintain long term manufacturing commitments 
we believe that the use of independent factories enables us to substantially limit our capital expenditures and avoid the costs and risks associated with owning and operating large production facilities and managing large labor forces 
we also believe that the use of independent factories greatly increases our production capacity  maximizes our flexibility and improves our product pricing 
we manage our supply chain from a global perspective and adjust as needed to changes in the global production environment  including political risks  factory capacity  import limitations and costs  raw material costs  availability and cost of labor and transportation costs 
however  without long term or reserved commitments  there is no assurance that we will be able to secure adequate or timely production capacity or favorable pricing terms 
our apparel is manufactured in more than countries with vietnam and china accounting for approximately of our apparel production 
our footwear is manufactured in three countries  with china and vietnam accounting for approximately of our footwear production 
our five largest apparel factory groups accounted for approximately of global apparel production  with the largest factory group accounting for of global apparel production 
our five largest footwear factory groups accounted for approximately of global footwear production  with the largest factory group accounting for of global footwear production 
in addition  a single vendor supplies substantially all of the zippers used in our products 
these apparel  footwear and zipper suppliers have multiple factory locations  thus reducing the risk that unfavorable conditions at a single factory or location will have a material adverse effect on our business 

table of contents we maintain manufacturing liaison offices in a total of seven asian countries 
we also maintain a manufacturing liaison office in richmond  california 
personnel in these manufacturing liaison offices are direct employees of columbia  and are responsible for overseeing production at our independent factories 
we believe that having employees physically located in these regions enhances our ability to monitor factories for compliance with our policies  procedures and standards related to quality  delivery  pricing and labor practices 
our quality assurance process is designed to ensure that our products meet our quality standards 
we believe that our quality assurance process is an important and effective means of maintaining the quality and reputation of our products 
in addition  independent contractors that manufacture products for us are subject to our standards of manufacturing practices smp 
columbia manufactures products around the world and values legal  ethical and fair treatment of people involved in manufacturing our products 
each factory producing products for us is monitored regularly against these standards

backlog we typically receive the majority of our advance orders from our wholesale customers and independent distributors for the fall and spring seasons by march and september  respectively  based upon customer ordering deadlines that we establish 
as a result  our order backlog at each of march and september has historically been a meaningful indicator of anticipated sales to wholesale customers and independent distributors for the corresponding future period 
accordingly  we disclose our backlog at march and at september in our quarterly reports on form q for those respective periods  rather than at december generally  orders are subject to cancellation prior to the date of shipment 
advance orders for our owned retail stores and e commerce websites are not included in backlog 
accordingly  to the extent that order cancellations from wholesale customers and independent distributors deviates from historical averages  and our retail and e commerce sales grow to represent a larger proportion of our total sales  our advance order backlog may become less indicative of anticipated sales for corresponding future periods 
competition the markets for outerwear  sportswear  footwear  accessories and equipment are highly competitive 
in each of our geographic markets  we face significant competition from numerous and varying competitors 
some of our large wholesale customers also market competitive apparel  footwear  accessories and equipment under their own private labels 
our licensees operate in very competitive markets  such as those for apparel  footwear  sunglasses and watches 
in addition  our direct to consumer channels expose us to competitors who operate retail stores in outlet malls and key metropolitan markets  as well as competitors who sell product online 
we believe that the primary competitive factors in the market for active outerwear  sportswear  footwear  accessories and equipment are brand strength  product innovation  product design  functionality  durability and price 
government regulation many of our international shipments are subject to existing or potential governmental tariff and non tariff barriers to trade  such as import duties and potential safeguard measures that may limit the quantity of various types of goods that may be imported into the united states and other countries 
these trade barriers often represent a material portion of the cost of the merchandise 
our products are also subject to domestic and foreign product safety and environmental standards  laws and other regulations  which are increasingly restrictive and complex 
although we diligently monitor these standards and restrictions  the united states or other countries may impose new or adjusted quotas  duties  safety requirements  material restrictions  or other restrictions or regulations  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows

risk factors in addition to the other information contained in this form k  the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business 
our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows may be materially adversely affected by any of these risks 
please note that additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business and operations 
our success depends on our business strategies our business strategies are to achieve sustainable  profitable growth by creating innovative products  elevating consumer perception of our brands  increasing consumer and retailer awareness and demand for our products  creating compelling retail environments  and building stronger emotional brand connections with consumers over time 
we intend to pursue these strategies across our portfolio of brands  product categories and geographic markets 
we face many challenges in implementing our business strategies 
for example  our focus on innovation depends on our ongoing ability to identify  develop or secure rights to product improvements or developments through internal research  joint developments  acquisitions or licenses 
however  these innovations and developments may not be profitable or have the desired effect of increasing demand for our products 
the failure to implement our business strategies successfully could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
to implement our business strategies  we must continue to modify various aspects of our business  to maintain and enhance our information systems and operations to respond to increased demand and to attract  retain and manage qualified personnel 
changes in our business may place an increasing strain on management  financial  product design  marketing  distribution and other resources  and we may have operating difficulties as a result 
for example  in support of our strategic initiatives  we are making significant investments in our business processes and information technology infrastructure that require significant management attention and corporate resources 
in addition  we may need to adapt our information technology systems and business processes to 
table of contents integrate business acquisitions 
these business initiatives involve many risks and uncertainties that  if not managed effectively  may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
our business strategies and related increased expenditures could also cause our operating margin to decline if we are unable to offset our increased spending with increased sales or gross margins  or comparable reductions in other operating costs 
if our sales or gross margins decline or fail to grow as planned and we fail to sufficiently leverage our operating expenses  our profitability will decline 
this could result in a decision to delay  reduce  modify or terminate our strategic business initiatives  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we depend on independent factories our products are produced by independent factories worldwide 
we do not own or operate any production facilities 
although we enter into purchase order commitments with these independent factories each season  we generally do not maintain long term manufacturing commitments with them 
without long term or reserve commitments  in a capacity constrained environment  there is no assurance that we will be able to secure adequate or timely production capacity or favorable pricing if growth or product demand differs from our forecasts 
independent factories may fail to perform as expected or our competitors may obtain production capacities that effectively limit or eliminate the availability of these resources to us 
if an independent manufacturer fails to ship orders in a timely manner or to meet our standards or if we are unable to obtain necessary capacities  we may miss delivery deadlines or incur additional costs  which may result in cancellation of orders  refusal to accept deliveries  a reduction in purchase prices or increased costs  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
reliance on independent factories also creates quality control risks 
in a capacity constrained environment  we may need to use sub contracted manufacturers to fulfill demand and these manufacturers may have less experience producing our products or lower overall capabilities  which could result in compromised quality of our products 
a failure in our quality control program may result in diminished product quality  which in turn could result in increased order cancellations and returns  decreased consumer demand for our products  or product recalls or other regulatory actions  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
if an independent manufacturer violates labor or other laws  or engages in practices that are not generally accepted as ethical in our key markets  we may be subject to production disruptions or significant negative publicity that could result in long term damage to our brand images  consumer demand for our products may decrease  and in some circumstances parties may attempt to assert that we are liable for the independent manufacturer s practices  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we may be adversely affected by volatility in global production and transportation costs and capacity our product costs are subject to substantial fluctuation based on availability and quality of raw materials  the prices of oil  cotton and other raw materials whose prices are determined by global commodity markets and can be very volatile  changes in labor markets and wage rates paid by our independent factory partners  which are often mandated by centralized governments in the countries where our products are manufactured  particularly in china and vietnam  interest rates and currency exchange rates  
table of contents availability of skilled labor and production capacity at independent factories  and general economic conditions 
following a long period of generally stable to declining input costs  the apparel and footwear industry appears to be entering what may become a prolonged period of inflationary pressure on some or all of these input costs  resulting in increased costs to produce our products 
in addition  since the majority of our products are manufactured outside of our principal sales markets  our products must be transported by third parties over large geographical distances 
shortages in ocean freight capacity  airfreight capacity and volatile fuel costs can result in rapidly changing transportation costs 
for example  during  shortages of sourcing and transportation capacity  combined with later than optimal production of advance orders  caused us to rely more heavily on airfreight to achieve timely delivery to our customers  resulting in significantly higher freight costs 
because we price our products in advance and the external cost changes may be difficult to predict  we may not be able to pass all or a portion of such higher costs on to our customers or adjust our pricing structure in a timely manner in order to remain competitive  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
our sales and profitability may be adversely affected by increased product costs and reduced selling prices the apparel industry is subject to significant pressures on pricing and input costs caused by many factors  including intense competition  constrained sourcing capacity and related inflationary pressures  consolidation in the retail industry  pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products and changes in consumer demand 
these factors may cause us to experience increased costs  reduce our sales prices to retailers and consumers or experience reduced sales in response to increased prices  any of which could cause our operating margin to decline if we are unable to offset these factors with reductions in operating costs and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
attracting superior retail channel partners and improving the sales productivity of our customers each depend on various factors  including the strength of our brand names  our ability to design and source innovative products  competitive conditions  the availability of desirable locations and the negotiation of terms with customers 
future terms with customers may be less favorable to us than those under which we now operate 
large wholesale customers in particular increasingly seek to transfer various costs of business to their vendors  such as the cost of lost profits from promotional activity and product price markdowns  which could cause our gross margins to decline if we are unable to offset price reductions with comparable reductions in operating costs 
we may be adversely affected by volatile economic conditions we are a consumer products company and are highly dependent on consumer discretionary spending patterns and the purchasing patterns of our wholesale customers as they attempt to match their seasonal purchase volumes to volatile consumer demand 
in addition  as we have expanded our base of retail stores  we have increased our direct exposure to the risks associated with volatile and unpredictable consumer discretionary spending patterns 
as global economic conditions continue to be volatile or economic uncertainty remains  trends in consumer discretionary spending also become unpredictable and subject to reductions due to uncertainties about the future and credit constraints 
consumer demand for our products may not reach our sales targets  or may decline  when there is an economic downturn or economic uncertainty in our key markets  particularly markets in north america and our emea region 
our sensitivity to economic cycles and any related fluctuation in consumer demand may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents we rely on our highly customized information management systems our business is increasingly reliant on information technology 
information systems are used across our supply chain and retail operations  from design to distribution and sales  and are used as a method of communication among employees  with our subsidiaries and liaison offices overseas and with our customers and retail stores 
we also rely on our information systems to allocate resources  manage product data  develop demand and supply plans and forecast operating results 
system failures  breaches of confidential information or service interruptions may occur as the result of a number of factors  including computer viruses  programming errors  hacking or other unlawful activities by third parties and disasters  or our failure to properly maintain systems redundancy or to protect  repair  maintain or upgrade our systems 
any breach or interruption of critical business information systems could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
our primary enterprise resource planning system is highly customized to our business 
as a result  the availability of internal and external resources with the expertise to maintain our enterprise resource planning system is limited 
as we implement our direct to consumer initiatives and plan for future growth  our customized enterprise resource planning system may inhibit our ability to operate efficiently  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
for example  our enterprise resource planning system may not be compatible with other systems to support desired functionality for our operations 
initiatives to upgrade our information technology infrastructure involve many risks which could result in  among other things  business interruptions and higher costs we regularly implement business process improvement initiatives to optimize our performance 
our current business process initiatives include  but are not limited to  plans to improve business results through standardization of business processes and technology that support our supply chain and go to market strategies through implementation of an integrated enterprise resource planning software solution by sap over the next few years 
we may experience difficulties when we transition to new or upgraded systems and processes  including loss of data and decreases in productivity as our personnel become familiar with new systems 
in addition  transitioning to new or upgraded systems will require significant capital investments and personnel resources 
difficulties in implementing new or upgraded information systems or significant system failures could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we expect implementation of this new information technology infrastructure to have a pervasive impact on our business processes and information systems across a significant portion of our operations  including our finance operations 
as a result  we will experience significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting as our implementation progresses 
if we are unable to successfully implement this system  including harmonizing our systems  data and processes  our ability to process transactions accurately and efficiently may be affected  and any unsuccessful implementation could have an adverse effect on our capital resources  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
our results of operations could be materially harmed if we are unable to accurately match supply forecast with consumer demand for our products many factors may significantly affect demand for our products  including  among other things  economic conditions  fashion trends  consumer preferences and weather  making it difficult to accurately forecast demand for our products and our future results of operations 
to minimize our purchasing costs  the time necessary to fill customer orders and the risk of non delivery  we place a significant amount of orders for our products with independent factories prior to receiving all of our customers orders  and we maintain an inventory of various products that we anticipate will be in greater demand 
in addition  customers are generally allowed to cancel orders prior to shipment with sufficient notice 

table of contents factors that could affect our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products include an increase or decrease in consumer demand for our products or for products of our competitors  for certain demand and supply planning functions  we rely on manual processes and judgment that are subject to human error  our failure to accurately forecast customer acceptance of new products  new product introductions by competitors  unanticipated changes in general market conditions or other factors  which may result in cancellations of orders or a reduction or increase in the rate of reorders placed by retailers  and weak economic conditions or consumer confidence  which could reduce demand for discretionary items such as our products 
in some cases  our production orders may not match actual demand  which could result in our inability to deliver product in a timely manner  higher transportation costs to expedite delivery and higher inventory levels 
during periods of weak economic conditions we may experience a significant increase in the volume of order cancellations by our customers  including cancellations resulting from the bankruptcy  liquidation or contraction of certain customers operations 
we may not be able to sell all of the products we have ordered from independent factories or that we have in our inventory 
inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write downs and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices through discount direct to consumer channels  which could have a material adverse effect on our brand image  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
conversely  if we underestimate demand for our products or if our independent factories are unable to supply products when we need them  we may experience inventory shortages 
inventory shortages may prevent us from fulfilling customer orders  delay shipments to customers  negatively affect customer relationships  result in increased costs to expedite production and delivery  and diminish our ability to build brand loyalty 
shipments delayed due to limited factory capacity or other factors could result in order cancellations by our customers  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we may be adversely affected by weather conditions our business is adversely affected by unseasonable weather conditions 
a significant portion of the sales of our products is dependent in part on the weather and may decline in years in which weather conditions do not favor the use of these products 
periods of unseasonably warm weather in the fall or winter or unseasonably cold or wet weather in the spring and summer may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
inventory accumulation by our wholesale customers resulting from unseasonable weather in one season may negatively affect orders in future seasons  which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
our international operations involve many risks we are subject to the risks generally associated with doing business internationally 
these risks include the effects of foreign laws and regulations  changes in consumer preferences  foreign currency fluctuations  political unrest  terrorist acts  military operations  disruptions or delays in shipments  disease outbreaks and changes in economic conditions in countries in which we manufacture or sell products 
these factors  among others  may affect our ability to sell products in international markets  our ability to manufacture products or procure materials  and our cost of doing business 
if any of these or other factors make the conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impractical  our business may be materially and adversely affected 
as we expand our operations in geographic scope and product categories  we anticipate intellectual property disputes 
table of contents will increase as well  making it more expensive and challenging to establish and protect our intellectual property rights and to defend against claims of infringement by others 
as a global company  we determine our income tax liability in various competing tax jurisdictions based on a careful analysis and interpretation of local tax laws and regulations 
this analysis requires a significant amount of judgment and estimation and is often based on various assumptions about the future actions of the local tax authorities 
these determinations are the subject of periodic domestic and foreign tax audits 
although we accrue for uncertain tax positions  our accrual may be insufficient to satisfy unfavorable findings  which by their nature cannot be predicted with certainty 
unfavorable audit findings and tax rulings may result in payment of taxes  fines and penalties for prior periods and higher tax rates in future periods  which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
changes in tax law or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly affect the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 
moreover  if we encounter a significant need for liquidity domestically or at a particular location that we cannot fulfill through borrowings  equity offerings or other internal or external sources  we may experience unfavorable tax and earnings consequences as a result of cash transfers 
these adverse consequences would occur  for example  if the transfer of cash into the united states is taxed and no offsetting foreign tax credit is available to offset the us tax liability  resulting in lower earnings 
furthermore  we may be prohibited from transferring cash from a country such as china 
foreign exchange ceilings imposed by local governments and the sometimes lengthy approval processes that foreign governments require for international cash transfers may delay our internal cash transfers from time to time 
in addition  many of our imported products are subject to duties  tariffs or other import limitations that affect the cost and quantity of various types of goods imported into the united states or into our other sales markets 
any country in which our products are produced or sold may eliminate  adjust or impose new import limitations  duties  tariffs  anti dumping penalties or other charges or restrictions  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
our business and reputation may be adversely affected by actions of independent contractors we contract with many independent contractors outside of the united states to manufacture our products  and we also have license agreements that permit unaffiliated parties to manufacture or contract to manufacture products using our trademarks 
we impose  and require our licensees to impose  on those contractors standards of manufacturing practices and other environmental  health and safety standards for the benefit of workers and compliance with product safety and other laws 
however  from time to time contractors may not comply with these standards or applicable local law  or our licensees may not require their contractors to comply with these standards or applicable local law 
significant or continuing noncompliance with these standards and laws by one or more contractors could harm our reputation and  as a result  could have an adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we operate in very competitive markets the markets for outerwear  sportswear  footwear  accessories and equipment are highly competitive  as are the markets for our licensed products 
in each of our geographic markets  we face significant competition from global and regional branded apparel  footwear  accessories and equipment companies 
retailers who are our customers often pose our most significant competitive threat by marketing apparel  footwear and equipment under their own private labels 
for example  in the united states  several of our largest customers have developed significant private label brands during the past decade that compete directly with our products 
these retailers have assumed an increasing degree of inventory risk in their private label products and  as a result  may first cancel advance orders with us in order to manage their own inventory levels downward during weak economic cycles 

table of contents we also compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent factories that manufacture our products and for import capacity 
many of our competitors are significantly larger than us  have substantially greater financial  distribution  marketing and other resources than we have  and have achieved greater brand strength than we have 
increased competition may result in reduced access to production capacity  reductions in display areas in retail locations  reductions in sales  or reductions in our profit margins  any of which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we may be adversely affected by the financial health of our customers sluggish economies and consumer uncertainty regarding future economic prospects in our key markets have had an adverse effect on the financial health of our customers  some of whom have filed or may file for protection under bankruptcy laws  which may in turn have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we extend credit to our customers based on an assessment of the customer s financial condition  generally without requiring collateral 
to assist in the scheduling of production and the shipping of seasonal products  we offer customers discounts for placing advance orders and extended payment terms for taking delivery before the peak shipping season 
these extended payment terms increase our exposure to the risk of uncollectible receivables 
in addition  we face increased risk of order reduction or cancellation or reduced availability of credit insurance coverage when dealing with financially ailing retailers or retailers struggling with economic uncertainty 
some of our significant wholesale customers have liquidated or reorganized  while others have had financial difficulties in the past and have recently experienced tightened credit markets and sales declines and reduced profitability  which in turn has an adverse effect on our business 
we may reduce our level of business with customers experiencing financial difficulties and may not be able to replace that business with other customers  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we may be adversely affected by global credit market conditions economic downturns and economic uncertainty generally affect global credit markets 
our vendors  customers and other participants in our supply chain may require access to credit markets in order to do business 
credit market conditions may slow our collection efforts as customers find it more difficult to obtain necessary financing  leading to higher than normal accounts receivable 
this could result in greater expense associated with collection efforts and increased bad debt expense 
credit conditions may impair our vendors ability to finance the purchase of raw materials or general working capital needs to support our production requirements  resulting in a delay or non receipt of inventory shipments during key seasons 
historically we have limited our reliance on debt to finance our working capital  capital expenditures and investing activity requirements 
we expect to fund our future capital expenditures with existing cash  expected operating cash flows and credit facilities  but if the need arises to finance additional expenditures  we may need to seek additional funding 
our ability to obtain additional financing will depend on many factors  including prevailing market conditions  our financial condition  and our ability to negotiate favorable terms and conditions 
financing may not be available on terms that are acceptable or favorable to us  if at all 
we may be adversely affected by retailer consolidation when our wholesale customers combine their operations through mergers  acquisitions  or other transactions  their consolidated order volume may decrease while their bargaining power and the competitive threat they pose by marketing products under their own private labels may increase 
some of our significant customers have consolidated their operations in the past  which in turn has had a negative effect on our business 
future retailer consolidations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents we rely on technical innovation and functional design to compete in the market for our products technical innovation and functional design of footwear  apparel  and equipment is essential to distinguish our products in the marketplace and achieve commercial success 
research and development plays a key role in technical innovation 
we rely upon specialists in the fields of chemistry  biochemistry  engineering  industrial design  electronics and related fields  guided by consumer feedback  to develop and test innovative performance products 
although we are committed to designing innovative and functional products that deliver relevant performance benefits to consumers who participate in a wide range of competitive and recreational outdoor activities  if we fail to introduce technical innovation in our products that address consumers performance expectations  demand for our products could decline 
as we strive to achieve technical innovations  we face a greater risk of inadvertent infringements of third party rights or compliance issues 
in addition  technical innovations often involve more complex manufacturing processes 
more complex manufacturing processes may lead to higher instances of quality issues  and if we experience problems with the quality of our products  we may incur substantial expense to remedy the problems 
failure to successfully bring to market technical innovations in our product lines could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we face risks associated with consumer preferences and fashion trends changes in consumer preferences or consumer interest in outdoor activities may have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  changes in fashion trends may have a greater impact than in the past as we expand our offerings to include more product categories in more geographic areas 
we also face risks because our business requires us and our customers to anticipate consumer preferences 
our decisions about product designs often are made far in advance of consumer acceptance 
although we try to manage our inventory risk through early order commitments by retailers  we must generally place a significant portion of our seasonal production orders with our independent factories before we have received all of a season s orders  and orders may be cancelled by customers before shipment 
if we or our customers fail to anticipate and respond to consumer preferences  we may have lower sales  excess inventories and lower profit margins  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
our success depends on our use and protection of intellectual property rights our registered and common law trademarks and our patented or patent pending designs and technologies have significant value and are important to our ability to differentiate our products from our competitors and to create and sustain demand for our products 
we also place significant value on our trade dress  the overall appearance and image of our products 
from time to time  we discover products that are counterfeit reproductions of our products or that otherwise infringe on our proprietary rights 
counterfeiting activities typically increase as brand recognition increases  especially in markets outside the united states 
increased instances of counterfeit manufacture and sales may adversely affect our sales and our brand and result in a shift of consumer preference away from our products 
the actions we take to establish and protect trademarks and other proprietary rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as violations of proprietary rights 
in markets outside of the united states  it may be more difficult for us to establish our proprietary rights and to successfully challenge use of those rights by other parties 
we also license our proprietary rights to third parties 
failure to choose appropriate licensees and licensed product categories may dilute or harm our brand image 
in addition to our own intellectual property rights  many of the intellectual property rights in the technology  fabrics and processes used to manufacture our products are generally owned or controlled by our suppliers and are generally not unique to us 
in those cases  we may not be able to adequately protect our products or differentiate the performance characteristics and fabrications from those of our competitors 
actions or decisions in the management of our intellectual property portfolio may affect the strength of our brands  which may in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents although we have not been materially inhibited from selling products in connection with patent  trademark and trade dress disputes  as we focus on innovation in our product lines  extend our brands into new product categories and expand the geographic scope of our marketing  we may become subject to litigation based on allegations of the infringement of intellectual property rights of third parties  including third party trademark  copyright and patent rights 
an increasing number of our products include technologies and or designs for which we have obtained or applied for patent protection 
failure to successfully obtain and maintain patents on these innovations could negatively affect our ability to market and sell our products 
future litigation also may be necessary to defend against such claims or to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights 
any intellectual property litigation may be costly and may divert management s attention from the operation of our business 
adverse determinations in any litigation may result in the loss of our proprietary rights  subject us to significant liabilities or require us to seek licenses from third parties  which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
this may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
our success depends on our distribution facilities our ability to meet customer expectations  manage inventory  complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies depends on the proper operation of our existing distribution facilities  the development or expansion of additional distribution capabilities and the timely performance of services by third parties  including those involved in shipping product to and from our distribution facilities 
in the united states  we rely primarily on our distribution centers in portland  oregon and robards  kentucky  in canada  we rely primarily on our distribution facilities in strathroy  ontario  and in europe  we rely primarily on our distribution center in cambrai  france 
our distribution facilities in the united states and france are highly automated  which means that their operations are complicated and may be subject to a number of risks related to computer viruses  the proper operation of software and hardware  electronic or power interruptions  and other system failures 
risks associated with upgrading or expanding these facilities may significantly disrupt or increase the cost of our operations 
for example  in addition to supporting our traditional wholesale business  our existing distribution facilities have been modified to enable them to also support our new e commerce sales in the united states 
failure to successfully maintain and update these modifications could disrupt our wholesale and e commerce shipments and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
our current distribution facilities are designed to handle significantly greater volumes of product shipments than our business is currently generating  especially our european distribution center in cambrai  france 
the fixed costs associated with owning  operating and maintaining these large  highly automated distribution centers during a period of economic weakness or declining sales could result in lower operating efficiencies and financial deleverage 
this fixed cost structure may make it difficult for us to maintain profitability if sales volumes decline for an extended period of time and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
our distribution facilities may also be interrupted by disasters  such as earthquakes which are known to occur in the northwestern united states  tornadoes or fires 
we maintain business interruption insurance  but it may not adequately protect us from the adverse effect that may be caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities 
we may be adversely affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations although the majority of our product purchases are denominated in us dollars  the cost of these products may be affected by the relative changes in the value of the local currency of the manufacturer 
price increases caused by currency exchange rate fluctuations may make our products less competitive or have an adverse effect on our margins 
our international revenues and expenses generally are derived from sales and operations in currencies other than the us dollar 
because the functional currency of many of our subsidiaries is not the us 
table of contents dollar  we are exposed to potentially material gains or losses from the remeasurement of us dollar monetary transactions into the respective functional currencies 
currency exchange rate fluctuations may also disrupt the business of the independent factories that produce our products by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance 
as a result  currency fluctuations may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
our investments may be adversely affected by market conditions our investment portfolio is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties 
changes in market conditions  such as those that accompany an economic downturn or economic uncertainty  may negatively affect the value and liquidity of our investment portfolio  perhaps significantly 
our ability to find diversified investments that are both safe and liquid and that provide a reasonable return may be impaired  resulting in lower interest income  less diversification  longer investment maturities and or higher other than temporary impairments 
we may be adversely affected by labor disruptions our business depends on our ability to source and distribute products in a timely manner 
labor disputes at independent factories where our goods are produced  shipping ports  transportation carriers  retail stores or distribution centers create significant risks for our business  particularly if these disputes result in work slowdowns  lockouts  strikes  or other disruptions during our peak manufacturing and importing seasons  and may have a material adverse effect on our business  potentially resulting in cancelled orders by customers  unanticipated inventory accumulation  and reduced revenues and earnings 
we depend on key suppliers some of the materials that we use may be available from only one source or a very limited number of sources 
for example  some specialty fabrics are manufactured to our specification by one source or a few sources  and a single vendor supplies substantially all of the zippers used in our products 
from time to time  we have difficulty satisfying our raw material and finished goods requirements 
although we believe that we can identify and qualify additional independent factories to produce these materials as necessary  there are no guarantees that additional independent factories will be available 
in addition  depending on the timing  any changes may result in increased costs or production delays  which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we depend on key personnel our future success will depend in part on the continued service of key personnel and our ability to attract  retain and develop key managers  designers  sales people and others 
we face intense competition for these individuals worldwide  and there is a significant concentration of well funded apparel and footwear competitors in and around our headquarters in portland  oregon 
we may not be able to attract qualified new employees or retain existing employees  which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
our business is affected by seasonality our business is affected by the general seasonal trends common to the outdoor apparel industry 
our products are marketed on a seasonal basis and our product mix is weighted substantially toward the fall season 
our annual net sales are weighted more heavily toward the fall winter season  while our operating expenses are more equally distributed throughout the year 
as a result  the majority of our operating profits are generated in the second half of the year 
the expansion of our direct to consumer operations has had a modest effect on the seasonality of our business  increasing the proportion of sales and profits that we generate in the fourth calendar quarter 
this seasonality  along with other factors that are beyond our control and that are discussed elsewhere in this section  may adversely affect our business and cause our results of operations to fluctuate 
results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period 

table of contents our products are subject to increasing product regulations and we face risks of product liability and warranty claims our products are subject to increasingly stringent and complex domestic and foreign product labeling and performance and safety standards  laws and other regulations 
these requirements could result in greater expense associated with compliance efforts  and failure to comply with these regulations could result in a delay  non delivery or mandated recall or destruction of inventory shipments during key seasons or in other financial penalties 
significant or continuing noncompliance with these standards and laws could harm our reputation and  as a result  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
our products are used in outdoor activities  sometimes in severe conditions 
product recalls or product liability claims in the future  resulting from the alleged failure of our products  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
some of our products carry warranties for defects in quality and workmanship 
we maintain a warranty reserve for future warranty claims  but the actual costs of servicing future warranty claims may exceed the reserve  which may also have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
our common stock price may be volatile the price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially since our initial public offering 
our common stock is traded on the nasdaq global select market 
factors such as general market conditions  fluctuations in financial results  variances from financial market expectations  changes in earnings estimates by analysts  or announcements by us or our competitors may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate  perhaps substantially 
insiders control a majority of our common stock and may sell shares three related shareholders  timothy boyle  gertrude boyle and sarah bany  beneficially own a majority of our common stock 
as a result  if acting together  they can effectively control matters requiring shareholder approval without the cooperation of other shareholders 
shares held by these three insiders are available for resale  subject to the requirements of  and the rules under  the securities act of and the securities exchange act of the sale or the prospect of the sale of a substantial number of these shares may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock

forward looking statements include any statements related to our expectations regarding future performance or market position  including any statements regarding anticipated sales across markets  distribution channels and product categories  access to raw materials and factory capacity  financing and working capital requirements and resources and our exposure to market risk associated with interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
these forward looking statements  and others we make from time to time  are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties 
many factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in forward looking statements  including the risks described above in item a  risk factors 
we do not undertake any duty either to update forward looking statements after the date they are made or to conform them to actual results or to changes in circumstances or expectations 
our business as one of the largest outdoor apparel and footwear companies in the world  we design  source  market and distribute active outdoor apparel  footwear  accessories and equipment under the columbia  mountain hardwear  sorel and montrail brands 
our products are sold through a mix of wholesale distribution channels  independent distributors  our own direct to consumer channels and licensees 
the popularity of outdoor activities  changing design trends and consumer adoption of innovative performance technologies affect consumer desire for our products 
therefore  we seek to anticipate and respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of available product offerings  developing new products with innovative performance features and designs  and creating persuasive and memorable marketing communications to drive consumer awareness and demand 
failure to anticipate or respond to consumer needs and preferences in a timely and adequate manner could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability 
seasonality and variability of business our business is affected by the general seasonal trends common to the outdoor industry and is heavily dependent upon discretionary consumer spending patterns 
our products are marketed on a seasonal basis and our product mix is weighted substantially toward the fall season  resulting in sales and profits being highest in the third calendar quarter 
the expansion of our own direct to consumer operations beginning in has increased the proportion of sales and profits that we generate in the fourth calendar quarter 
in and  our profits were earned entirely in the second half of the year  reflecting the dependence upon our sales results in the latter part of the year as well as a higher fixed cost structure of our business 
results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period  particularly in light of persistent volatility in economic conditions 
sales of our products are subject to substantial cyclical fluctuation  the effects of unseasonable weather conditions  and the continued popularity of outdoor activities as part of an active lifestyle in key markets 
the current economic environment in key markets  coupled with challenging capacity constraints across the independent manufacturing and transportation segments of our supply chain  reduced the predictability of our business throughout and into 
table of contents business outlook the business climate continues to present us with a great deal of uncertainty  with a number of variables that we rely on for planning purposes moving in opposing directions making it more difficult to predict future results 
factors that could significantly affect our outlook include unseasonable weather conditions affecting consumer demand and the resulting effect on order cancellations and reorders  changes in mix and volume of full price sales in contrast with closeout product sales  manufacturing and or transportation capacity constraints  the variability of input costs across our supply chain  costs of expedited transportation  incremental sales through our expanding direct to consumer operations  which are not included in backlog  changes in consumer spending activity and sales fluctuations in our own retail stores  and fluctuating currency exchange rates 
like other branded consumer product companies  our business is heavily dependent upon discretionary consumer spending patterns 
continuing high levels of unemployment in our key markets and restricted credit markets for consumers and retailers continue to pose significant challenges and risks 
as a result  a more cautious approach by our wholesale customers may persist  resulting in risk of reduction  delay or cancellation of advance orders prior to shipment 
over the past two years we have made significant investments in our go to market process to position us for growth 
among other things we have sharpened our focus on product innovation  built a multi channel direct to consumer platform  including expanded retail store and e commerce operations  refocused our marketing efforts behind new brand campaigns and media strategies for each of our major brands  and restructured our sales organizations to build relationships with new partners and strengthen those with existing accounts 
as a result of these continuing efforts  we expect our operating expense levels to increase compared to in addition  we have begun to make improvements to our operational processes  involving significant investments in initiatives to improve our information technology infrastructure and our enterprise data and information management across our organization  which is designed to improve operational flexibility and performance across our supply chain 
these investments are the foundation for a multi year implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning  or erp  system which began in late and will accelerate in and beyond 
wholesale backlog we generally solicit orders from wholesale customers and independent distributors for the fall and spring seasons by march and september  respectively  based on ordering deadlines that we establish to aid our efforts to plan manufacturing volumes to meet demand for each of our selling seasons 
twice each year we report our backlog of advance orders  representing the results of these seasonal order taking processes 

table of contents we typically ship the majority of our advance fall season orders to wholesale customers and independent distributors beginning in late june and continuing through october 
similarly  the majority of our advance spring season orders ship to wholesale customers and independent distributors beginning in late december and continuing through late april 
generally  orders are subject to cancellation prior to the date of shipment

our spring wholesale backlog reflects growth across each major brand  product category and region

by brand  the spring wholesale backlog increase was led by the columbia brand  followed by the sorel brand and the mountain hardwear brand 
wholesale backlog does not include anticipated sales to consumers through our own direct to consumer channels 
although we cannot predict with certainty any future results  our reported spring wholesale backlog is one indicator of our anticipated net sales for the spring selling season 
many factors  however  could cause actual wholesale sales to differ materially from the reported spring wholesale backlog  including the potential cancellation of orders by customers  capacity constraints at our independent manufacturing partners facilities resulting in delivery delays  changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in macro economic conditions 
moreover  our spring wholesale backlog should not be used in forecasting sales beyond the spring selling season

to fund our domestic working capital requirements  we have an unsecured  committed million revolving line of credit available 
we entered into this credit agreement effective june  at december   no balance was outstanding under this line of credit and we were in compliance with all associated covenants 
internationally  our subsidiaries have local currency operating lines of credit in place guaranteed by the parent company with a combined limit of approximately million at december   of which million is designated as a european customs guarantee 
at december   no balance was outstanding under these lines of credit 
we expect to fund our future capital expenditures with existing cash  operating cash flows and credit facilities 
if the need arises  we may need to seek additional funding 
our ability to obtain additional financing will depend on many factors  including prevailing market conditions  our financial condition  and our ability to negotiate favorable terms and conditions 
financing may not be available on terms that are acceptable or favorable to us  if at all 
our operations are affected by seasonal trends typical in the outdoor apparel industry  and have historically resulted in higher sales and profits in the third and fourth calendar quarters 
this pattern has resulted primarily from the timing of shipments of fall season products to wholesale customers and proportionally higher sales from our direct to consumer operations in the fourth quarter 
we believe that our liquidity requirements for at least the next months will be adequately covered by existing cash  cash provided by operations and existing short term borrowing arrangements 
the following table presents our estimated contractual commitments in thousands year ended december  thereafter total inventory purchase obligations operating leases see inventory purchase obligations in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
see operating leases in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we have recorded liabilities for net unrecognized tax benefits related to income tax uncertainties in our consolidated balance sheet at december  of approximately million  however  they have not been included in the table above because we are uncertain about whether or when these amounts may be settled 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  our financial position and results of operations are routinely subject to a variety of risks 
these risks include risks associated with global financial and capital markets  primarily exchange rate risk and  to a lesser extent  interest rate risk and equity market risk 
we regularly assess these risks and have established policies and business practices designed to result in an appropriate level of protection against an adverse effect of these risks 
we do not engage in speculative trading in any financial or capital market 
our primary exchange rate risk management objective is to mitigate the uncertainty of anticipated cash flows attributable to changes in exchange rates 
we focus on mitigating changes in functional currency equivalent cash flows resulting from anticipated us dollar denominated inventory purchases by subsidiaries that use european euros  canadian dollars  japanese yen or korean won as their functional currency 
we manage this risk primarily by using currency forward and option contracts 
additionally  we use foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge net balance sheet exposures related primarily to intercompany loan agreements and payables 
the fair value of our hedging contracts was unfavorable by approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
a change in the euro  canadian dollar  yen and won exchange rates would have resulted in the fair value fluctuating approximately million at december  and million at december  changes in fair value resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations would be substantially offset by the change in value of the underlying hedged transactions 
our investments in fixed rate bonds create an interest rate risk exposure for us 
fluctuations in short term interest rates cause the fair values of these bonds to increase or decrease which in turn creates unrealized gain losses in other comprehensive income 
we do not currently mitigate this risk through the use of interest rate derivatives such as fixed to floating swaps 
despite classifying these as available for sale  we have the general intent and ability to hold these investments to maturity 
at december  we had million carrying value of fixed rate bonds 
unrealized gain losses were not material 
our negotiated credit facilities generally charge interest based on a benchmark rate such as the london interbank offered rate libor 
fluctuations in short term interest rates cause interest payments on drawn amounts to increase or decrease 
at december   our credit facilities did not have an outstanding balance 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make various estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
we believe that the estimates and assumptions involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates 
because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters  actual results may differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies 
we base our ongoing estimates on historical experience and other various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable in the circumstances 
many of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account balances  including the policy for revenue recognition  the allowance for doubtful accounts  the provision for potential excess  closeout and slow moving inventory  product warranty  income taxes and stock based compensation 
management regularly discusses with our audit committee each of our critical accounting estimates  the development and selection of these accounting estimates  and the disclosure about each estimate in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
these discussions typically occur at our quarterly audit committee meetings and include the basis and methodology used in 
table of contents developing and selecting these estimates  the trends in and amounts of these estimates  specific matters affecting the amount of and changes in these estimates  and any other relevant matters related to these estimates  including significant issues concerning accounting principles and financial statement presentation 
revenue recognition we record wholesale  e commerce and licensed product revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer 
title generally passes upon shipment to or upon receipt by the customer depending on the terms of sale with the customer 
retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale 
where title passes upon receipt by the customer  predominantly in our western european wholesale business  precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available 
in these cases  we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based on historical and expected delivery times by geographic location 
we periodically test the accuracy of these estimates based on actual transactions 
delivery times vary by geographic location  generally from one to six days 
to date  we have found these estimates to be materially accurate 
at the time of revenue recognition  we also provide for estimated sales returns and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues 
the estimates are based on historical rates of product returns and claims 
however  actual returns and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from the estimates 
if actual or expected future returns and claims are significantly greater or lower than the reserves that we have established  we will record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we make such a determination 
allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable we make ongoing estimates of the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
in determining the amount of the allowance  we consider our historical level of credit losses and we make judgments about the creditworthiness of customers based on ongoing credit evaluations 
we analyze specific customer accounts  customer concentrations  credit insurance coverage  standby letters of credit  current economic trends  and changes in customer payment terms 
continued uncertainty in credit and market conditions may slow our collection efforts if customers experience difficulty accessing credit and paying their obligations  leading to higher than normal accounts receivable and increased bad debt expense 
because we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers  actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates and may have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates and results in their inability to make payments  a larger allowance may be required 
if we determine that a smaller or larger allowance is appropriate  we will record a credit or a charge to sg a expense in the period in which we make such a determination 
inventory obsolescence we make ongoing estimates of potential future excess  close out or slow moving inventory 
we evaluate our inventory on hand considering our purchase commitments  sales forecasts  and historical experience to identify excess  close out or slow moving inventory and make provisions as necessary to properly reflect inventory value at the lower of cost or estimated market value 
if we determine that a smaller or larger reserve is appropriate  we will record a credit or a charge to cost of sales in the period in which we make such a determination 
product warranty we make ongoing estimates of potential future product warranty costs 
when we evaluate our reserve for warranty costs  we consider our historical claim rates by season  product mix  current economic trends  and the 
table of contents historical cost to repair  replace  or refund the original sale 
if we determine that a smaller or larger reserve is appropriate  we will record a credit or a charge to cost of sales in the period in which we make such a determination 
income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  we recognize income tax expense for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for the amount of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
we make assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and our uncertain tax positions 
our judgments  assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
changes in tax law or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly affect the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income 
actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could cause our current assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes to be inaccurate 
changes in any of the assumptions  judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates  which could materially affect our financial position and results of operations 
our tax provision for interim periods is determined using an estimate of our annual effective tax rate  adjusted for discrete items  if any  that are taken into account in the relevant period 
as the calendar year progresses  we periodically refine our estimate based on actual events and earnings by jurisdiction 
this ongoing estimation process can result in changes to our expected effective tax rate for the full calendar year 
when this occurs  we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that our year to date provision equals our expected annual effective tax rate 
stock based compensation stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award s fair value and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period using the straight line attribution method 
we estimate stock based compensation for stock awards granted using the black scholes option pricing model  which requires various highly subjective assumptions  including volatility and expected option life 
further  we estimate forfeitures for stock based awards granted  which are not expected to vest 
if any of these inputs or assumptions changes significantly  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period
