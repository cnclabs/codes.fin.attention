item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we begin management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations with an overview of our key operating business segments and significant trends  including changes to our business as a result of our acquisition of sun microsystems  inc sun in fiscal this overview is followed by a summary of our critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results 
we then provide a more detailed analysis of our results of operations and financial condition 
business overview we are the world s largest enterprise software company and a leading provider of computer hardware products and services 
we develop  manufacture  market  distribute and service database and middleware software  applications software  and hardware systems  consisting primarily of computer server and storage products 
our products are built on industry standards and are engineered to work together or independently within existing customer information technology it  including private and public cloud computing  environments 
we offer customers secure  reliable  and scalable integrated software and hardware solutions that are designed to improve business efficiencies and more easily adapt to an organization s unique needs  at a lower total cost of ownership 
we seek to be an industry leader in each of the specific product categories in which we compete and to expand into new and emerging markets 
we believe our internal growth and continued innovation with respect to our software  hardware and services businesses are the foundation of our long term strategic plans 
an important element of our continued innovation and product strategy is to focus the engineering of our hardware and software products to make them work together more effectively and deliver improved computing performance  reliability and security to our customers 
our oracle exadata database machine and oracle exalogic elastic cloud products exemplify this strategy and are currently two of our most important products 
both products combine certain of our hardware and software offerings to provide an engineered system that increases computing performance relative to our competitors products  creating time savings and operational cost advantages for our customers 
in fiscal  and we invested billion  billion and billion  respectively  in research and development to enhance our existing portfolio of products and services and to develop new products and services 
we also believe that an active acquisition program is an important element of our corporate strategy as it strengthens our competitive position  enhances the products and services that we can offer to customers  expands our customer base  provides greater scale to accelerate innovation  grows our revenues and earnings  and increases stockholder value 
in recent years  we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of companies  products  services and technologies that add to  are complementary to  or have otherwise enhanced our existing offerings 
we expect to continue to acquire companies  products  services and technologies in furtherance of our corporate strategy 
we are organized into three businesses software  hardware systems and services which are further divided into seven operating segments 
each of these businesses and operating segments has unique characteristics and faces different opportunities and challenges 
although we report our actual results in us dollars  we conduct a significant number of transactions in currencies other than us dollars 
therefore  we present constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations 
an overview of our three businesses and seven operating segments follows 
software business our software business  which represented  and of our total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively  is comprised of two operating segments new software licenses and software license updates and product support 
on a constant currency basis  we expect that our software business total revenues generally will continue to increase due to continued demand for our software products and software license updates and product support offerings  including the high percentage of customers that renew their software license updates and product support contracts  and due to our acquisitions  which should allow us to grow our profits and continue to make investments in research and development 

table of contents new software licenses we license our database and middleware as well as our applications software to businesses of many sizes  government agencies  educational institutions and resellers 
the growth in new software license revenues that we report is affected by the strength of general economic and business conditions  governmental budgetary constraints  the competitive position of our software products  our acquisitions and foreign currency fluctuations 
the substantial majority of our new software license business is also characterized by long sales cycles 
the timing of a few large software license transactions can substantially affect our quarterly new software license revenues 
since our new software license revenues in a particular quarter can be difficult to predict as a result of the timing of a few large software license transactions  we believe that analysis of new software license revenues on a trailing quarter period as provided in our quarterly reports on form q provides additional visibility into the underlying performance of our new software license business 
new software license revenues represented  and of our total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
the proportion of our new software license revenues relative to our total revenues in fiscal and was affected by our entry into the hardware systems business as a result of our acquisition of sun 
our new software license segment s margins have historically trended upward over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year due to the historical upward trend of our new software license revenues over those quarterly periods and because the majority of our costs for this segment are predominantly fixed in the short term 
however  our new software license segment s margins have been and will continue to be affected by the amortization of intangible assets associated with companies that we have acquired 
software license updates and product support customers that purchase software license updates and product support are granted rights to unspecified product upgrades and maintenance releases issued during the support period  as well as technical support assistance 
substantially all of our customers renew their software license updates and product support contracts annually 
the growth of software license updates and product support revenues is primarily influenced by three factors the percentage of our support contract customer base that renews its support contracts  the amount of new support contracts sold in connection with the sale of new software licenses  and the amount of support contracts assumed from companies we have acquired 
software license updates and product support revenues  which represented  and of our total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively  is our highest margin business unit 
the proportion of our software license updates and product support revenues relative to our total revenues in fiscal and was affected by our entry into the hardware systems business as a result of our acquisition of sun 
support margins during fiscal were and accounted for of our total margins 
our software license update and product support margins have been affected by fair value adjustments relating to support obligations assumed in business combinations described further below and by amortization of intangible assets 
however  over the longer term  we believe that software license updates and product support revenues and margins will grow for the following reasons substantially all of our customers  including customers from acquired companies  renew their support contracts when eligible for renewal  substantially all of our customers purchase software license updates and product support contracts when they buy new software licenses  resulting in a further increase in our support contract base 
even if new software license revenues growth was flat  software license updates and product support revenues would continue to grow in comparison to the corresponding prior year periods assuming renewal and cancellation rates and foreign currency rates remained relatively constant since substantially all new software license transactions result in the sale of software license updates and product support contracts  which add to our support contract base  and our acquisitions have increased our support contract base  as well as the portfolio of products available to be licensed and supported 
we recorded adjustments to reduce support obligations assumed in business combinations to their estimated fair values at the acquisition dates 
as a result  as required by business combination accounting rules  we did not recognize software license updates and product support revenues related to support contracts that would have been otherwise recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in the amount of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
to the extent underlying support contracts 
table of contents are renewed with us following an acquisition  we will recognize the revenues for the full value of the support contracts over the support periods  the majority of which are one year 
hardware systems business as a result of our acquisition of sun in january  we entered into a new hardware systems business 
our hardware systems business consists of two operating segments hardware systems products and hardware systems support 
our hardware business represented and of our total revenues in fiscal and  respectively  and we expect that it will continue to add a significant amount of revenues and expenses to our results of operations in comparison to our historical operating results 
we expect our hardware business to have lower operating margins as a percentage of revenues than our software business due to the incremental costs we incur to produce and distribute these products and to provide support services  including direct materials and labor costs 
we expect to make investments in research and development to improve existing hardware products and services or develop new hardware products and services 
to produce our hardware products  we rely on both our internal manufacturing operations as well as third party manufacturing partners 
our internal manufacturing operations consist primarily of final assembly  test and quality control of enterprise and data center servers and storage systems 
for all other manufacturing  we rely on third party manufacturing partners 
we distribute most of our hardware products either from our facilities or partner facilities 
we are continuing to focus on reducing costs by simplifying our manufacturing processes through increased standardization of components across product types  through a reduction of the number of assembly and distribution centers that we rely on and a build to order manufacturing process in which products are built only after customers have placed firm orders 
in addition  we are focusing on identifying hardware systems support processes that are intended to proactively identify and solve quality issues and to increase the amount of new hardware systems support contracts sold in connection with the sales of new hardware products 
hardware systems products our hardware systems products consist primarily of computer server and storage product offerings and hardware related software  including our oracle solaris operating system 
our hardware systems component products are designed to be open  or to work in customer environments that may include other oracle or non oracle hardware or software components 
we have also engineered our hardware systems products to create performance and operational cost advantages for customers when our hardware and software products are combined as engineered systems  as with oracle exadata and oracle exalogic elastic cloud 
we offer a wide range of server systems using our sparc microprocessor 
our sparc servers are differentiated by their reliability  security  scalability and customer environments that they target general purpose or specialized systems 
our midsize and large servers are designed to offer greater performance and lower total cost of ownership than mainframe systems for business critical applications and for customers having more computationally intensive needs 
our sparc servers run the oracle solaris operating system and are designed for the most demanding mission critical enterprise environments at any scale 
we also offer a wide range of x servers 
these x servers are primarily based on microprocessor platforms from intel corporation and are also compatible with oracle solaris  oracle linux  microsoft windows and other operating systems 
our storage products are designed to securely manage  protect  archive and restore customers mission critical data assets and consist of tape  disk  hardware related software including file systems software  back up and archive software and storage management software  and networking for mainframe and open systems environments 
the majority of our hardware systems products are sold through indirect channels  including independent distributors and value added resellers 
we have enhanced direct sales coverage for our hardware systems products and intend that our direct sales force will sell proportionately more of our hardware systems products in the future than they do currently 
our hardware systems products revenues  cost of hardware systems products and operating margins that we report are affected by the strength of general economic and business conditions  governmental budgetary constraints  the competitive position of our hardware systems products  and our acquisitions and foreign currency 
table of contents fluctuations 
in addition  our operating margins for our hardware systems products segment have been and will be affected by the amortization of intangible assets associated with our acquisition of sun and by business combination accounting rules that required us to record acquired inventories from sun at fair value  which resulted in an unfavorable impact to our expenses and operating margins as we sold these inventories to customers during fiscal we have limited experience in predicting our quarterly hardware systems products revenues 
the timing of customer orders and delays in our ability to timely manufacture or deliver a few large transactions could substantially affect the amount of hardware systems products revenues  expenses and operating margins that we report 
hardware systems support customers that purchase our hardware systems products may also elect to purchase our hardware systems support offerings 
our hardware systems support offerings provide customers with software updates for the software components that are essential to the functionality of our server and storage products  such as oracle solaris  and can include product repairs  maintenance services  and technical support services 
typically  our hardware systems support contract arrangements are invoiced to the customer at the beginning of the support period and are one year in duration 
the growth of our hardware systems support revenues is influenced by a number of factors  including the volume of purchases of hardware products  the mix of hardware products purchased  and the percentage of our hardware systems support contract customer base that renews its support contracts 
all of these factors are heavily influenced by our customers decisions to either maintain or upgrade their existing hardware systems infrastructure to newly developed technologies that are available 
our hardware systems support margins have been and will be affected by fair value adjustments relating to hardware systems support obligations assumed through  and by the amortization of intangible assets resulting from  our acquisition of sun 
as required by business combination accounting rules  we recorded adjustments to reduce our hardware systems support revenues for contracts assumed from our acquisition of sun to their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date by an aggregate of million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
these amounts would have been recorded as hardware systems support revenues by sun as a standalone entity 
to the extent underlying hardware systems support contracts are renewed with us following an acquisition  we will recognize the revenues for the full values of the hardware systems support contracts over the support periods 
services business our services business consists of consulting  cloud services and education 
as a result of our acquisition of sun  we expanded and enhanced our customer base and services offerings  which we believe will increase our revenues and expenses in comparison to recent periods 
our services business  which represented  and of our total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively  has significantly lower margins than our software business and what we have recently achieved from our hardware business 
the proportion of our services revenues relative to our total revenues in fiscal and was affected by our entry into the hardware systems business as a result of our acquisition of sun 
consulting our consulting line of business primarily provides services to customers in business and it strategy alignment  enterprise architecture planning and design  initial product implementation and integration  and ongoing product enhancements and upgrades 
the amount of consulting revenues recognized tends to lag the amount of our software and hardware systems products revenues by several quarters since consulting services  if purchased  are typically segmentable from the products with which they relate and are performed after the customer s purchase of the products 
our consulting revenues are dependent upon general economic conditions and the level of our product revenues  in particular the new software license sales of our application products 
to the extent we are able to grow our products revenues  in particular our software application product revenues  we would also generally expect to be able to eventually grow our consulting revenues 
cloud services our cloud services segment  which was formerly named on demand  includes certain of our oracle cloud services offerings and technology  and advanced customer services 
as a result of our acquisition of sun  we increased the volume and breadth of our cloud services offerings 
oracle cloud services are 
table of contents designed to provide comprehensive software and hardware management and maintenance services for customers hosted at our oracle data center facilities  select partner data centers or physically on site at customer facilities 
advanced customer services provides support services  both onsite and remote  to oracle customers to enable increased performance and higher availability of their products and services 
we believe that our cloud services offerings provide our customers with increased business performance  reduced risk  a predictable cost and more flexibility and choice in terms of service in order to maximize the performance of their oracle software and hardware products and services 
while we have grown the base of customers that purchase certain of our cloud services through our organic growth and the acquisition of sun  we continue to focus on managing our expenses to increase our margins and margins as a percentage of our revenues 
we have made and plan to continue to make investments in our cloud services businesses to support current and future revenue growth  which historically has negatively impacted cloud services margins and could do so in the future 
education the purpose of our education services is to further the adoption and usage of our software and hardware products by our customers and to create opportunities to grow our product revenues 
education revenues are impacted by certain of our acquisitions  general economic conditions  personnel reductions in our customers information technology departments  tighter controls over discretionary spending and greater use of outsourcing solutions 
acquisitions an active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy 
in recent years  we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of complementary companies  products  services and technologies including art technology group  inc atg and phase forward incorporated phase forward in fiscal and sun in fiscal  among others 
we believe our acquisition program strengthens our competitive position  enhances the products and services that we can offer to customers  expands our customer base  provides greater scale to accelerate innovation  grows our revenues and earnings  and increases stockholder value 
we expect to continue to acquire companies  products  services and technologies in furtherance of our corporate strategy 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for additional information related to our recent acquisitions 
we believe we can fund our pending and future acquisitions with our internally available cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  cash generated from operations  additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities 
we estimate the financial impact of any potential acquisition with regard to earnings  operating margin  cash flow and return on invested capital targets before deciding to move forward with an acquisition 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap as set forth in the financial accounting standards board s fasb accounting standards codification codification and consider the various staff accounting bulletins and other applicable guidance issued by the sec 
gaap  as set forth within the codification  requires us to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions 
we believe that the estimates  judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates  judgments and assumptions are made 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates  judgments or assumptions and actual results  our financial statements will be affected 
the accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates  judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition business combinations goodwill and intangible assets impairment assessments 
table of contents accounting for income taxes legal and other contingencies stock based compensation allowances for doubtful accounts in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap and does not require management s judgment in its application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result 
our senior management has reviewed the below critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the finance and audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition our sources of revenues include software  which includes new software license revenues and software license updates and product support revenues  hardware systems  which includes the sale of hardware systems products including computer servers and storage products  and hardware systems support revenues  and services  which include software and hardware related services including consulting  cloud services and education revenues 
revenue recognition for software products and software related services software elements new software license revenues represent fees earned from granting customers licenses to use our database  middleware and applications software  and exclude revenues derived from software license updates  which are included in software license updates and product support revenues 
while the basis for software license revenue recognition is substantially governed by the accounting guidance contained in asc  software revenue recognition  we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of software and services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period 
for software license arrangements that do not require significant modification or customization of the underlying software  we recognize new software license revenues when we enter into a legally binding arrangement with a customer for the license of software  we deliver the products  the sale price is fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties  and collection is probable 
revenues that are not recognized at the time of sale because the foregoing conditions are not met are recognized when those conditions are subsequently met 
substantially all of our software license arrangements do not include acceptance provisions 
however  if acceptance provisions exist as part of public policy  for example  in agreements with government entities where acceptance periods are required by law  or within previously executed terms and conditions that are referenced in the current agreement and are short term in nature  we generally recognize revenues upon delivery provided the acceptance terms are perfunctory and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
if acceptance provisions are not perfunctory for example  acceptance provisions that are long term in nature or are not included as standard terms of an arrangement  revenues are recognized upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
the vast majority of our software license arrangements include software license updates and product support contracts  which are entered into at the customer s option and are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement  typically one year 
software license updates provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades  maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period 
product support includes internet access to technical content  as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel 
software license updates and product support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net new software license fees 
substantially all of our customers renew their software license updates and product support contracts annually 

table of contents revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements software products and software related services software arrangements we often enter into arrangements with customers that purchase both software related products and services from us at the same time  or within close proximity of one another referred to as software related multiple element arrangements 
such software related multiple element arrangements include the sale of our software products  software license updates and product support contracts and other software related services whereby software license delivery is followed by the subsequent or contemporaneous delivery of the other elements 
for those software related multiple element arrangements  we have applied the residual method to determine the amount of software license revenues to be recognized pursuant to asc under the residual method  if fair value exists for undelivered elements in a multiple element arrangement  such fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred with the remaining portion of the arrangement consideration recognized upon delivery of the software license or services arrangement 
we allocate the fair value of each element of a software related multiple element arrangement based upon its fair value as determined by our vendor specific objective evidence vsoe described further below  with any remaining amount allocated to the software license 
revenue recognition for hardware systems products and hardware systems related services nonsoftware elements revenues from the sale of hardware systems products represent amounts earned primarily from the sale of computer servers and storage products 
our revenue recognition policy for these nonsoftware deliverables is based upon the accounting guidance contained in asc  revenue recognition  and we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of hardware systems products and hardware systems related services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period 
revenues from the sales of hardware products are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  we deliver the products and passage of the title to the buyer occurs  the sale price is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
revenues that are not recognized at the time of sale because the foregoing conditions are not met are recognized when those conditions are subsequently met 
when applicable  we reduce revenues for estimated returns or certain other incentive programs where we have the ability to sufficiently estimate the effects of these items 
where an arrangement is subject to acceptance criteria and the acceptance provisions are not perfunctory for example  acceptance provisions that are long term in nature or are not included as standard terms of an arrangement  revenues are recognized upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
our hardware systems support offerings generally provide customers with software updates for the software components that are essential to the functionality of our systems and storage products and can also include product repairs  maintenance services  and technical support services 
hardware systems support contracts are entered into at the customer s option and are recognized ratably over the contractual term of the arrangements 
revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements hardware systems products and hardware systems related services nonsoftware arrangements beginning in fiscal  we have applied the provisions of accounting standards update no 
 revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements and accounting standards update  software topic certain revenue arrangements that include software elements to our multiple element arrangements 
we enter into arrangements with customers that purchase both nonsoftware related products and services from us at the same time  or within close proximity of one another referred to as nonsoftware multiple element arrangements 
each element within a nonsoftware multiple element arrangement is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting provided the following criteria are met the delivered products or services have value to the customer on a standalone basis  and for an arrangement that includes a general right of return relative to the delivered products or services  delivery or performance of the undelivered product or service is considered probable and is substantially controlled by us 
we consider a deliverable to have standalone value if the product or service is sold separately by us or another vendor or could be resold by the customer 
further  our revenue 
table of contents arrangements generally do not include a general right of return relative to the delivered products 
where the aforementioned criteria for a separate unit of accounting are not met  the deliverable is combined with the undelivered element s and treated as a single unit of accounting for the purposes of allocation of the arrangement consideration and revenue recognition 
for those units of accounting that include more than one deliverable but are treated as a single unit of accounting  we generally recognize revenues over the delivery period 
for the purposes of revenue classification of the elements that are accounted for as a single unit of accounting  we allocate revenue to hardware systems and services based on a rational and consistent methodology utilizing our best estimate of fair value of such elements 
for our nonsoftware multiple element arrangements  we allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy at the arrangement inception 
the selling price for each element is based upon the following selling price hierarchy vsoe if available  third party evidence tpe if vsoe is not available  or estimated selling price esp if neither vsoe nor tpe are available a description as to how we determine vsoe  tpe and esp is provided below 
if a tangible hardware systems product includes software  we determine whether the tangible hardware systems product and the software work together to deliver the product s essential functionality and  if so  the entire product is treated as a nonsoftware deliverable 
the total arrangement consideration is allocated to each separate unit of accounting for each of the nonsoftware deliverables using the relative selling prices of each unit based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy 
we limit the amount of revenue recognized for delivered elements to an amount that is not contingent upon future delivery of additional products or services or meeting of any specified performance conditions 
to determine the selling price in multiple element arrangements  we establish vsoe of selling price using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately and for software license updates and product support and hardware systems support  based on the renewal rates offered to customers 
for nonsoftware multiple element arrangements  tpe is established by evaluating similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone arrangements with similarly situated customers 
if we are unable to determine the selling price because vsoe or tpe doesn t exist  we determine esp for the purposes of allocating the arrangement by reviewing historical transactions  including transactions whereby the deliverable was sold on a standalone basis and considering several other external and internal factors including  but not limited to  pricing practices including discounting  margin objectives  competition  the geographies in which we offer our products and services  the type of customer ie distributor  value added reseller  government agency and direct end user  among others and the stage of the product lifecycle 
the determination of esp is made through consultation with and approval by our management  taking into consideration our pricing model and go to market strategy 
as our  or our competitors  pricing and go to market strategies evolve  we may modify our pricing practices in the future  which could result in changes to our determination of vsoe  tpe and esp 
as a result  our future revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements could differ materially from our results in the current period 
selling prices are analyzed on an annual basis or more frequently if we experience significant changes in our selling prices 
revenue recognition policies applicable to both software and nonsoftware elements revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements arrangements with software and nonsoftware elements we also enter into multiple element arrangements that may include a combination of our various software related and nonsoftware related products and services offerings including hardware systems products  hardware systems support  new software licenses  software license updates and product support  consulting  cloud services and education 
in such arrangements  we first allocate the total arrangement consideration based on the relative selling prices of the software group of elements as a whole and to the nonsoftware elements 
we then further allocate consideration within the software group to the respective elements within that group following the guidance in asc and our policies as described above 
after the arrangement consideration has been allocated to the elements  we account for each respective element in the arrangement as described above 

table of contents other revenue recognition policies applicable to software and nonsoftware elements many of our software arrangements include consulting implementation services sold separately under consulting engagement contracts and are included as a part of our services business 
consulting revenues from these arrangements are generally accounted for separately from new software license revenues because the arrangements qualify as services transactions as defined in asc the more significant factors considered in determining whether the revenues should be accounted for separately include the nature of services ie consideration of whether the services are essential to the functionality of the licensed product  degree of risk  availability of services from other vendors  timing of payments and impact of milestones or acceptance criteria on the realizability of the software license fee 
revenues for consulting services are generally recognized as the services are performed 
if there is a significant uncertainty about the project completion or receipt of payment for the consulting services  revenues are deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved 
we estimate the proportional performance on contracts with fixed or not to exceed fees on a monthly basis utilizing hours incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated hours to complete the project 
if we do not have a sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion  revenues are recognized when we receive final acceptance from the customer that the services have been completed 
when total cost estimates exceed revenues  we accrue for the estimated losses immediately using cost estimates that are based upon an average fully burdened daily rate applicable to the consulting organization delivering the services 
the complexity of the estimation process and factors relating to the assumptions  risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the proportional performance method of accounting affects the amounts of revenues and related expenses reported in our consolidated financial statements 
a number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates  including labor rates  utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes 
our cloud services offerings are comprised of oracle cloud services and advanced customer services and are also a part of our services business 
oracle cloud services are offered as standalone arrangements or as a part of arrangements to customers buying new software licenses or hardware systems products and services 
oracle cloud services are designed to provide comprehensive software and hardware management and maintenance services for customers hosted at our oracle data center facilities  select partner data centers or physically on site at customer facilities 
advanced customer services provides support services  both onsite and remote  to oracle customers to enable increased performance and higher availability of their products and services 
depending upon the nature of the arrangement  revenues from cloud services are recognized as services are performed or ratably over the term of the service period  which is generally one year or less 
education revenues are also a part of our services business and include instructor led  media based and internet based training in the use of our software and hardware products 
education revenues are recognized as the classes or other education offerings are delivered 
if an arrangement contains multiple elements and does not qualify for separate accounting for the product and service transactions  then new software license revenues and or hardware systems products revenues  including the costs of hardware systems products  are generally recognized together with the services based on contract accounting using either the percentage of completion or completed contract method 
contract accounting is applied to any bundled software  hardware systems and services arrangements that include milestones or customer specific acceptance criteria that may affect collection of the software license or hardware systems product fees  where consulting services include significant modification or customization of the software or hardware systems product or are of a specialized nature and generally performed only by oracle  where significant consulting services are provided for in the software license contract or hardware systems product contract without additional charge or are substantially discounted  or where the software license or hardware systems product payment is tied to the performance of consulting services 
for the purposes of revenue classification of the elements that are accounted for as a single unit of accounting  we allocate revenues to software and nonsoftware elements based on a rational and consistent methodology utilizing our best estimate of fair value of such elements 
we also evaluate arrangements with governmental entities containing fiscal funding or termination for convenience provisions  when such provisions are required by law  to determine the probability of possible 
table of contents cancellation 
we consider multiple factors  including the history with the customer in similar transactions  the essential use of the software or hardware systems products and the planning  budgeting and approval processes undertaken by the governmental entity 
if we determine upon execution of these arrangements that the likelihood of cancellation is remote  we then recognize revenues once all of the criteria described above have been met 
if such a determination cannot be made  revenues are recognized upon the earlier of cash receipt or approval of the applicable funding provision by the governmental entity 
we assess whether fees are fixed or determinable at the time of sale and recognize revenues if all other revenue recognition requirements are met 
our standard payment terms are net days 
however  payment terms may vary based on the country in which the agreement is executed 
payments that are due within six months are generally deemed to be fixed or determinable based on our successful collection history on such arrangements  and thereby satisfy the required criteria for revenue recognition 
while most of our arrangements for sales within our businesses include short term payment terms  we have a standard practice of providing long term financing to creditworthy customers through our financing division 
since fiscal  when our financing division was formed  we have established a history of collection  without concessions  on these receivables with payment terms that generally extend up to five years from the contract date 
provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met  we recognize new software license revenues and hardware systems products revenues for these arrangements upon delivery  net of any payment discounts from financing transactions 
we have generally sold receivables financed through our financing division on a non recourse basis to third party financing institutions within days of the contracts dates of execution and we classify the proceeds from these sales as cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
we account for the sales of these receivables as true sales as defined in asc  transfers and servicing  as we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables 
in addition  we enter into arrangements with leasing companies for sale of our hardware systems products 
these leasing companies  in turn  lease our products to end users 
the leasing companies generally have no recourse to us in the event of default by the end user and we recognize revenue upon delivery  if all the other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
our customers include several of our suppliers and occasionally  we have purchased goods or services for our operations from these vendors at or about the same time that we have sold our products to these same companies concurrent transactions 
software license agreements or sales of hardware systems that occur within a three month time period from the date we have purchased goods or services from that same customer are reviewed for appropriate accounting treatment and disclosure 
when we acquire goods or services from a customer  we negotiate the purchase separately from any sales transaction  at terms we consider to be at arm s length  and settle the purchase in cash 
we recognize new software license revenues or hardware systems product revenues from concurrent transactions if all of our revenue recognition criteria are met and the goods and services acquired are necessary for our current operations 
business combinations in fiscal  we adopted asc  business combinations  which revised the accounting guidance that we were required to apply for our acquisitions in comparison to prior fiscal years 
the underlying principles are similar to the previous guidance and require that we recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values 
goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred and the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed 
while we use our best estimates and assumptions as a part of the purchase price allocation process to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date  our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement 
as a result  during the measurement period  which may be up to one year from the acquisition date  we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  with the corresponding offset to goodwill 
upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed  whichever comes first  any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations 

table of contents accounting for business combinations requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially at the acquisition date with respect to intangible assets  support obligations assumed  estimated restructuring liabilities and pre acquisition contingencies 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate  they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain 
examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from software license sales  hardware systems product sales  support agreements  consulting contracts  other customer contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents  expected costs to develop the in process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed  the acquired company s brand and competitive position  as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined company s product portfolio  and discount rates 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual results 
in connection with the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions  we estimate the fair value of both software license updates and product support and hardware systems support obligations assumed 
the estimated fair values of these support obligations are determined utilizing a cost build up approach 
the cost build up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin 
the estimated costs to fulfill the support obligations are based on the historical direct costs related to providing the support services and to correct any errors in the products acquired 
the sum of these costs and operating profit approximates  in theory  the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume the support obligation 
we do not include any costs associated with selling efforts or research and development or the related fulfillment margins on these costs 
profit associated with any selling efforts is excluded because the acquired entities would have concluded those selling efforts on the support contracts prior to the acquisition date 
we also do not include the estimated research and development costs in our fair value determinations  as these costs are not deemed to represent a legal obligation at the time of acquisition 
as a result  we did not recognize software license updates and product support revenues related to support contracts in the amounts of million  million and million that would have been otherwise recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in fiscal  and  respectively 
in addition  we did not recognize hardware systems support revenues related to hardware systems support contracts that would have otherwise been recorded by sun as an independent entity in the amounts of million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
historically  substantially all of our customers  including customers from acquired companies  renew their software license updates and product support contracts when the contracts are eligible for renewal and we intend to focus our efforts on renewing acquired hardware systems support contracts 
to the extent software support or hardware systems support contracts are renewed  we will recognize the revenues for the full value of the support contracts over the support periods  the substantial majority of which are one year 
in connection with a business combination  we estimate costs associated with restructuring plans committed to by our management 
restructuring costs are typically comprised of employee severance costs  costs of consolidating duplicate facilities and contract termination costs 
restructuring expenses are based upon plans that have been committed to by our management  but may be refined in subsequent periods 
we account for costs to exit or restructure certain activities of an acquired company separately from the business combination 
these costs are accounted for as one time termination and exit costs pursuant to asc  exit or disposal cost obligations 
a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized and measured at its fair value in our consolidated statement of operations in the period in which the liability is incurred 
when estimating the fair value of facility restructuring activities  assumptions are applied regarding estimated sub lease payments to be received  which can differ materially from actual results 
this may require us to revise our initial estimates which may materially affect our results of operations and financial position in the period the revision is made 

table of contents for a given acquisition  we may identify certain pre acquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and may extend our review and evaluation of these pre acquisition contingencies throughout the measurement period up to one year from the acquisition date in order to obtain sufficient information to assess whether we include these contingencies as a part of the purchase price allocation and  if so  to determine their estimated amounts 
if we determine that a pre acquisition contingency non income tax related is probable in nature and estimable as of the acquisition date  we record our best estimate for such a contingency as a part of the preliminary purchase price allocation 
we often continue to gather information for and evaluate our pre acquisition contingencies throughout the measurement period and if we make changes to the amounts recorded or if we identify additional pre acquisition contingencies during the measurement period  such amounts will be included in the purchase price allocation during the measurement period and  subsequently  in our results of operations 
in addition  uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date and we reevaluate these items quarterly with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill provided that we are within the measurement period and we continue to collect information in order to determine their estimated values 
subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the uncertain tax positions estimated value or tax related valuation allowances  whichever comes first  changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
goodwill and intangible assets impairment assessments we review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with asc  intangibles goodwill and other 
the provisions of asc require that a two step impairment test be performed on goodwill 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
our reporting units are consistent with the reportable segments identified in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit  goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates  future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
in addition  we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units 
our most recent annual goodwill impairment analysis  which was performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal  did not result in an impairment charge  nor did we record any goodwill impairment in fiscal or we make judgments about the recoverability of purchased finite lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist 
each period we evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of purchased intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization 
recoverability of finite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate 
we review indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
recoverability of indefinite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value 
if the asset is considered to be impaired  the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset 

table of contents assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible and other long lived assets are complex and subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts 
although we believe the historical assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results 
we did not recognize any intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal  or accounting for income taxes significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision 
in the ordinary course of a global business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenue sharing and cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities  the process of identifying items of revenues and expenses that qualify for preferential tax treatment  and segregation of foreign and domestic earnings and expenses to avoid double taxation 
although we believe that our estimates are reasonable  the final tax outcome of these matters could be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made 
our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no us taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be indefinitely reinvested outside the united states 
remittances of foreign earnings to the us are planned based on projected cash flow  working capital and investment needs of our foreign and domestic operations 
based on these assumptions  we estimate the amount that will be distributed to the us and provide us federal taxes on these amounts 
material changes in our estimates as to how much of our foreign earnings will be distributed to the us or tax legislation that limits or restricts the amount of undistributed foreign earnings that we consider indefinitely reinvested outside the united states could materially impact our income tax provision and effective tax rate 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in order for us to realize our deferred tax assets  we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in those jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are located 
we consider future growth  forecasted earnings  future taxable income  the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate  historical earnings  taxable income in prior years  if carryback is permitted under the law  and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination  or goodwill would be adjusted at our final determination of the valuation allowance related to an acquisition within the measurement period 
if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized  we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance as an adjustment to earnings at such time 
we calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year 
adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed and the global tax implications are known  which can materially impact our effective tax rate 
the amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal  state and foreign tax authorities  which often result in proposed assessments 
our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental 
a description of our accounting policies associated with tax related contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under business combinations above 
for those tax related contingencies that are not a part of a business combination  we account for these uncertain tax issues pursuant to asc  income taxes  which contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
although we believe we have adequately reserved for 
table of contents our uncertain tax positions  no assurance can be given with respect to the final outcome of these matters 
we adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit  judicial rulings  refinement of estimates or realization of earnings or deductions that differ from our estimates 
to the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences generally will impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which such a determination is made 
our provisions for income taxes include the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate and also include the related interest and penalties 
in addition  as a part of our accounting for business combinations  some of the purchase price is allocated to goodwill and intangible assets 
impairment charges associated with goodwill are generally not tax deductible and will result in an increased effective income tax rate in the period that any impairment is recorded 
amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible assets are generally not tax deductible pursuant to our existing tax structure  however  deferred taxes have been recorded for non deductible amortization expenses as a part of the purchase price allocation process 
we have taken into account the allocation of these identified intangibles among different taxing jurisdictions  including those with nominal or zero percent tax rates  in establishing the related deferred tax liabilities 
legal and other contingencies we are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings 
quarterly  we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure 
a description of our accounting policies associated with contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under business combinations above 
for legal and other contingencies that are not a part of a business combination  we accrue a liability for an estimated loss if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether the amount of an exposure is reasonably estimable 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based only on the best information available at the time the accruals are made 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates 
such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
stock based compensation we account for share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock awards and purchases under employee stock purchase plans in accordance with asc  compensation stock compensation  which requires that share based payments to the extent they are compensatory be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations based on their fair values 
we recognize stock based compensation expense on a straight line basis over the service period of the award  which is generally four years 
we are required to estimate the stock awards that we ultimately expect to vest and to reduce stock based compensation expense for the effects of estimated forfeitures of awards over the expense recognition period 
although we estimate the rate of future forfeitures upon historical experience  actual forfeitures in the future may differ 
to the extent our actual forfeitures are different than our estimates  we record a true up for the difference in the period that the awards vest  and such true ups could materially affect our operating results 
additionally  we also consider on a quarterly basis whether there have been any significant changes in facts and circumstances that would affect our expected forfeiture rate 
we estimate the fair values of employee stock options using a black scholes merton valuation model 
the fair value of an award is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as other assumptions including the estimated volatility of our stock price over the term of the awards and the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options 
the risk free interest rate assumption we use is based upon united states treasury interest rates appropriate for the expected life of the awards 
we use the implied volatility of our publicly traded  longest term options in order to estimate future stock price trends as we believe that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility 
in order to determine the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options  we have used historical rates of 
table of contents employee groups by seniority of job classification 
our expected dividend rate is based upon an annualized dividend yield based on the per share dividend declared by our board of directors 
the aforementioned inputs entered into the option valuation model we use to fair value our stock awards are subjective estimates and changes to these estimates will cause the fair values of our stock awards and related stock based compensation expense that we record to vary 
we record deferred tax assets for stock based awards that result in deductions on our income tax returns  based on the amount of stock based compensation recognized and the fair values attributable to the vested portion of stock awards assumed in connection with a business combination  at the statutory tax rate in the jurisdiction in which we will receive a tax deduction 
because the deferred tax assets we record are based upon the stock based compensation expenses in a particular jurisdiction  the aforementioned inputs that affect the fair values of our stock awards may also indirectly affect our income tax expense 
in addition  differences between the deferred tax assets recognized for financial reporting purposes and the actual tax deduction reported on our income tax returns are recorded in additional paid in capital 
if the tax deduction is less than the deferred tax asset  the calculated shortfall reduces our pool of excess tax benefits 
if the pool of excess tax benefits is reduced to zero  then subsequent shortfalls would increase our income tax expense 
our pool of excess tax benefits is computed in accordance with the alternative transition method pursuant to asc to the extent we change the terms of our employee stock based compensation programs  experience market volatility in the pricing of our common stock that increases the implied volatility calculation of our publicly traded  longest term options  refine different assumptions in future periods such as forfeiture rates that differ from our current estimates  or assume stock awards from acquired companies that are different in nature than our stock award arrangements  amongst other potential impacts  the stock based compensation expense that we record in future periods and the tax benefits that we realize may differ significantly from what we have recorded in previous reporting periods 
allowances for doubtful accounts we make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for the portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful 
provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices 
for those invoices not specifically reviewed  provisions are provided at differing rates  based upon the age of the receivable  the collection history associated with the geographic region that the receivable was recorded and current economic trends 
if the historical data we use to calculate the allowances for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables  additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and our future results of operations could be materially affected 
results of operations impact of acquisitions the comparability of our operating results in fiscal compared to fiscal is impacted by our acquisitions  primarily the acquisition of sun in our third quarter of fiscal and  to a lesser extent  our acquisitions of atg during the third quarter of fiscal and phase forward during the first quarter of fiscal the comparability of our operating results in fiscal compared to fiscal is impacted by our acquisitions  primarily the acquisition of sun in our third quarter of fiscal in our discussion of changes in our results of operations from fiscal compared to fiscal  and fiscal compared to fiscal  we quantify the contribution of our acquired products to the growth in new software license revenues  software license updates and product support revenues  hardware systems products revenues as applicable and hardware systems support revenues as applicable for the one year period subsequent to the acquisition date 
we also are able to quantify the total incremental expenses associated with our hardware systems products and hardware systems support operating segments 
the incremental contributions of our other acquisitions to our other businesses and operating segments revenues and expenses are not provided as they either were not separately identifiable due to the integration of these operating segments into our existing operations and or were insignificant to our results of operations during the periods presented 

table of contents we caution readers that  while pre and post acquisition comparisons as well as the quantified amounts themselves may provide indications of general trends  the acquisition information that we provide has inherent limitations for the following reasons the quantifications cannot address the substantial effects attributable to changes in business strategies  including our sales force integration efforts 
we believe that if our acquired companies had operated independently and sales forces had not been integrated  the relative mix of products sold would have been different  and although substantially all of our customers  including customers from acquired companies  renew their software license updates and product support contracts when the contracts are eligible for renewal and we strive to renew hardware systems support contracts  the amounts shown as software license updates and product support deferred revenues and hardware systems support deferred revenues in our supplemental disclosure related to certain charges presented below are not necessarily indicative of revenue improvements we will achieve upon contract renewal to the extent customers do not renew 
constant currency presentation our international operations have provided and will continue to provide a significant portion of our total revenues and expenses 
as a result  total revenues and expenses will continue to be affected by changes in the us dollar against major international currencies 
in order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations  we compare the percent change in the results from one period to another period in this annual report using constant currency disclosure 
to present this information  current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than us dollars are converted into us dollars at constant exchange rates us the rates in effect on may   which was the last day of our prior fiscal year rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods 
for example  if an entity reporting in euros had revenues of million euros from products sold on may  and may   our financial statements would reflect reported revenues of million in fiscal using as the month end average exchange rate for the period and million in fiscal using as the month end average exchange rate for the period 
the constant currency presentation would translate the fiscal results using the fiscal exchange rate and indicate  in this example  no change in revenues during the period 
in each of the tables below  we present the percent change based on actual  unrounded results in reported currency and in constant currency

excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations  the americas contributed  emea contributed and apac contributed to our total revenues growth 
excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations  the increase in total operating expenses in fiscal was due to a full year of expense contributions from sun to our fiscal operating results  including increased expenses pertaining to hardware systems products sold and related hardware systems support offerings  additional employee related expenses  and an increase in intangible asset amortization 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in restructuring expenses relating to our sun restructuring plan and certain other oracle based restructuring plans  and were also favorably affected by a million benefit related to the recovery of legal costs  and certain other insurance recoveries in fiscal on a constant currency basis  our operating margin increased during fiscal due to our total revenues growth 
our operating margin as a percentage of revenues remained flat in fiscal as our revenues and expenses grew at approximately the same rates 

table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal on a constant currency basis  total revenues increased in fiscal due to an estimated billion revenue contribution from sun  primarily in our hardware systems business  and an increase in our total software revenues resulting from growth in our new software licenses revenues and our software license updates and product support revenues

excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations  the americas contributed  emea contributed and apac contributed to our total revenues growth in fiscal excluding the unfavorable effect of currency rate fluctuations  the increase in total operating expenses in fiscal was due to additional operating expenses incurred as a result of our acquisition of sun and were of a similar nature as those noted in the fiscal compared to fiscal discussion above 
in addition  we also incurred increased restructuring expenses resulting from our sun restructuring plan and legacy oracle based restructuring plans 
these increases were partially offset by expense reductions in our legacy oracle based operations including expense reductions in our services business  reductions in bad debt expenses due to improved collections and reductions to travel expenses due to cost management initiatives 
on a constant currency basis  our operating margin increased during fiscal due to higher revenues from our software business  partially offset by post combination operating losses from sun that related to amortization of intangible assets  acquisition related and other expenses and restructuring expenses

provision for income taxes our effective tax rate in all periods is the result of the mix of income earned in various tax jurisdictions that apply a broad range of income tax rates 
the provision for income taxes differs from the tax computed at the us federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to state taxes and earnings considered as indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations

these undistributed earnings would be subject to us income tax if repatriated to the united states 
assuming a full utilization of the foreign tax credits  the potential deferred tax liability associated with these undistributed earnings would be approximately billion 
the amount of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities that we report in us dollars for a significant portion of the cash held by these subsidiaries is subject to translation adjustments caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period the offset to which is recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income in our consolidated balance sheet

we also generate significant cash from new software license sales  sales of hardware systems products and hardware systems support arrangements and  to a lesser extent  services 
our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnel related expenditures  material and manufacturing costs related to the production of our hardware systems products  taxes and leased facilities 
net cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal and primarily due to higher net income adjusted for amortization of intangible assets  stock based compensation and depreciation in each of these periods

free cash flow to supplement our statements of cash flows presented on a gaap basis  we use non gaap measures of cash flows on a trailing quarter basis to analyze cash flows generated from our operations 
we believe free cash flow is also useful as one of the bases for comparing our performance with our competitors

such purchase commitments are based on our forecasted component and manufacturing requirements and typically provide for fulfillment within agreed upon lead times and or commercially standard lead times for the particular part or product and have been included in the amount presented in the above contractual obligations table 
routine arrangements for other materials and goods that are not related to our external manufacturers and certain other suppliers and that are entered into in the ordinary course of business are not included in this amount as they are generally entered into in order to secure pricing or other negotiated terms and are difficult to quantify in a meaningful way 
as of may   we have billion of gross unrecognized tax benefits  including related interest and penalties  recorded on our consolidated balance sheet and all such obligations have been excluded from the table above due to the uncertainty as to when they might be settled

although it remains unclear as to when payments pursuant to these agreements will be made  some or all may be made in fiscal we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which the remainder of our unrecognized tax benefits will be settled or released with the relevant tax authorities  although we believe it is reasonably possible that certain of these liabilities could be settled or released during fiscal subsequent to fiscal  we agreed to acquire certain companies for amounts that are not material to our business

in addition  our european operations generally provide lower revenues in our first fiscal quarter because of the reduced economic activity in europe during the summer 
these seasonal factors are common in the high technology industry 
these factors have caused a decrease in our first quarter revenues as compared to revenues in the immediately preceding fourth quarter  which historically has been our highest revenue quarter within a particular fiscal year 
similarly  the operating income of our business is affected by seasonal factors in a consistent manner as our revenues in particular  our new software license and hardware systems products as certain expenses within our cost structure are relatively fixed in the short term 
we expect these trends to continue in fiscal our quarterly revenues  expenses and operating income were also impacted in the periods presented in the table below by our acquisition of sun during the third quarter of fiscal  which added a significant amount of revenues and expenses to our results of operations in comparison to our historical operating results 

table of contents the following tables set forth selected unaudited quarterly information for our last eight fiscal quarters 
we believe that all necessary adjustments  which consisted only of normal recurring adjustments  have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly the results of such periods when read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
the sum of the quarterly financial information may vary from the annual data due to rounding

in the second quarter of fiscal  our stockholders approved amendments to the amended and restated oracle corporation long term equity incentive plan  including an amendment to increase the number of shares available under the plan by  shares 
we historically have granted only stock options to our employees 
the restricted stock based awards included in the table presented below were assumed as a result of our acquisitions 
we recognize that options and restricted stock based awards dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number of options and restricted stock based awards granted while providing competitive compensation packages 
consistent with these dual goals  our cumulative potential dilution since june  has been a weighted average annualized rate of per year 
the potential dilution percentage is calculated as the average annualized new options or restricted stock based awards granted and assumed  net of options and restricted stock based awards forfeited by employees leaving the company  divided by the weighted average outstanding shares during the calculation period 
this maximum potential dilution will only result if all options are exercised and restricted stock based awards vest 
some of the outstanding options  which generally have a year exercise period  have exercise prices higher than the current market price of our common stock 
at may   of our outstanding stock options had exercise prices in excess of the current market price 
in recent years  our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect of our stock based compensation program  however  we may reduce the level of our stock repurchases in the future as we may use our available cash for acquisitions  to pay dividends  to repay or repurchase indebtedness or for other purposes 
at may   the maximum potential dilution from all outstanding and unexercised stock option and restricted stock based awards  regardless of when granted and regardless of whether vested or unvested and including options where the strike price is higher than the current market price  was

recent accounting pronouncements for information with respect to recent accounting pronouncements and the impact of these pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and interest income risk our bank deposits and money market investments are generally held with a number of large  diverse financial institutions worldwide which we believe mitigates certain risks 
in addition  we purchase high quality debt security investments  substantially all with relatively short maturities see a description of our debt securities held in notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements and liquidity and capital resources above 
therefore  interest rate movements generally do not materially affect the valuation of our debt security investments 
substantially all of our marketable securities are designated as available for sale 
we generally do not use our investments for trading purposes 

table of contents changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest income that is generated from our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
for fiscal  total interest income was million with our investments yielding an average on a worldwide basis 
the table below presents the fair value of our cash  cash equivalent and marketable securities and the related weighted average interest rates for our investment portfolio at may  and may  dollars in millions fair value weighted average interest rate fair value weighted average interest rate cash and cash equivalents marketable securities total cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities interest expense risk our total borrowings were billion as of may   primarily all of which were fixed rate borrowings 
future changes in interest rates and resulting changes in estimated fair values of our borrowings other than our senior notes due july notes and short term borrowings pursuant to our credit agreements would not impact the interest expense we recognize in our consolidated statements of operations 
we have entered into certain fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements to manage the interest rate and related fair value of our notes so that the interest payable on the notes effectively became variable based on libor 
we do not use these interest rate swap arrangements or our fixed rate borrowings for trading purposes 
we have designated these swap agreements as qualifying instruments and are accounting for them as fair value hedges pursuant to asc  derivatives and hedging 
these transactions are characterized as fair value hedges for financial accounting purposes because they protect us against changes in the fair values of our notes due to interest rate movements 
the changes in fair values of these interest rate swap agreements will be recognized as interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations with the corresponding amounts included in other assets or other non current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
the amount of net gain loss attributable to the risk being hedged is recognized as interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations with the corresponding amount included in notes payable and other non current borrowings 
the periodic interest settlements  which occur at the same intervals as the notes  are recorded as interest expense 
by entering into these interest rate swap arrangements  we have assumed risks associated with variable interest rates based upon libor 
our notes had an effective interest rate of as of may   after considering the effects of the aforementioned interest rate swap arrangements 
changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest expense that we recognize in our statements of operations 
an interest rate risk sensitivity analysis is used to measure interest rate risk by computing estimated changes in cash flows as a result of assumed changes in market interest rates 
as of may   if libor based interest rates increased by basis points  the change would increase our interest expense annually by approximately million as it relates to our fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements 
foreign currency risk foreign currency transaction risk we transact business in various foreign currencies and are subject to risks associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures 
we have a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset these risks 
we may suspend this program from time to time and did so during the fourth quarter of fiscal until resuming the program in the second quarter of fiscal we enter into foreign currency forward contracts so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts in order to mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign 
table of contents currency transactions 
our foreign currency exposures typically arise from intercompany sublicense fees and other intercompany transactions that are expected to be cash settled in the near term 
our foreign currency forward contracts are generally short term in duration 
we neither use these foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes nor do we designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to asc accordingly  we record the fair values of these contracts as of the end of our reporting period to our consolidated balance sheet with changes in fair values recorded to our consolidated statement of operations 
the balance sheet classification for the fair values of these forward contracts is prepaid expenses and other current assets for unrealized gains and other current liabilities for unrealized losses 
the statement of operations classification of gains or losses upon changes in fair values or cash settlement of these forward contracts is non operating income expense  net 
although we have resumed our foreign currency forward contract program  we expect that we will continue to realize gains or losses with respect to our foreign currency exposures  net of gains or losses from our foreign currency forward contracts 
our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency exposures will generally depend on the size and type of cross currency transactions that we enter into  the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates  the net realized gain or loss on our foreign currency forward contracts and other factors 
as of may   the notional amounts of the forward contracts we held to purchase us dollars in exchange for other major international currencies were billion and the notional amounts of forward contracts we held to sell us dollars in exchange for other major international currencies were billion 
the net unrealized gains of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts were nominal at may  as of may   we had a nominal amount of foreign currency forward contracts outstanding 
net foreign exchange transaction gains losses included in non operating income expense  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
included in the net foreign exchange transaction losses for fiscal were foreign currency losses relating to our venezuelan subsidiary s operations  which are more thoroughly described under non operating income expense  net in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations above 
as a large portion of our consolidated operations are international  we could experience additional foreign currency volatility in the future  the amounts and timing of which may vary 
foreign currency translation risk fluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets and liabilities that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into us dollars 
in particular  the amount of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities that we report in us dollars for a significant portion of the cash held by these subsidiaries is subject to translation variance caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period the offset to which is recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheet 
periodically  we may hedge net assets of certain international subsidiaries from foreign currency exposure 

table of contents as the us dollar fluctuated against certain international currencies as of the end of fiscal  the amount of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities that we reported in us dollars for these subsidiaries as of may  increased relative to what we would have reported using a constant currency rate as of may  as reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows  the estimated effect of exchange rate changes on our reported cash and cash equivalents balances in us dollars for fiscal  and was an increase decrease of million  million and million  respectively 
the following table includes the us dollar equivalent of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities denominated in certain major foreign currencies as of may  in millions us dollar equivalent at may  euro chinese renminbi indian rupee japanese yen south african rand british pound other foreign currencies total cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities denominated in foreign currencies if overall foreign currency exchange rates in comparison to the us dollar uniformly weakened by  the amount of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities we would report in us dollars would decrease by approximately million  assuming constant foreign currency cash  cash equivalent and marketable securities balances
