the following discussion contains forward looking statements  which involve risks  uncertainties  and assumptions 
our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those set forth in part i item a above under the caption risk factors 
see cautionary note regarding forward looking statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
ongoing business activities we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of innovative antibody based therapies for the treatment of cancer 
our product development pipeline includes novel antibodies generated with our proprietary bite antibody platform  as well as conventional monoclonal antibodies 
bite antibodies represent a new class of antibodies that activate the t cells of a patient s immune system to eliminate cancer cells 
t cells are considered the most powerful killer cells of the human immune system 
seven of our antibodies are currently in clinical trials  while the remainder of our product pipeline is in preclinical development 
our lead product candidate is the bite antibody blinatumomab  also known as mt blinatumomab targets the human protein molecule cd  which is expressed on the surface of tumor cells of certain cancers 
in a phase clinical trial evaluating blinatumomab as a treatment for patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia  or all  of patients experienced elimination of cancerous cells in their bone marrow  which was the primary endpoint of the trial 
we have initiated a pivotal  multi center  single arm study referred to as blast blinatumomab adult all mrd study of t cell engagement which  if successful  has the potential to support the filing of a marketing approval application in europe 
we have also initiated a phase trial in adult patients with relapsed or refractory b precursor all and are evaluating blinatumomab in an ongoing phase clinical trial for the treatment of patients with non hodgkin s lymphoma  or nhl 
we are evaluating a second bite antibody  mt  in a phase clinical trial for the treatment of patients with advanced solid tumors 
mt targets the epithelial cell adhesion molecule  or epcam  which is overexpressed in many solid tumors 
our collaboration partner medimmune  llc has initiated a phase clinical trial of mt  a bite antibody targeting carcinoembryonic antigen  or cea  in patients with advanced solid tumors 
additional bite antibodies are at different stages of lead candidate selection and preclinical development 
in addition to the collaboration with medimmune  we have also entered into collaboration agreements with bayer schering pharma and sanofi aventis for the development of bite antibodies targeting other solid tumor targets  and with boehringer ingelheim for the development of bite antibodies for the treatment of multiple myeloma 
our conventional monoclonal antibody adecatumumab  also known as mt  binds to epcam and is the subject of a collaboration with merck serono 
in august  we discontinued enrollment in a phase trial of adecatumumab in patients with resected liver metastases from colorectal cancer  due to a change in the standard of care in this disease setting which resulted in slower recruitment than was planned 
mt  a human antibody neutralizing the activity of granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor  or gm csf  which has potential applications in the treatment of various inflammatory and autoimmune diseases  such as rheumatoid arthritis  psoriasis  or multiple sclerosis  is under development in a phase clinical trial being conducted by our collaboration partner nycomed 
our monoclonal antibody mt  also known as trc  is licensed to tracon pharmaceuticals  inc and has completed a phase clinical trial for the treatment of patients with cancer 
finally  our conventional antibody mt  licensed to morphotek  inc  is the subject of an ongoing phase clinical trial in patients with advanced melanoma 
to date  we have incurred significant research and development expenses and have not achieved any revenues from sales of our product candidates 
each of our programs will require a number of years and significant costs to advance through development 
typically  it takes many years from the initial identification of a lead antibody target to the completion of preclinical and clinical trials  before applying for marketing approval from the us food and drug administration  or fda  or the european medicines agency  or ema  or equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries and regions 
the risk that a program has to be terminated  
table of contents in part or in full  for safety reasons or lack of adequate efficacy is very high 
in particular  we cannot predict which  if any  product candidates can be successfully developed and for which marketing approval may be obtained  or the time and cost to complete development and receive marketing approvals 
as we obtain results from preclinical studies or clinical trials  we may elect to discontinue the development of one or more product candidates for safety  efficacy or commercial reasons 
we may also elect to discontinue or delay development of one or more product candidates in order to focus our resources on more promising product candidates 
our business strategy includes entering into collaborative agreements with third parties for the development and commercialization of certain of our product candidates 
depending on the structure of such collaborative agreements  a third party may be granted control over the clinical trial process  manufacturing process or other key development process  for one of our product candidates 
in such a situation  the third party  rather than us  may in fact control development and commercialization decisions for the respective product candidate 
consistent with our business model  we may enter into additional collaboration agreements in the future 
we cannot predict the terms of such agreements or their potential impact on our capital requirements 
our inability to complete our research and development projects in a timely manner  or our failure to enter into new collaborative agreements  when appropriate  could significantly increase our capital requirements and affect our liquidity 
research and development through december   our research and development expenses consisted of costs associated with the clinical development of blinatumomab  adecatumumab and mt  as well as development costs incurred for mt and mt  and research conducted with respect to our preclinical bite antibodies and the bite antibody platform generally 
this includes costs associated with clinical trials and manufacturing processes  quality systems and analytical development  compensation and other personnel expenses  supplies and materials  consultant fees and related contract research  facility costs  license fees and depreciation 
we charge all research and development expenses to operations as incurred 
we expect to incur substantial additional research and development expenses that may increase from historical levels as we further develop our product candidates into more advanced stages of clinical development and increase our preclinical development for certain of our conventional and bite antibodies 
our strategic collaborations and license agreements generally provide for our research  development and commercialization programs to be partly or wholly funded by our collaborators and provide us with the opportunity to receive additional payments if specified development or commercialization milestones are achieved  as well as royalty payments upon the successful commercialization of any products based upon our collaborations 
we also may retain co promotion rights in certain of our agreements 
through march  we developed blinatumomab in collaboration with medimmune under an agreement signed in  which we refer to in this report as the agreement 
under the agreement  medimmune reimbursed a portion of our clinical development costs in our european clinical trials 
in november  we entered into a termination agreement  which we refer to as the agreement  under which we acquired medimmune s remaining option right to commercialize blinatumomab in north america 
the agreement terminates the agreement  under which medimmune had been granted the right to develop and commercialize blinatumomab and other bite antibodies binding to antigens relevant for hematological cancers in north america 
as a result of the agreement  we now control the rights to develop and commercialize blinatumomab in all territories  as well as any other bite antibodies binding to antigens relevant for hematological cancers that had been licensed to medimmune under the agreement 
under the terms of the agreement  medimmune sold us the remaining stock of blinatumomab clinical trial material and transferred the manufacturing process for this product candidate to our contract manufacturers 
in return  we made fixed payments totaling million  the last of which was made in january medimmune is eligible to receive additional payments of up to million from us based upon the achievement of specified strategic and regulatory milestone events relating to blinatumomab in north america and a low single digit royalty based on net sales of blinatumomab in north america 
a second agreement with medimmune under which we are collaborating on the development of mt provides for us to receive potential future milestone payments and royalty payments based on future sales of mt the potential milestone payments are subject to the successful completion of clinical development 
table of contents and obtaining marketing approval in one or more national markets 
under this agreement  we also retain exclusive rights to commercialize mt in europe 
in may  we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with boehringer ingelheim international gmbh  or bi  under which we will collaborate on the development and commercialization of a bite antibody for the treatment of multiple myeloma 
under the terms of the agreement  we are responsible for the generation of the bite antibody  and the parties will collaborate on pre clinical development activities 
boehringer ingelheim is responsible for the manufacturing and the worldwide clinical development of the product 
we will co promote the product in the united states  and bi will be responsible for the commercialization of the product outside the united states 
bi will bear all costs of the development and commercialization of the product  except that we will bear the costs related to our own pre clinical activities up to a specified amount and the cost of our own us sales force 
we received an upfront cash payment of million approximately million using the exchange rate on the date of the agreement and are eligible to receive up to million approximately million using the exchange rate on the date of the agreement upon the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones 
if a bite antibody that is the subject of the collaboration is approved for marketing  we will be eligible to receive tiered low double digit royalties on net sales of the product outside the united states and sales participation payment based on a percentage of us net sales ranging from the mid twenties to the low thirties 
in october  we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with sanofi aventis under we are collaborating on the development of a new bite antibody targeting solid tumors 
under the terms of the agreement  we are responsible for generating and developing the bite antibody through the completion of phase clinical trials  at which point sanofi aventis will assume full control of the development and commercialization of the product candidate on a worldwide basis 
we received an upfront payment of million  or million as of the date of the agreement  and are eligible to receive payments upon the achievement of development milestones of up to million  or million using the exchange rate as of the date of the agreement  and sales milestones of up to million  or million using the exchange rate as of the date of the agreement  and up to a low double digit royalty on worldwide net sales of the product 
in addition  sanofi aventis will bear the cost of development activities and will reimburse us for our expenses incurred in connection with the development program 
a portion of the upfront payment in the amount of million  or million as of the date of the agreement  is related to the payment of ftes allocated by us to the performance of the development program 
in january  we entered into an option  collaboration and license agreement with bayer schering pharma ag under which we granted bayer schering pharma an exclusive option to obtain a license to one of our preclinical bite antibodies against an undisclosed oncology target for an upfront fee of million  or approximately million using the exchange rate as of the date of the agreement 
in december  bayer schering pharma exercised the option and paid us the exercise fee of million  or approximately million using the exchange rate as of the date of the agreement  in january we have now initiated a collaboration on the development of the bite antibody through the completion of phase clinical trials  at which point bayer schering pharma will assume full control of the further development and commercialization of the bite antibody 
in addition to the payment of the initial option fee and the option exercise fee  we will be eligible to receive total development and sales milestone payments of million  or approximately million using the exchange rate as of the date of the agreement  and up to double digit royalties based on tiered net sales of the product to be developed under the agreement 
in addition  bayer schering pharma will reimburse us for our research and development expenses incurred in connection with the development program 
to date  we have recognized approximately million under this agreement as reimbursement of our r d expenses  as well as million in milestone payments 
under our collaboration agreement with merck serono  we have received million in upfront and milestone payments from merck serono to date  not including payments for costs and expenses incurred in connection with the development of adecatumumab 
the agreement provides for potential future clinical development milestone payments of up to an additional million 
we have all decision making authority and operational responsibility for the clinical trials of adecatumumab that we conduct 
merck serono will bear the development expenses associated with the collaboration in accordance with the agreed upon budget and a specified maximum 
this maximum amount has been reached and micromet is now responsible for further 
table of contents expenses associated with the wind down of the phase clinical trial of adecatumumab in patients with resected liver metastases from colorectal cancer 
we expect no further reimbursement revenues pending our and merck serono s determination of the next steps for the development of this product candidate 
we intend to pursue additional collaborations to provide resources for further development of our product candidates and may grant technology access licenses 
however  we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty whether we will be able to enter into collaborative agreements  and if we do  on what terms we might do so 
we are unable to estimate with any certainty the costs we will incur in the continued development of our product candidates 
however  we expect our research and development costs associated with these product candidates to increase as we continue to develop new indications and advance these product candidates through preclinical and clinical trials 
clinical development timelines  the likelihood of success and total costs vary widely 
we anticipate that we will make determinations as to which research and development projects to pursue and how much funding to direct to each project on an ongoing basis in response to the scientific and clinical success of each product candidate as well as relevant commercial factors 
the costs and timing for developing and obtaining regulatory approvals of our product candidates vary significantly for each product candidate and are difficult to estimate 
the expenditure of substantial resources will be required for the lengthy process of clinical development and obtaining regulatory approvals as well as to comply with applicable regulations 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals could cause our research and development expenditures to increase and  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates our financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
such statements require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k  we believe the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements which require significant estimates and judgments are as follows revenue recognition our revenues generally consist of licensing fees  milestone payments  royalties and fees for research services earned from license agreements or from research and development collaboration agreements 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the sec s staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition  upon the satisfaction of the following four criteria persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenues under collaborative research agreements as we perform the services specified in the related agreement  or as we incur expenses that are passed through to the collaborator 
milestone payments are received upon the achievement of goals predetermined under the collaboration agreements 
for milestones that are deemed substantive  we recognize the contingent revenue once the milestone has been reached and any required customer acceptance has been obtained 
milestones are considered substantive if all the following criteria are met the milestone payment is non refundable and relates solely to past performance  achievement of the milestone was not reasonably assured at the inception of the arrangement  substantive effort is involved to achieve the milestone  and the amount of the milestone payment appears reasonable in relation to the effort expended  other milestones in the arrangement and the related risk of achieving the milestone 
fees for research and development services performed under an agreement are generally stated at a yearly fixed fee per research scientist  and are recognized as revenues as the services are provided 
we record any amounts received in advance of services performed as deferred revenue and recognize them as revenues if and when earned 
under certain license agreements  we may receive initial license fees and annual renewal fees which are recognized as revenue when the sab no 
criteria have been satisfied unless we have further 
table of contents obligations associated with the license granted 
we recognize revenue from payments received at the time of entering into an agreement on a straight line basis over the term of our obligations under the agreement 
we are entitled to receive royalty payments on the sale of products under license and collaboration agreements 
royalties are based upon the volume of products sold and are recognized as revenue upon notification of sales from the customer 
through december   we have not received or recognized any royalty payments 
for arrangements that include multiple deliverables  we identify separate units of accounting based on the consensus reached on fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
asc topic provides that revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met 
the consideration for the arrangement is allocated to the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values 
applicable revenue recognition criteria are considered separately for each unit of accounting 
we recognize revenue on development and collaboration agreements  including upfront payments  where they are considered combined units of accounting  over the expected life of the development period and collaboration agreement on a straight line basis 
goodwill we review goodwill for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate a reduction in the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill has been assigned 
a reporting unit is an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component 
we have determined that we have only one reporting unit  the development of biopharmaceutical products 
conditions that would necessitate a goodwill impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  an adverse action or assessment by a regulatory authority  unanticipated competition  a loss of key personnel  or the presence of other indicators that would indicate a reduction in the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill has been assigned 
asc topic  goodwill and other intangible assets  prescribes a two step process for impairment testing of goodwill 
the first step of the impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill has been assigned to its carrying amount  including the goodwill 
since we have determined that we have only one reporting unit  we calculate fair value as our total market capitalization adjusted for a control premium 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  the second step of the impairment test is performed in order to measure the impairment loss 
as a result of the merger between micromet ag and cancervax in  we recorded million of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet 
on october   we performed our annual goodwill impairment assessment in accordance with asc topic and determined that the carrying amount of this goodwill was still recoverable 
we cannot assure you that our future annual assessment of goodwill recoverability will not result in a material impairment charge 
patents our patent portfolio consists primarily of internally developed patents covering our bite antibody platform and the composition of our bite antibody product candidates and conventional antibodies 
the costs of generating our internally developed patent portfolio have been expensed as incurred 
we also acquired patents in covering single chain antibody technology 
these purchased patents are being amortized over their estimated useful lives through using the straight line method 
these patents are utilized in revenue producing activities through license agreements 
evidence from recent licensing transactions indicated that our future licensing fees derived from these purchased patents will be lower than previously expected 
we deemed these events in connection with lower expectations of future licensing fees to be an indication of potential impairment 
we periodically assessed whether the carrying value of the purchased patents was recoverable 
we evaluated whether the carrying value of the patents would be recoverable by comparing their carrying value to the undiscounted cash flows generated from these patents 
the carrying value was in excess of the undiscounted cash flows  therefore  we estimated the fair value of the patents to determine the amount of impairment 
we estimated the fair value of the patents using the income approach discounted cash flows 

table of contents based on the fair value  we recognized non cash patent impairment charges of approximately million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the impairment charges were recorded within research and development expenses on the statement of operations 
key inputs utilized in the determination of this non recurring fair value measurement related to our estimates of cash flows for the remaining patent life and the discount rate factor 
the determination of the discount rate was based upon the risk free rate  adjusted by a risk premium 
clinical trial expenses clinical trial expenses include expenses associated with clinical research organizations  or cros 
in some cases  we may not receive invoices from cros until several months after the services were rendered 
we accrue the cost of services based on our estimates of the management  monitoring  and project management costs 
we maintain regular communication with our cros to confirm the reasonableness of our estimates 
differences between actual clinical trial expenses and estimated clinical trial expenses recorded have not been material and adjustments are recorded in the period they become known 
stock based compensation we estimate the fair value of share based compensation awards on the grant date in accordance with asc topic  share based payment  using the black scholes option pricing model 
option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  and changes in the assumptions used can materially affect the grant date fair value of an award 
these assumptions include the risk free rate of interest  expected dividend yield  expected volatility  and the expected life of the award 
the risk free rate of interest is based on the us treasury rates appropriate for the expected term of the award 
expected dividend yield is projected at  as we have not paid any dividends on our common stock since our inception and we do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
expected volatility is based on our historical volatility of our common stock 
the expected term of options granted is derived from the average midpoint between vesting and the contractual term 
asc topic also requires that forfeitures be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the pre vesting forfeiture rate for the year ended december  was based on historical forfeiture experience for similar levels of employees to whom the options were granted 
performance based stock options vest upon the attainment of specific performance targets 
the measurement date of stock options containing performance based vesting is the date the stock option grant is authorized and the specific performance goals are communicated 
compensation expense is recognized based on the probability that the performance criteria will be met 
the recognition of compensation expense associated with performance based vesting requires judgment in assessing the probability of meeting the performance goals  as well as defined criteria for assessing achievement of the performance related goals 
the continued assessment of probability may result in additional expense recognition or expense reversal depending on the level of achievement of the performance goals 
common stock warrants liability in accordance with asc topic  accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock  we classify warrants as liabilities when the potential for a net cash settlement to the holders of the warrants exists  even if remote 
asc topic also requires that the warrants be revalued at the end of each reporting period as our warrants are considered to be derivative instruments 
we adjust the instruments to their current fair value using the black scholes option pricing model formula at each reporting period end  with any resulting change in value recorded in the statement of operations 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december   and revenues 
collaborative research and development revenue consists of reimbursements for full time equivalents and pass through expenses we incur under each collaborative agreement as described in detail below 
license and other revenue consists primarily of revenues from licenses of patents relating to single chain antibody technology  for which we serve as the exclusive marketing partner under a marketing agreement with enzon pharmaceuticals  inc

years ended december  research and development revenue by collaborator bayer schering nycomed sanofi aventis merck serono medimmune boehringer ingelheim tracon other total collaborative research and development revenue license and other revenue total revenues bayer schering pharma 
we granted an option to bayer schering pharma in january regarding the development of a new bite antibody for an option fee of approximately million 
this option fee was fully recognized during and represented the full amount of revenue under this collaboration in bayer schering pharma exercised the option in december for which we received an exercise fee of approximately million in january this fee  which resulted in million of revenue during  is being recognized on a straight line basis over months  the period during which we expect to participate on the joint steering committee under our collaboration agreement with bayer schering pharma 
in addition  we recognized million in revenue during as payment of our research and development expenses and million in development milestones 
while the amortization of the license fee into revenue will remain constant on an annual basis  we expect an overall decrease in revenues under this agreement for as compared to as we do not expect to achieve any development milestones in for which we would receive payments 
nycomed 
collaborative research and development revenue from nycomed reflects nycomed s full cost responsibility for the mt product development program 
the nycomed revenue represents the reimbursement of our preclinical development activities  including payments for full time equivalents  as well as million in revenue representing the annual amortized portion of the million upfront payment that we received from nycomed in this upfront payment is being recognized on a straight line basis over a year period ending in the decrease in overall nycomed revenue of million for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in  was primarily due to a million milestone payment received during  no milestones were received in the decrease in overall nycomed revenue of million for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in  was due primarily to our lower level of activity during  as nycomed assumed primary responsibility for the development of mt and initiated a phase clinical trial of this product candidate during this decrease was partially offset by the million milestone payment received during we expect our nycomed revenue to decline further in as nycomed continues to perform later stage development work 
sanofi aventis 
we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with sanofi aventis in the fourth quarter of upon execution of the agreement  we received an upfront license fee of approximately million and upfront research and development expenses of million 
the upfront license fee is being recognized into revenue on a straight line basis over months  the period during which we expect to participate on the joint steering committee under the collaboration agreement 
the upfront research and development payment is being recognized as revenues as the services are performed 
we also receive payment for our research and development expenses under the program 
the increase in revenues of million over reflects that the collaboration was only in place for the last two months of during  we recorded million in development revenues under this collaboration and million representing the annual amortized portion of the upfront payment 
while the amortized portion of the upfront payment will remain the same  we expect our overall revenues under this agreement to increase in as we continue development 

table of contents merck serono 
collaborative research and development revenues from merck serono reflect merck serono s responsibility for the costs for the development of the adecatumumab program 
revenues during were consistent with those recognized during and during  the development expenses reimbursable by merck serono for the current stage of development reached a pre negotiated maximum 
accordingly  we do not expect to receive any further reimbursement of expenses under this program 
medimmune 
collaborative research and development revenue from medimmune represents payments for our costs incurred in the development of blinatumomab and mt medimmune ended its participation in the development of blinatumomab in march  and we terminated our collaboration with medimmune for the development of blinatumomab in the fourth quarter of the decrease in revenue of million for the year ended december  as compared to is due to the lower activity by us under this agreement  the decrease was partially offset by a million milestone payment received in the decrease of million for the year ended december   as compared to  is primarily due to the termination of the blinatumomab collaboration  which accounted for million of the decrease 
the remainder of the decrease between and was due to lower levels of activity under the mt agreement 
we expect collaborative revenue from medimmune for mt to decrease compared to due to our limited development obligations while medimmune conducts the ongoing phase clinical trial with mt boehringer ingelheim 
research and development revenues from boehringer ingelheim represent payment for our development costs and a portion of the upfront payment of million  or million using the exchange rate as of the payment date  that is being recognized over a year period ending in we expect revenues to increase in under this agreement as the collaboration progresses 
tracon 
collaborative research and development revenue from tracon reflects tracon s full responsibility for the costs of the mt product development program 
revenue under this agreement consists of expense payments for development services and revenue from an upfront payment of million received from tracon in that is being recognized on a straight line basis over a year period ending in as tracon is responsible for the development of the product candidate  including its own costs  we will not receive any material revenue from this agreement until such time  if any  that development milestones are achieved 
research and development expenses 
research and development expense consists of costs incurred to discover and develop product candidates 
these expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel  outside service costs including production of clinical material  fees for services in the context of clinical trials  medicinal chemistry  consulting and sponsored research collaborations  and occupancy and depreciation charges 
we incur process development expenses mainly for production of gmp grade clinical trial material  as well as fermentation  purification and formulation development 
preclinical development expenses cover pharmacological in vitro and in vivo experiments as well as development of analytical testing procedures 
except for payments made in advance of services rendered  we expense research and development costs as incurred 
research and development expense was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease of million for the year ended december  as compared to results from some large non recurring expenses recorded in  including a million expense related to the termination of our blinatumomab collaboration with medimmune  a million expense for the settlement of our arbitration with curis  inc and a million patent impairment charge 
we also recorded lower adecatumumab related development expenses during  million less than in overall  the decreased expenses for were partially offset by increases in blinatumomab related expenses of million  primarily for manufacturing and clinical activities  expense increases of million for our mt program and million for our mt program  also primarily for manufacturing  increases to salary related expenses of million  an increase to our mtr program of million  and an increase in stock based compensation expense of million 

table of contents the increase of million for the year ended december  over was partially the result of million in expenses incurred in connection with the termination of our blinatumomab collaboration  consisting of our million initial payment to medimmune  our purchase of the clinical trial inventory of blinatumomab for million  a cost of million to transfer the blinatumomab manufacturing process to our contract manufacturer and regulatory related expenses of million 
for  we also accrued million of expense for the settlement of our arbitration with curis  inc  which occurred in february  as well as a patent impairment charge of million relating to the single chain antibody patents purchased from curis in we also incurred a million increase in stock based compensation for over  which was primarily the result of accelerated vesting of stock options from the separation of our chief medical officer  as well as the vesting of performance based stock options during partially offsetting these increases over was a reduction in mt expenses of million during due to the shift in program responsibilities to nycomed for the later stage development work  which also had the effect of reducing collaborative revenue from this program during since  we have tracked our external research and development expenses by major project candidate development program  such as for blinatumomab  mt  adecatumumab and mt  or we allocate the expenses to our bite antibody platform generally 
we do not allocate salary and overhead costs or stock based compensation expense to specific research and development projects or product candidates

general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and related costs for personnel in executive  finance  accounting  legal  information technology  corporate communications and human resource functions 
other costs include allocated facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expense  insurance  and professional fees for legal and audit services 
general and administrative expense was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase of million for the year ended december  over resulted from an increase in salaries and benefits of million for increased headcount as we expanded key functions  an increase in incentive compensation costs of million  stock based compensation expense increases of million  a charge of million to adjust our lease exit accrual and an increase of million in commercial expenses 
the increase of million for the year ended december  over resulted from increased stock based compensation charges of million for vesting of performance based stock option grants  overall increases of million in salaries  million for investor relations expenses and million for professional fees 
interest income and expense 
interest income decreased from million in to million in and remained at million in the decrease for the year ended december  as compared to was the result of lower average interest rates on invested cash balances 
interest expense was 
table of contents million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  and primarily represents interest on capital leases 
change in fair value of common stock warrants liability 
we have issued warrants to purchase our common stock that require us  or any successor entity  to purchase each unexercised warrant for a cash amount equal to its fair value computed using the black scholes option pricing model with prescribed guidelines in any of the following circumstances we are merged or consolidated with or into another company  we sell all or substantially all of our assets in one or a series of related transactions  any tender offer or exchange offer is completed pursuant to which holders of our common stock are permitted to tender or exchange their shares for other securities  cash or property  or we effect any reclassification of our common stock or any compulsory share exchange pursuant to which the common stock is effectively converted into or exchanged for other securities  cash or property 
as a consequence of these provisions  the warrants are classified as a liability on our balance sheet  and changes in our stock price cause the fair value of the warrants to change each reporting period  with these changes being reflected in the statement of operations 
increases in our stock price cause the warrant liability to increase  and this increase is charged to expense  while decreases in our stock price cause the liability to decrease  which is recorded as a reduction to other income 
our stock price increased from on december  to on december   to on december   and to on december  these increases resulted in incremental expenses of million  million and million for the years ending december   and  respectively 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net includes foreign currency transaction gains and losses and miscellaneous other items 
the increase in income of million for the period ending december  over and the decrease in other income of million during as compared to resulted in each case from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
liquidity and capital resources summary of cash flows we had cash and cash equivalents and available for sale investments of million and million as of december  and  respectively

net cash used in operating activities was million for  million for  and million for in each case the majority of the cash used was to fund our ongoing research and development efforts  resulting in net losses of million  million and million  respectively  during these years 
our net losses for these years were adjusted by million  million and million  respectively  of net non cash expenses  including the changes in fair value of warrant liability described above 
working capital changes resulted in net cash outflows of million during the year ended december  and net cash inflows of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
as described elsewhere in this report  we received upfront cash payments of million from bayer schering pharma and million from boehringer ingelheim during we also received milestone payments totaling million from bayer schering pharma and a million milestone payment from medimmune during this compares with upfront cash payments of million received from sanofi aventis during  and a million milestone payment received from nycomed during each of these upfront payments is being recognized as revenue over an extended period 
other working capital changes in include net increase in accounts receivable of million and net increases to accounts payable and accrued expenses of million 
for  other significant working capital changes included a net decrease of million in accounts receivable from collections and a net increase of million in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
at the end of  we had accrued approximately million to be paid to medimmune in connection with the termination of our blinatumomab collaboration 
we had also accrued million in connection with our settlement with curis  inc  which was resolved and paid in february for  significant working capital changes included net cash inflows from collections of accounts receivable of million and net outflows from a decrease in prepaid expenses of million 

table of contents net cash used in investing activities of million for was the result of the net purchase of investments of million and equipment purchases of million for laboratory equipment and computers 
net cash used in investing activities was million in and million in net cash provided by financing activities was million for which resulted from two public offerings of common stock that raised a total of million  and from option and warrant exercises for which we received million and million  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for resulting from net proceeds from our public offering and the ceff with kingsbridge 
during  we also received million from the exercise of stock options and used million to repay in full our debt under a promissory note to medimmune 
during  the net cash provided by financing activities of million included a private placement of common stock and warrants that resulted in net proceeds of approximately million and stock option and warrant exercises of million  offset by payments of million for the repayment of our silent partnership debt 
sources and uses of cash we have funded our recent operations through public offerings and private placements of common stock and associated warrants  equity draws under the ceff with kingsbridge  research contribution revenues from our collaborations with pharmaceutical companies and licensing and milestone payments related to our product candidate partnering activities 
we expect that operating losses and negative cash flows from operations will continue for at least the next several years 
if appropriate  we may raise substantial funds through the sale of our common stock or debt securities or through establishing additional strategic collaboration agreements 
we do not know whether additional financing will be available when needed  or whether it will be available on favorable terms  or at all 
based on our capital resources as of the date of this report  we believe that we have adequate resources to fund our operations into  without considering any potential future milestone payments that we may receive under our current or any new collaborations we may enter into in the future  any future capital raising transactions or any additional draw downs from our ceff with kingsbridge  which is scheduled to expire in december if we are unable to raise additional funds when needed  we may not be able to continue development of our product candidates or we could be required to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our development programs and other operations 
if we were to raise additional funds through the issuance of common stock  it could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders 
if we were to raise additional funds through additional debt financing  the terms of the debt may involve significant cash payment obligations  as well as covenants and financial ratios that could restrict our ability to operate our business 
having insufficient funds could require us to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our research or development programs or to relinquish some or all of our rights to our product candidates at an earlier stage of development or on less favorable terms than we would otherwise choose 
if we raise funds through corporate collaborations or licensing arrangements  we may be required to relinquish  on terms that are not favorable to us  rights to some of our technologies or product candidates that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves 
failure to obtain adequate financing may also adversely affect our operating results or our ability to operate as a going concern 
our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous forward looking factors that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors  including the factors discussed in risk factors in this report 
in light of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our product candidates  we are unable to estimate the amount and timing of our capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our current and anticipated clinical trials 
our future funding requirements will depend on many factors  including the number  scope  rate of progress  results and costs of our preclinical studies  clinical trials and other research and development activities  the terms and timing of any corporate collaborations that we may establish  and the success of these collaborations  the cost  timing and outcomes of regulatory approvals  the number and characteristics of product candidates that we pursue  
table of contents the cost and timing of establishing manufacturing  marketing and sales  and distribution capabilities  the cost of establishing clinical and commercial supplies of our product candidates  the cost of preparing  filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the cost of preparing for  defending against and the ultimate resolution of litigation or other claims brought against us  and the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses  products or technologies  although we currently have no commitments or agreements relating to any of these types of transactions 
committed equity financing facility 
on december   we entered into the ceff with kingsbridge pursuant to which kingsbridge committed to purchase  subject to certain conditions  up to million of our common stock through december the facility is subject to early termination in specified circumstances 
in connection with this ceff  we issued a warrant to kingsbridge to purchase up to  shares of our common stock with an exercise price of per share 
the warrant is exercisable until june under the ceff  the maximum number of shares that we may sell to kingsbridge is  shares  exclusive of the shares underlying the warrant issued to kingsbridge 
subject to specified conditions and limitations  from time to time under the ceff  we may require kingsbridge to purchase shares of our common stock at a price that is between and of the volume weighted average price on each trading day during an eight day pricing period  provided that if the average market price on any day during the pricing period is less than the greater of or of the closing price of the day preceding the first day of the pricing period  then that day would not be used in determining the number of shares that would be issued in the draw down and the aggregate amount of the draw down would be decreased by one eighth 
the maximum dollar amount of shares that we may require kingsbridge to purchase in any pricing period is equal to the greater of a a percentage of our market capitalization as determined at the time of the draw down  which percentage ranges from to depending upon our market capitalization at the time of the draw down  or b four times the average trading volume of our common stock for a specified period prior to the draw down notice  multiplied by the closing price of the common stock on the trading day prior to the draw down notice  in each case subject to specified conditions 
if either of the foregoing calculations yields a draw down amount in excess of million  then the individual draw down amount is limited to million 
we filed a registration statement which became effective in december with respect to the resale of shares issuable under the ceff and underlying the warrant issued to kingsbridge  and the registration rights agreement requires us to maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement 
if we fail to maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement  or if we suspend the use of the registration statement  then under certain circumstances we may be required to pay certain amounts to kingsbridge  or issue to kingsbridge additional shares of common stock in lieu of cash payment  in each case as liquidated damages 
we are not obligated to sell any of the million of common stock available under the ceff and there are no minimum commitments or minimum use penalties 
the ceff does not contain any restrictions on our operating activities  automatic pricing resets or minimum market volume restrictions 
during the second quarter of we made our only draw downs to date under the ceff 
we issued a total of  shares of common stock to kingsbridge for aggregate gross proceeds of million 
the remaining amount available under the ceff has decreased to the lesser of million or  shares of common stock 
public offerings of common stock 
on november   we entered into a purchase agreement with piper jaffray co 
pursuant to which we sold  shares of our common stock at a price per share of 
our gross proceeds from the sale were million 
we incurred investment banking fees  legal fees and other financing costs of approximately million  resulting in net proceeds of million 

table of contents on march   we entered into an underwriting agreement with goldman  sachs co  as representative of the several underwriters  pursuant to which we issued an aggregate of  shares of common stock  including the exercise of an over allotment option for  shares  at a public offering price of per share  for gross proceeds of million 
after underwriting discount and estimated expenses payable by us of approximately million  net proceeds from the public offering were approximately million 
on august   we completed an underwritten public offering of  shares of common stock at a public offering price of per share for net proceeds of million  after deducting the underwriters discount and offering expenses paid by us 
contractual obligations we have contractual obligations related to our facility leases  research and development agreements and equipment financing agreements

in consideration for the licenses received  we are required to pay license and research support fees  milestone payments upon the achievement of certain success based objectives and  in some cases  royalties on future sales of commercialized products  if any 
we may also be required to pay minimum annual royalties and the costs associated with the prosecution and maintenance of the patents covering the licensed technology

recent accounting standards and pronouncements in october  the fasb issued asu no 
 revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force 
asu no 
 which amends existing revenue recognition accounting pronouncements and provides accounting principles and application guidance on the accounting for multiple element arrangements  including whether multiple deliverables exist  how the arrangement should be separated  and the consideration allocated 
this guidance eliminates the requirement to establish the fair value of undelivered products and services and instead provides for separate revenue recognition based upon management s estimate of the selling price for an undelivered item when there is no other means to determine the fair value of that undelivered item 
this guidance establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of each element within a multiple deliverable arrangement 
specifically  the selling price assigned to each deliverable is to be based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  if available  third party evidence  if vsoe is unavailable  and estimated selling prices  if neither vsoe nor third party evidence is available 
in addition  asu no 
requires allocation using the relative selling price method 
asu no 
will be effective prospectively for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements entered into  or materially modified  in fiscal years beginning on or after june  we will adopt this new approach prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after january  we anticipate that this standard will impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations in the event we complete future multiple element transactions  or modify existing collaborative relationships  for those transactions for which we conclude that the individual elements meet the criteria for standalone value 
we consider several factors when estimating the selling price of a license  including the rights received by the licensee  the stage of development and development timeline  the expected market size for the product candidate  the expected life 
table of contents if commercialized and consideration received for comparable deals 
had we adopted the new guidance effective january   giving consideration to accounting for all contractual arrangements using the new guidance  we estimate that we would have recognized approximately million of additional license revenues during in april  the fasb issued asu no 
 revenue recognition milestone method  or asu asu provides guidance in applying the milestone method of revenue recognition to research or development arrangements 
under this guidance  management may recognize revenue contingent upon the achievement of a milestone in its entirety in the period in which the milestone is achieved only if the milestone meets all the criteria within the guidance to be considered substantive 
asu is effective on a prospective basis for research and development milestones achieved in fiscal years beginning on or after june  we will implement asu effective january  and do not expect adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
cautionary note regarding forward looking statements any statements in this report about our expectations  beliefs  plans  objectives  assumptions or future events or performance are not historical facts and are forward looking statements 
such forward looking statements include statements regarding our available cash resources  our expectations regarding future revenue and expense levels  the efficacy  safety and intended utilization of our product candidates  the development of our clinical stage product candidates and our bite antibody technology  the future development of blinatumomab by us  the conduct  timing and results of ongoing and future clinical trials  plans regarding regulatory filings  our ability to draw down under the ceff and the availability of financing  and our plans regarding partnering activities 
you can identify these forward looking statements by the use of words or phrases such as believe  may  could  will  possible  can  estimate  continue  ongoing  consider  anticipate  intend  seek  plan  project  expect  should  would  or assume or the negative of these terms  or other comparable terminology  although not all forward looking statements contain these words 
among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward looking statements are risks and uncertainties inherent in our business including  without limitation  the progress  timing or success of our clinical trials  difficulties or delays in development  testing  obtaining regulatory approval for  producing and marketing our product candidates  regulatory developments in the united states or in foreign countries  the risks associated with our reliance on collaborations for the development and commercialization of our product candidates  unexpected adverse side effects or inadequate therapeutic efficacy of our product candidates that could delay or prevent product development or commercialization  or that could result in recalls or product liability claims  our ability to attract and retain key scientific  management or commercial personnel  the loss of key scientific  management or commercial personnel  the size and growth potential of the potential markets for our product candidates and our ability to serve those markets  the scope and validity of patent protection for our product candidates  competition from other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies  our ability to establish and maintain strategic collaborations or to otherwise obtain additional financing to support our operations on commercially reasonable terms  successful administration of our business and financial reporting capabilities  and other risks detailed in this report  including those above in item a  risk factors 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in our forward looking statements are reasonable  we cannot guarantee future results  events  levels of activity  performance or achievement

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates our financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents 
these financial instruments  principally comprised of corporate obligations and us and foreign government obligations  are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
because of the relatively short maturities of our investments  we do not expect interest rate fluctuations to materially affect the aggregate value of our financial instruments 
we do not have derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 

table of contents exchange rates a majority of our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments are denominated in us dollars  however  a significant percentage is denominated in euros 
because the us dollar is our reporting currency  these euro balances are translated into dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the end of each financial reporting period 
a majority of our operating expenses  including our research and development expenses  are incurred in europe pursuant to arrangements that are generally denominated in euros 
for financial reporting purposes  expenses incurred in euros are translated into u 
s dollars at the average exchange rate in effect during the period 
as a result  our financial results and capital resources are affected by changes in the us dollar euro exchange rate 
as of december   we had us dollar denominated cash and cash equivalents of million and euro denominated cash and investments of million  or approximately million using the exchange rate as of that date 
as of december   we had euro denominated liabilities of approximately million  or approximately million  using the exchange rate as of that date 
a decrease in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro would result in an increase in our reported operating expenses due to the translation of the euro denominated expenses into us dollars  and such changes would negatively impact the length of time that our existing capital resources would be sufficient to finance our operations 
we partially hedge euro denominated expenses budgeted over the next twelve months by maintaining an equivalent portfolio of euro denominated cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
in addition  several of our current collaboration agreements provide for our collaborators to reimburse us in euros for our development expenses incurred under those collaborations 
these collaboration agreements also provide for milestone payments to be paid in euros  which also hedges against currency fluctuations associated with our future euro denominated operating expenses and obligations 
the following table shows the hypothetical impact of the strengthening of the euro relative to the us dollar
