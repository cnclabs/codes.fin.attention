recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued authoritative guidance to allow entities to use a qualitative approach to test goodwill for impairment 
this authoritative guidance permits an entity to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
if it is concluded that this is the case  it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
otherwise  the two step goodwill impairment test is not required 
this guidance is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  and earlier adoption is permitted 
applied elected to adopt this authoritative guidance in fiscal the implementation of this authoritative guidance had no impact on applied s financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income to require an entity to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
this authoritative guidance eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of equity 
this guidance is effective for applied in the first quarter of fiscal  with early adoption permitted  and should be applied retrospectively 
the implementation of this authoritative guidance will change only the presentation of comprehensive income and will have no impact on applied s financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued authoritative guidance to provide a consistent definition of fair value and ensure that the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between us gaap and international financial reporting standards 
this authoritative guidance limits the highest and best use measure to nonfinancial assets  permits certain financial assets and liabilities with offsetting positions in market or counterparty credit risks to be measured at a net basis  and provides guidance on the applicability of premiums and discounts 
this authoritative guidance also expands the disclosures on level inputs by requiring quantitative disclosure of the unobservable inputs and assumptions  as well as description of the valuation processes and the sensitivity of the fair value to changes in unobservable inputs 
the new guidance will be effective for applied in the first quarter of fiscal the implementation of this authoritative guidance is not expected to have a material impact on applied s financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb amended its existing guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets 
this authoritative guidance modifies step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
for those reporting units  an entity is required to perform step of the goodwill impairment test if there are qualitative factors indicating that it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
the qualitative factors are consistent with the existing guidance which requires goodwill of a reporting unit to be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
this authoritative guidance becomes effective for applied in the first quarter fiscal the implementation of this authoritative guidance is not expected to have a material impact on applied s financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on business combinations 
this authoritative guidance requires a public entity that presents comparative financial statements to disclose the revenue and 
table of contents earnings of the combined entity as though the business combinations that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the prior annual reporting period 
in addition  this authoritative guidance expands the supplemental pro forma disclosures to include a description of the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported 
note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
table of contents describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies 
a critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of applied s consolidated financial statements and that requires management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on applied s financial condition or results of operations 
specifically  these policies have the following attributes applied is required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate  and different estimates applied could reasonably have used  or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur  would have a material effect on applied s financial condition or results of operations 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
applied bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as additional information is obtained and as applied s operating environment changes 
these changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known 
in addition  management is periodically faced with uncertainties  the outcomes of which are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time 
these uncertainties include those discussed in part i  item a  risk factors 
based on a critical assessment of its accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies  management believes that applied s consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  and provide a meaningful presentation of applied s financial condition and results of operations 
management believes that the following are critical accounting policies revenue recognition applied recognizes revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  seller s price to buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectability is probable 
each sale arrangement may contain commercial terms that differ from other arrangements 
in addition  applied frequently enters into contracts that contain multiple deliverables 
judgment is required to properly identify the accounting units of the multiple deliverable transactions and to determine the manner in which revenue should be allocated among the accounting units 
moreover  judgment is used in interpreting the commercial terms and determining when all criteria of revenue recognition have been met in order for revenue recognition to occur in the appropriate accounting period 
while changes in the allocation of the estimated sales price between the units of accounting will not affect the amount of total revenue recognized for a particular sales arrangement  any material changes in these allocations could impact the timing of revenue recognition  which could have a material effect on applied s financial condition and results of operations 
in  the financial accounting standards board issued amended revenue recognition guidance for arrangements with multiple deliverables and certain software sold with tangible products 
this guidance eliminated the residual method of revenue recognition and allows the use of management s best estimate of selling price for individual elements of an arrangement when vendor specific evidence or third party evidence is unavailable 
applied implemented this guidance prospectively beginning in the first quarter of fiscal for transactions that were initiated or materially modified during fiscal the implementation of the new guidance had an insignificant impact on reported net sales compared to net sales under previous guidance  as the new guidance did not change the units of accounting within sales arrangements and the elimination of the residual method for the allocation of arrangement consideration had an inconsequential impact on the amount and timing of reported net sales 
warranty costs applied provides for the estimated cost of warranty when revenue is recognized 
estimated warranty costs are determined by analyzing specific product  current and historical configuration statistics and regional warranty 
table of contents support costs 
applied s warranty obligation is affected by product and component failure rates  material usage and labor costs incurred in correcting product failures during the warranty period 
as applied s customer engineers and process support engineers are highly trained and deployed globally  labor availability is a significant factor in determining labor costs 
the quantity and availability of critical replacement parts is another significant factor in estimating warranty costs 
unforeseen component failures or exceptional component performance can also result in changes to warranty costs 
if actual warranty costs differ substantially from applied s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required  which could have a material adverse effect on applied s business  financial condition and results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts applied maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
this allowance is based on historical experience  credit evaluations  specific customer collection history and any customer specific issues applied has identified 
changes in circumstances  such as an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligation to applied or its payment trends  may require applied to further adjust its estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to applied  which could have a material adverse effect on applied s business  financial condition and results of operations 
inventory valuation inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined on a first in  first out basis 
the carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand 
applied evaluates the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand 
in addition  inventories are evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known and anticipated engineering change orders and new products 
if actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated  additional adjustments for excess or obsolete inventory may be required  which could have a material adverse effect on applied s business  financial condition and results of operations 
goodwill and intangible assets applied reviews goodwill and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable  and also annually reviews goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives for impairment 
intangible assets  such as purchased technology  are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition 
the value assigned to intangible assets is usually based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired 
if actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates  applied may be required to record an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the reporting unit to its realizable value 
the fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using both the income approach and the market approach taking into account such factors as future anticipated operating results and estimated cost of capital 
management uses significant judgment when assessing goodwill for potential impairment  especially in emerging markets 
a severe decline in market value could result in an unexpected impairment charge for impaired goodwill  which could have a material adverse effect on applied s business  financial condition and results of operations 
income taxes the effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings  tax regulations governing each region  non tax deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions and availability of tax credits 
management carefully monitors the changes in many factors and adjusts the effective income tax rate as required 
if actual results differ from these estimates  applied could be required to record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets or adjust its effective income tax rate  which could have a material adverse effect on applied s business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents applied accounts for income taxes by recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities using statutory tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities  net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets are also reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
management has determined that it is more likely than not that applied s future taxable income will be sufficient to realize its deferred tax assets  net of existing valuation allowance 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with applied s expectations could have a material impact on applied s results of operations and financial condition 
non gaap results management uses non gaap results to evaluate the company s operating and financial performance in light of business objectives and for planning purposes 
applied believes these measures enhance investors ability to review the company s business from the same perspective as the company s management and facilitate comparisons of this period s results with prior periods 
the non gaap results presented below exclude the impact of the following  where applicable restructuring and asset impairment charges and any associated adjustment related to restructuring actions  certain discrete tax items  certain acquisition related costs  investment impairments  and gain or loss on sale of facilities 
these non gaap measures are not in accordance with gaap and may differ from non gaap methods of accounting and reporting used by other companies 
the presentation of this additional information should not be considered a substitute for results prepared in accordance with gaap

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk applied is exposed to interest rate risk related to its investment portfolio and debt issuances 
applied s investment portfolio includes fixed income securities with a fair value of approximately billion at october  these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
based on applied s investment portfolio at october   an immediate basis point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of the portfolio of approximately million 
while an increase in interest rates reduces the fair value of the investment portfolio  applied will not realize the losses in the consolidated statement of operations unless the individual fixed income securities are sold prior to recovery or the loss is determined to be other than temporary 
at october   the carrying amount of debt issued by applied was billion with an estimated fair value of billion 
a hypothetical decrease in interest rates of basis points would result in an increase in the fair value of applied s debt issuances of approximately million at october  certain operations of applied are conducted in foreign currencies  such as japanese yen  euro  israeli shekel  taiwanese dollar and swiss franc 
applied enters into currency forward exchange and option contracts to hedge a portion of  but not all  existing and anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions expected to occur within months 
gains and losses on these contracts are generally recognized in income at the time that the related transactions being hedged are recognized 
because the effect of movements in currency exchange rates on currency forward exchange and option contracts generally offsets the related effect on the underlying items being hedged  these financial instruments are not expected to subject applied to risks that would otherwise result from changes in currency exchange rates 
applied does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
net foreign currency gains and losses were not material for fiscal
