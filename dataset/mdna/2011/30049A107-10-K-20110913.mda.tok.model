table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview general we are a petroleum company engaged primarily in the acquisition  exploitation and development of properties for the production of crude oil and natural gas  onshore in the united states 
we acquire known  underdeveloped oil and natural gas resources and exploit them through the application of capital  sound engineering and modern technology to increase production  ultimate recoveries  or both 
we are focused on increasing underlying asset values on a per share basis 
in doing so  we depend on a conservative capital structure  allowing us to maintain control of our assets for the benefit of our shareholders  including approximately beneficially owned by all of our employees 
our strategy is intended to generate scalable  low unit cost  development and re development opportunities that minimize or eliminate exploration risks 
these opportunities involve the application of modern technology  our own proprietary technology and our specific expertise in overlooked areas of the united states 
the assets we exploit currently fit into three types of project opportunities enhanced oil recovery eor  bypassed primary resources  and unconventional shale gas development 
we expect to fund our base fiscal development plan from working capital  with any increases to the base plan funded out of working capital  net cash flows from our properties in the giddings and delhi fields and appropriate financing vehicles  including possible additional issuances of our series a perpetual non convertible preferred stock 
highlights for our fiscal year oil gas reserves proved reserves increased million boe  or  while pv increased 
the increase in proved reserves is primarily due to an acceleration of our delhi payout date  estimated by d m to occur at calendar year end  versus last year s report estimate of mid acceleration of the payout date is primarily due to improved operating performance and higher oil prices 
the increase in pv is primarily due to higher oil prices  the increased reserves and the accelerated date of deemed payout 
proved developed reserves increased 
the increase in proved developed reserves is primarily due to continued investment by the operator in the delhi field  combined with improved production performance 
proved developed reserves are now of total proved reserves 

table of contents the improvement in proved and proved developed reserves did not materially affect our high oil content 
our proved reserves are oil and gas liquids  compared to and  respectively  the previous year 
proved probable change change reserves mmboe developed liquids in millions pv pv spot pv strip we believe the presentation of pv provides useful information to investors because it is widely used by analysts and investors in evaluating oil and natural gas companies and the relative monetary significance of their oil and natural gas properties 
pv is not intended to represent the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves  nor should it be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the standardized measure of after tax discounted future net cash flows as defined under gaap 
see estimated oil and natural gas reserves and estimated future net revenues under item properties of this form k for a reconciliation of pv to the standardized measure 
projects delhi 
d m s independent reserve report for our delhi interests reflects an acceleration of the reversionary working interest payout date to late calendar  more than two years earlier than projected in their june  report 
the acceleration is due primarily to a lower rate of co purchases  improved performance and higher realized oil price 
the same factors resulted in an increase of mmbo of net proved reserves primarily associated with the reversionary working interest 
proved developed reserves at delhi increased from of total proved reserves to of total proved reserves  due to continued investment by the operator and improved performance in the field 
production continues to increase as phase ii was implemented through first co injection in late december and first oil production response in march gross and net oil production increased to  gross net barrels of oil per day during the fourth fiscal quarter of from  gross net barrels of oil per day in the preceding third fiscal quarter  and increased from the fourth fiscal quarter ending june   the first full quarter of eor production 
both phases i and ii resulted in oil production response months earlier than projected 
meanwhile  phase iii is currently under construction and related co injection is expected during calendar up to six phases are ultimately expected  with phase i being approximately half the size of all other phases 
to date  the operator has reported expending million on the project  which has no effect on our deemed million reversionary payout amount 
gross production averaged more than  gross net barrels per day for fiscal year  compared to less than gross net barrels per day during fiscal our net production currently is from our royalty interest and is free and clear of all cost  except for a pipeline transportation tariff of less than per barrel 
our realized oil price at delhi tracks louisiana light sweet oil price  which has been similarly tracking brent crude oil price during the last half of as an example  our realized delhi oil price of in june was a premium over the price we realized in our properties in the giddings field 
the factors that impacted our proved reserves also increased our proved pv by to million and our probable pv by to million 
due to the accelerated reversion date  we now expect to bear approximately million of capital expenditures in calendar  compared to the year ago projection of no capital expenditures related to our proved reserves 
at reversion  our net revenue interest will increase from to  and we will begin bearing of all costs 

table of contents see estimated oil and natural gas reserves and estimated future net revenues under item properties of this form k for a reconciliation of pv to the standardized measure 
due to continued production testing during  we have elected to restore proved reserves for our properties in the lopez field in south texas neptune project 
previously  we had elected to downgrade our reserves in the lopez field due to difficulties and delays in creating adequate water injection capacity needed to adequately test production 
this problem was alleviated in the first half of fiscal and the resulting stable production demonstrated that proved reserves and expanded field development are warranted 
consequently  our independent reservoir engineer has assigned mbo of proved oil reserves to one producing well and five drilling locations  and mbo of probable oil reserves to drilling locations 
associated pv is thousand for proved reserves and million for probable reserves 
in giddings  our production of mboe was more than offset by mboe of positive proved reserve revisions 
sales of reserves in place totaling mboe resulted in a reduction in proved reserves to  mboe 
during  we drilled and completed three producing wells through our industry joint venture 
one well far exceeded expectations  one well underperformed and one well was not commercially productive in the target horizon and was subsequently recompleted into another reservoir 
in aggregate  we believe that the three wells are expected to approach combined expected recovery 
based on drilling results and natural gas prices  we highgraded our portfolio of remaining proved drilling locations to the current thirteen total 
our unconventional gas project is now focused on our haskell county  ok leasehold 
during the latter part of fiscal  we commenced our first test in haskell county  ok through a re entry 
during operations to create a salt water disposal zone  we encountered natural gas 
we subsequently revised our project to test this zone with a single stage of hydraulic fracturing 
we are currently producing the well to determine economic viability of further field development of this zone 
our independent reservoir engineer has assigned proved reserves to this one gross and net producing well and five gross and net drilling locations totaling mmcf 
we continued production testing of one shallow woodford well in our wagoner county  ok leasehold during the early portion of fiscal based on the results to date  combined with the natural gas market and requirement for substantial infrastructure  we have determined that our other projects offer more value potential and thus have elected to divest our wagoner county assets 
therefore  no reserves for wagoner county have been included in our reported reserves 
operations our fiscal net loss declined to  compared to fiscal s million loss 
the year ended on a positive note with net income of  and  in fq and fq  respectively 
revenues in fiscal increased to million  compared to million in fiscal  primarily due to a increase in oil volumes and increase in oil prices  partially offset by a decrease in ngl and natural gas volumes 

operating costs in fiscal decreased million to million  a decrease from fiscal  primarily due to a reduction in our annual depletion rate to per boe 
our depletion rate for fq was per boe due to the inclusion of net capital expenditures associated with the last phase of our delhi eor project resulting from the currently projected two year acceleration in payout 
we have not  to date  experienced a ceiling test write down of our oil and gas property costs  therefore our depletion rate is a proxy for our historic finding and development costs 
non cash  stock based compensation expense of million comprised over of general and administrative expense for fiscal non cash  stock based compensation expense remains an important part of our total compensation program  as a small company in competition for talented staff with numerous  more established other companies  to help motivate and retain high performing employees and consultants  in addition to conserving our cash resources 
for further details  see results of operations below 

table of contents finances we ended the year with million of working capital  compared to million at june  at june   working capital included million of cash  cash equivalents and short term certificates of deposit 
the million reduction in our working capital since june  was due primarily to capital investments of million in oil and natural gas properties  mostly offset by positive cash flow generated from our oil and gas properties 
cash flows from operations covered our general and administrative expenses and funded most of our capital expenditures 
cash flows from operations were million during the year ended june   which includes million received in february from the internal revenue service as a result of a carry back of our tax loss for the year ended june  we remained debt free 
all of our expenditures were funded solely by working capital and we ended our fiscal year with no funded debt 
looking forward into we currently expect to be more active during fiscal in the giddings field  haskell county  lopez field and artificial lift technology projects 
expanded development drilling in the first three projects will be funded from working capital  expected cash flows from operations and future joint ventures currently in discussion 
activity is intended to further our goal of maturing projects outside of delhi and derisking their future capital investment and associated production 
at the same time  we expect production at delhi to continue to increase as phase ii matures and phase iii is put into operation through incremental co injection 
our base case capital budget of up to million will be primarily focused on continued development drilling of our higher valued locations in the giddings field initial development rollout in the lopez field in south texas with two oil producers and two injectors projected initial development of the woodford shale in haskell county  ok demonstrations of garp  our artificial lift technology for other operators maintenance of leases on our higher valued drilling locations and haskell county leasehold and expansion of our lopez field leasehold as warranted we intend to generate and maintain substantial liquidity to allow us to take advantage of specific success in any one or more of the projects or other opportunities that may arise during the year due to unusual commodity price volatility or market disruption  including the possible repurchase of our common stock 
we remain committed to protecting our substantial value already created in our delhi assets and our conservative  flexible financial approach 
continued conservative financial management 
continue to emphasize long term share value over near term earnings during the current period of low natural gas prices 
retain financial strength and flexibility to assure we obtain proper value of our core assets and protect our joint venture rights in areas of mutual interest 
utilize joint ventures  project financing and or preferred stock issuances to accelerate project development 
we may accelerate our development operations where warranted by utilizing joint ventures  project financing  selective divestments of noncore assets or continued issuance of our preferred stock at an attractive valuation 
in early july we raised million of gross proceeds before offering expenses through an offering of  shares of series a preferred stock 
these shares are perpetual  nonconvertible and redeemable by the company at the per share liquidation value after three years  or earlier at a premium to the liquidation value in the event of a change in control 
we continue to sell up to an additional  shares through at the market transactions  which to date have been at a premium to the liquidation value of per share 
improve financial results through increasing production and revenues 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources at june   our working capital was million and we continued to be debt free 
this compares to working capital of million at june  the million decrease in working capital since june   was due primarily to investments of million in oil and natural gas properties  offset by an asset sale of million and positive operating cash flows 
of the million of capital expenditures incurred during our fiscal year ended june   million was for leasehold acquisitions and million was for development activities 
development activities were primarily in the giddings field in texas and our unconventional gas project in eastern oklahoma 
cash flows from operating activities cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended june  were million 
cash flows provided by operations included cash receipts of million from oil and natural gas sales from our properties in the giddings field and the delhi field and million due to a refund from the carry back of our federal income tax loss 
cash payments included million for operating expenses  including lease operating expenses  production taxes  salaries and wages  million related to our joint interest partner s share of capital expenditures and which are due from our joint interest partner  and million in estimated state income taxes 
cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended june  were million 
cash flows provided by operations include cash receipts of million from oil and natural gas sales  primarily from our properties in the giddings field  cash receipts of million from the internal revenue service due to our tax year net operating loss carry back  and interest received of million 
total cash received of million was partially offset by million of cash payments for operating expenses  including lease operating expenses  production taxes  salaries and wages  and payment of million in state income taxes 
cash flows from investing activities cash paid for oil and gas capital expenditures during our fiscal year ended june  and  was million and million  respectively  which includes net payments on accounts payable of million during both periods  relating to expenditures for oil and natural gas properties 
during the year ended june   we received million for a lease sale in the giddings field 
during the year ended june   million of certificates of deposit matured 
during the year ended june   we purchased million in short term certificates of deposit and million of certificates of deposit matured 
cash flows from financing activities during the year ended june   we received million due to the exercise of stock options and million for windfall tax benefit received in there were no significant cash flows from financing activities during the year ended june  capital budget for our fiscal plan  we expect to incur capital expenditures of up to million for expenditure details  see the looking forward section above 
we expect to fund our fiscal plan with internally generated funds  our working capital and future joint ventures 
increases in our activity level over the planned operations will be funded from working capital  joint ventures  project financing  selective divestments of noncore assets or from additional sales of our preferred stock

net loss 
for the year ended june   we reported a net loss of  or loss per share which includes  of non cash stock based compensation expense on total oil and natural gas revenues of  this compares to a net loss of  or loss per share which includes  of non cash stock based compensation expense on total oil and natural gas revenues of  for the year ended june  the decrease in net loss was primarily due to an increase in our revenues of  and a decrease in operating costs of  primarily related to a decrease in depreciation  depletion  and amortization 
additional details of the components of net loss are explained in greater detail below 
sales volumes 
crude oil  ngls  and natural gas sales volumes  net to our interest  for the year ended june  decreased to  boe  compared to  boe for the year ended june  our crude oil sales volumes for the year ended june  included  bbls of oil from delhi   bbls of oil from our properties in the giddings field in texas and bbls of oil from our south texas properties 
our crude oil sales volumes for the year ended june  included  bbls of oil from delhi of which  bbls of oil were sold during the th quarter of and  bbls from our properties in the giddings field in texas 
our natural gas liquids production were entirely from our properties in the giddings field for the years ended june  and 
table of contents natural gas production for the year ended june   included  mcfs from our properties in oklahoma and  mcfs from our properties in the giddings field 
natural gas production for the year ended june  was entirely from our properties in the giddings field 
petroleum revenues 
crude oil  ngls and natural gas revenues for the year ended june  increased from the year ended june  this was due to a increase in liquid volumes  offset by a decline in natural gas production  and a increase in the average price received per boe  from per boe for the year ended june  to per boe for the year ended june  lease operating expenses including production severance taxes 
lease operating expenses and production taxes for the year ended june  decreased compared to the year ended june   primarily due to a significant reduction in saltwater disposal costs  due to our pearson salt water disposal well  and decreased workover costs during the year ended june  lease operating expense and production taxes per barrel of oil equivalent decreased from per boe during fiscal  to per boe during fiscal general and administrative expenses g a 
g a expenses increased to million for the year ended june   compared to million for the year ended june  the increase was due primarily to an increase in personnel costs of approximately thousand offset by a reduction in stock based compensation of approximately thousand 
we accrued for a cash bonus of thousand for the year ended june   whereas in the prior year the bonus was paid in stock and accrued thousand as stock based compensation 
the remaining increase in personnel costs were due to cost of living adjustments and a lower allocation of engineer costs to properties during the year ended june  non cash stock based compensation of  of total g a and  of total g a for the year ended june  and  respectively  is an integral part of total staff compensation utilized to recruit quality staff from other  more established companies and  as a result  will likely continue to be a significant component of our g a costs 
depreciation  depletion amortization expense dd a 
dd a decreased by to  for year ended june   compared to  for the year ended june  the decrease is primarily due to a decrease in net sales volumes  and a lower annual depletion rate vs 
per boe 
our depletion rate decreased significantly in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  when we first recorded reserves at delhi of million proved oil reserves with associated legacy costs of only million transferred to our full cost pool 
interest income 
interest income for the year ended june  decreased  to  compared to  for the year ended june  the decrease in interest income is due to lower average daily balances of cash and short term certificates of deposit and a reduction in market interest rates received on invested cash 
inflation 
although the general inflation rate in the united states  as measured by the consumer price index and the producer price index  has been relatively low in recent years  the oil and gas industry has experienced unusually volatile price movements in commodity prices  vendor goods and oilfield services 
prices for drilling and oilfield services  oilfield equipment  tubulars  labor  expertise and other services greatly impact our lease operating expenses and our capital expenditures 
during fiscal and into fiscal  we saw a substantial decline in both petroleum product prices and drilling and oilfield services costs from prior years  followed more recently by moderate increases in products and services  particularly drilling rig and hydraulic fracturing rates 
product prices  operating costs and development costs may not always move in tandem 
known trends and uncertainties 
general worldwide economic conditions continue to be uncertain and volatile 
concerns over uncertain future economic growth are affecting numerous industries  companies  as well as consumers  which impact demand for crude oil and natural gas 
if demand decreases in the future  it may put downward pressure on crude oil and natural gas prices  thereby lowering our revenues and working capital going forward 
seasonality 
our business is generally not directly seasonal  except for instances when weather conditions may adversely affect access to our properties or delivery of our petroleum products 
although we do not generally modify our production for changes in market demand  we do experience seasonality in the product prices we receive  driven by summer cooling and driving  winter heating  and extremes in seasonal weather including hurricanes that may substantially affect oil and natural gas production and imports 

table of contents contractual obligations and other commitments the table below provides estimates of the timing of future payments that  as of june   we are obligated to make under our contractual obligations and commitments 
we expect to fund these contractual obligations with cash on hand and cash generated from operations 
payments due by period total less than year years years after years in thousands contractual obligations operating lease other obligations asset retirement obligations total obligations critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires that we select certain accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these policies  together with our estimates have a significant affect on our consolidated financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
following is a discussion of our most critical accounting estimates  judgments and uncertainties that are inherent in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
oil and natural gas properties 
companies engaged in the production of oil and natural gas are required to follow accounting rules that are unique to the oil and gas industry 
we apply the full cost accounting method for our oil and natural gas properties as prescribed by sec regulation s x rule under this method of accounting  the costs of unsuccessful  as well as successful  exploration and development activities are capitalized as properties and equipment 
this includes any internal costs that are directly related to property acquisition  exploration and development activities but does not include any costs related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
gain or loss on the sale or other disposition of oil and gas properties is not recognized  unless the gain or loss would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves 
oil and natural gas properties include costs that are excluded from costs being depleted or amortized 
oil and natural gas property costs excluded represent investments in unevaluated properties and include non producing leasehold  geological and geophysical costs associated with leasehold or drilling interests and exploration drilling costs 
we exclude these costs until the property has been evaluated 
costs are transferred to the full cost pool as the properties are evaluated 
as of june   our total unevaluated costs were million 
if these costs were evaluated and included in our full cost pool  with no increases in our proved reserves as of june   our depreciation  depletion and amortization expense would have increased by approximately  estimates of proved reserves 
the estimated quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves have a significant impact on the underlying financial statements 
the estimated quantities of proved reserves are used to calculate depletion expense  and the estimated future net cash flows associated with those proved reserves is the basis in determining impairment under the quarterly ceiling test calculation 
the process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is very complex  requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of all available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data 
estimated reserves are often subject to future revisions  which could be substantial  based on the availability of additional information  including reservoir performance  additional development activity  new geological and geophysical data  additional drilling  technological advancements  price changes and other economic factors 
as a result  material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time 
although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that the reported reserve estimates represent the most accurate assessments possible  including the hiring of independent engineers to prepare our reserve estimates  the subjective decisions and variances in available data for the properties make these estimates generally less precise than other estimates included in our financial statements 
material revisions to reserve estimates and or significant changes in commodity prices could substantially affect our estimated future net cash flows of our proved reserves  affecting our quarterly ceiling test calculation and could significantly affect our depletion rate 
a decrease in commodity prices used to determine our proved reserves and standardized measure as of june   would not have resulted in an impairment of our oil and natural gas properties 
holding all other factors constant  a reduction in the company s proved reserve estimate at june  of  and would affect depreciation  depletion and amortization expense by approximately   and  respectively 
on december   the sec issued its final rule on the modernization of reporting oil and gas reserves 
the new rule allows consideration of new technologies in evaluating reserves  allows companies to disclose their probable and possible reserves to investors  requires reporting of oil and gas reserves using an average price based on the previous month unweighted arithmetic average first day of the month price rather than year end prices  revises the disclosure requirements for oil and gas operations  and revises accounting for the limitation on capitalized costs for full cost companies 
the new rule became effective for our annual report on form k for the most recent fiscal year ended june  and did not have a material affect on our financial statements 

table of contents valuation of deferred tax assets 
we make certain estimates and judgments in determining our income tax expense for financial reporting purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing and recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial reporting purposes 
our federal and state income tax returns are generally not prepared or filed before the consolidated financial statements are prepared or filed  therefore  we estimate the tax basis of our assets and liabilities at the end of each period as well as the effects of tax rate changes  tax credits  and net operating loss carry backs and carry forwards 
adjustments related to these estimates are recorded in our tax provision in the period in which we file our income tax returns 
further  we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover or utilize our deferred tax assets primarily our net operating loss 
if recovery is not likely  we must record a valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets for the amount we would not expect to recover  which would result in an increase to our income tax expense 
as of june   we have recorded a valuation allowance for the portion of our net operating loss that is limited by irs section management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making the assessment of the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets 
based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods for which the deferred tax assets are deductible  as of end of the current fiscal year  we believe that it is more likely than not that the company will realize the benefits of its net deferred tax assets 
if our estimates and judgments change regarding our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets  our tax provision would increase in the period it is determined that recovery is not probable 
stock based compensation 
we estimate the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
this valuation method requires the input of certain assumptions  including expected stock price volatility  expected term of the award  the expected risk free interest rate  and the expected dividend yield of the company s stock 
the risk free interest rate used is the us treasury yield for bonds matching the expected term of the option on the date of grant 
our dividend yield is zero  as we do not pay a dividend 
because of our limited trading experience of our common stock and limited exercise history of our stock option awards  estimating the volatility and expected term is very subjective 
we base our estimate of our expected future volatility  on peer companies whose common stock has been trading longer than ours  along with our own limited trading history while operating as an oil and natural gas producer 
future estimates of our stock volatility could be substantially different from our current estimate  which could significantly affect the amount of expense we recognize for our stock based compensation awards 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet arrangements as of june  
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates 
changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
commodity price risk our most significant market risk is the pricing for crude oil  natural gas and ngls 
we expect energy prices to remain volatile and unpredictable 
if energy prices decline significantly  revenues and cash flow would significantly decline 
in addition  a non cash write down of our oil and gas properties could be required under full cost accounting rules if future oil and gas commodity prices sustained a significant decline 
prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow and raise additional capital  as  if and when needed 
although our current production base may not be sufficient enough to effectively allow hedging  we may use derivative instruments to hedge our commodity price risk
