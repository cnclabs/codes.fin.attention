item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations economic conditions and utility load growth for information on economic conditions in our service territory 
electric operations in addition to providing electric distribution and transmission services  we generate electricity from facilities that we own and we purchase capacity and energy and fuel for generation under long term and short term contracts 
we also sell capacity and energy  and surplus fuel in the wholesale market in connection with our resource optimization activities as described below 
as part of our resource procurement and management operations in the electric business  we engage in an ongoing process of resource optimization  which involves the economic selection from available energy resources to serve our load obligations and the use of these resources to capture available economic value 
we sell and purchase wholesale electric capacity and energy and fuel as part of the process of acquiring and balancing resources to serve our load obligations 
these transactions range from terms of one hour up to multiple years 
we make continuing projections of electric loads at various points in time ranging from one hour to multiple years based on  among other things  estimates of customer usage and weather  historical data and contract terms  and resource availability at these points in time based on  among other things  fuel choices and fuel markets  estimates of streamflows  availability of generating units  historic and forward market information  contract terms  and experience 
on the basis of these projections  we make purchases and sales of electric capacity and energy and fuel to match expected resources to expected electric load requirements 
resource optimization involves generating plant dispatch and scheduling available resources and also includes transactions such as purchasing fuel for generation  when economical  selling fuel and substituting wholesale electric purchases  and other wholesale transactions to capture the value of generation and transmission resources and fuel delivery capacity contracts 
our optimization process includes entering into hedging transactions to manage risks 
our generation assets are interconnected through the regional transmission system and are operated on a coordinated basis to enhance load serving capability and reliability 
we provide transmission and ancillary services in eastern washington  northern idaho and western montana 
transmission revenues were million in  million in and million in electric requirements our peak electric native load requirement for occurred on november  at which time our total obligation was  mw consisting of native load of  mw  long term wholesale obligations of mw  and short term wholesale obligations of mw 
at that time our maximum resource capacity available was  mw  which included company owned electric generation of  mw  long term hydroelectric contracts with certain public utility districts puds of mw  other long term wholesale contracts of mw  and short term wholesale purchases of mw 

table of contents avista corporation electric resources we have a diverse electric resource mix of hydroelectric projects  thermal generating facilities  and power purchases and exchanges 
at the end of  our facilities had a total net capability of  mw  of which percent was hydroelectric and percent was thermal 
see item properties for detailed information on generating facilities 
hydroelectric resources we own and operate six hydroelectric projects on the spokane river and two hydroelectric projects on the clark fork river 
hydroelectric generation is our lowest cost source per megawatt hour mwh of electricity and the availability of hydroelectric generation has a significant effect on total power supply costs 
under normal streamflow and operating conditions  we estimate that we would be able to meet approximately one half of our total average electric requirements both retail and long term wholesale with the combination of our hydroelectric generation and long term hydroelectric purchase contracts with certain puds in the state of washington 
our estimate of normal annual hydroelectric generation for including resources purchased under long term hydroelectric contracts with certain puds is average megawatts amw or million mwhs

a combination of long term contracts and spot purchases has provided  and is expected to meet  fuel requirements for the kettle falls gs 
the northeast ct  rathdrum ct  boulder park and kettle falls ct generating units are primarily used to meet peaking electric requirements 
we also operate these facilities when marginal costs are below prevailing wholesale electric prices 
these generating facilities have access to natural gas supplies that are adequate to meet their respective operating needs

all of the output from the lancaster plant is contracted to us through under a power purchase agreement 
the majority of the rights and obligations under this agreement were conveyed to shell energy through the end of these rights and obligations were conveyed to avista corp 
avista utilities beginning in january in idaho  the net costs of the lancaster power purchase agreement were determined to be prudent by the idaho public utilities commission ipuc and are currently being recovered through general rates and the power cost adjustment mechanism 
in washington  the washington utilities and transportation commission wutc initially did not allow us to include the costs associated with the power purchase agreement for the lancaster plant in rates 
we subsequently filed for and received approval for deferred accounting treatment for these net costs 
in the washington general rate case settlement  the parties agreed that recovery of the deferred net costs associated with the power purchase agreement for the lancaster plant would be limited to million for these net deferred costs will be recovered over a five year amortization period with a rate of return on the unamortized balance 
the parties agreed that the costs for the lancaster plant for and going forward are reasonable and should be recovered in rates 
as part of the settlement related to the lancaster plant deferred net costs  the parties agreed that there would be no deferrals under the erm for other purchases  exchanges and sales we purchase and sell power under various long term contracts 
we also enter into short term purchases and sales 
see electric operations for additional information with respect to the use of wholesale purchases and sales as part of our resource optimization process 
pursuant to the public utility regulatory policies act of purpa  as amended by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc as required by the energy policy act of energy policy act  we are required to purchase generation from qualifying facilities 
this includes  among other resources  hydroelectric projects  cogeneration projects and wind generation projects at rates approved by the wutc and the ipuc 
existing contracts expire at various times between and see avista utilities operating statistics electric operations electric energy resources for annual quantities of purchased power  wholesale power sales and power from exchanges in  and hydroelectric licensing we are a licensee under the federal power act as administered by the ferc  which includes regulation of hydroelectric generation resources 
except for the little falls plant  all of our hydroelectric plants are regulated by the ferc through project licenses 
the licensed projects are subject to the provisions of part i of the federal power act 
these provisions include payment for headwater benefits  condemnation of licensed projects upon payment of just compensation  and take over of such projects after the expiration of the license upon payment of the lesser of net investment or fair value of the project  in either case  plus severance damages 
in march  we received a year operating license from the ferc for the cabinet gorge hydroelectric generating project cabinet gorge and the noxon rapids hydroelectric generating project noxon rapids 
as part of the clark fork settlement agreement  we initiated the implementation of protection  mitigation and enhancement measures in march measures in the agreement address issues related to fisheries  water quality  wildlife  recreation  land use  cultural resources and erosion

table of contents avista corporation future resource needs we have operational strategies to provide sufficient resources to meet our energy requirements under a range of operating conditions 
these operational strategies consider the amount of energy needed over hourly  daily  monthly and annual durations  which vary widely because of the factors that influence demand 
our average hourly load was  amw in   amw in and  amw in the following is a forecast of our average annual energy requirements and resources for   and forecasted electric energy requirements and resources amw requirements system load contracts for power sales total requirements resources company owned and contract hydro generation company owned base load thermal generation contracts for power purchases total resources surplus resources additional available energy total surplus resources the forecast assumes near normal hydroelectric generation 
excludes the northeast ct and rathdrum ct 
we generally use these resources to meet electric load requirements due to either below normal hydroelectric generation or increased loads or outages at other generating facilities  and or when operating costs are lower than short term wholesale market prices 
northeast ct and rathdrum ct 
the combined maximum capacity of the northeast ct and rathdrum ct is mw  with estimated available energy production as indicated for each year 
in the third quarter of  we filed our electric integrated resource plan irp with the wutc and the ipuc 
the irp identifies a strategic resource portfolio that meets future electric load requirements  promotes environmental stewardship and meets our obligation to provide reliable electric service to customers at rates  terms and conditions that are fair  just  reasonable and sufficient 
we regard the irp as a tool for resource evaluation  rather than an acquisition plan for a particular project 
highlights of the irp include up to mw of wind power by  an additional mw of wind power by  mw of natural gas fired generation facilities  aggressive energy efficiency measures to reduce generation requirements by percent or mw  transmission upgrades to integrate new generation resources into our system  and hydroelectric upgrades at existing facilities to generate additional renewable energy 
we are required to file an irp every two years 
we will file an irp in august and our resource strategy may change from the highlights included above based upon market  legislative and regulatory developments 
we are subject to the washington state energy independence act  which includes renewable energy portfolio standards and we must obtain a portion of our electricity from qualifying renewable resources or through purchase of renewable energy credits 
our irp identified that additional qualifying renewable energy is needed by and that new capacity and energy resources are needed by in february  we issued a request for proposals rfp seeking qualifying renewable electric resources to meet a portion of our renewable energy portfolio standards requirements under the washington state energy independence act 
we seek to acquire up to amw of renewable energy  or as much as mw of nameplate wind capacity with deliveries beginning in we have issued this rfp due to recent market changes  tax incentives that remain in effect and a recent wutc policy statement indicating support of the acquisition of renewable resources in advance of renewable portfolio standards deadlines  if early acquisition can be cost justified 
we completed the acquisition of the development rights for a wind generation site in 
while this rfp does not include the development of this site  we will continue to study this site in preparation for later development 
we plan to meet the state of washington s renewable energy standards until with a combination of qualified upgrades at our existing hydroelectric generation plants and the purchase of a small amount of renewable energy credits from through 
table of contents avista corporation future generation resource decisions will be impacted by legislation for restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions and renewable energy requirements 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations environmental issues and other contingencies for information related to existing laws  as well as potential legislation that could influence our future electric resource mix 
natural gas operations general we provide natural gas distribution services to retail customers in parts of eastern washington  northern idaho  and parts of northeast and southwest oregon 
market prices for natural gas  like other commodities  can be volatile 
to provide reliable supply and to manage the impact of volatile prices on our customers  we procure natural gas through a diversified mix of spot market purchases and forward fixed price purchases from various supply basins and over various time periods 
we also use natural gas storage capacity to support high demand periods and to procure natural gas when prices may be seasonally lower 
securing prices throughout the year and even into subsequent years mitigates potential adverse impacts of significant purchase requirements in a volatile price environment 
like prices  natural gas loads can also be volatile 
daily natural gas loads can differ significantly from the monthly load projections 
we make continuing projections of our natural gas loads and assess available natural gas resources 
on the basis of these projections  we plan and execute a series of transactions to hedge a significant portion of our projected natural gas requirements through forward market transactions and derivative instruments 
these transactions may extend for multiple years into the future with the highest volumes hedged for the current and most immediately upcoming natural gas operating year november through october 
we also leave a significant portion of our natural gas supply requirements unhedged for purchase in short term and spot markets 
as part of the process of balancing natural gas retail load requirements with resources  we engage in wholesale purchases and sales of natural gas 
we also optimize natural gas resources by using excess resources and market opportunities to generate economic value that reduces retail rates 
wholesale sales are delivered through wholesale market facilities outside of our natural gas distribution system 
natural gas resource optimization activities include  but are not limited to wholesale market sales of surplus natural gas supplies  purchases and sales of natural gas to optimize use of pipeline and storage capacity 
we also provide transportation service to certain large commercial and industrial natural gas customers who purchase natural gas through third party marketers 
for these customers  we move their natural gas through our distribution system from natural gas transmission pipeline delivery points to the customers premises 
the total volume transported on behalf of our transportation customers for  and was  and million therms  representing percent  percent and percent of total system deliveries 
natural gas supply we purchase all of our natural gas in wholesale markets 
we are connected to multiple supply basins in the western united states and western canada through firm capacity delivery rights on six pipeline networks 
access to this diverse portfolio of natural gas resources allows us to make natural gas procurement decisions that benefit our natural gas customers 
we have interstate pipeline capacity to serve approximately percent of natural gas supplies from domestic sources  with the remaining percent from canadian sources 
natural gas prices in the pacific northwest are affected by global energy markets  as well as supply and demand factors in other regions of the united states and canada 
future prices and delivery constraints may cause our source mix to vary 
natural gas storage we own a one third interest in the jackson prairie natural gas storage project jackson prairie  an underground natural gas storage field located near chehalis  washington 
jackson prairie has a total peak day deliverability of million therms  with a total working natural gas capacity of million therms 
avista utilities will gain million therms of additional capacity at jackson prairie on may  for use in its utility operations 
this capacity was originally held by avista energy and as part of the asset sales agreement this capacity is assigned to shell energy through april  we also contract with northwest natural gas for storage at the mist natural gas storage facility 
this contract is for million therms of capacity and up to million therms of deliverability 
this contract expires on march  
table of contents avista corporation natural gas storage enables us to place natural gas into storage when prices may be lower or to satisfy minimum natural gas purchasing requirements  as well as to meet high demand periods or to withdraw natural gas from storage when spot prices are higher 
regulatory issues general as a regulated public utility  we are subject to regulation by state utility commissions for prices  accounting  the issuance of securities and other matters 
the retail electric and natural gas operations are subject to the jurisdiction of the wutc  the ipuc  the public utility commission of oregon opuc  and the public service commission of the state of montana montana commission 
approval of the issuance of securities is not required from the montana commission 
we are also subject to the jurisdiction of the ferc for licensing of hydroelectric generation resources  and for electric transmission services and wholesale sales 
our rates for retail electric and natural gas services other than specially negotiated retail rates for industrial or large commercial customers  which are subject to regulatory review and approval are determined on a cost of service basis 
rates are designed to provide  after recovery of allowable operating expenses  an opportunity for us to earn a reasonable return on rate base 
rate base is generally determined by reference to the original cost net of accumulated depreciation of utility plant in service  subject to various adjustments for deferred taxes and other items 
over time  rate base is increased by additions to utility plant in service and reduced by depreciation and retirement of utility plant and write offs as authorized by the utility commissions 
in general  a request for new rates in washington and idaho is made on the basis of net investment  operating expenses and revenues as of a date prior to the date of the request 
although the current ratemaking process in these states provides recovery of some future changes in net investment  operating costs and revenues  it does not reflect all changes in costs for the period in which new retail rates will be in place 
this historically has resulted in a lag between the time we incur costs and the time when we start recovering the costs through subsequent changes in rates 
oregon currently allows a forecasted test year  which generally is more effective in providing timely recovery of costs 
our rates for wholesale electric and natural gas transmission services are based on either cost of service principles or market based rates as set forth by the ferc 
see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about regulation  depreciation and deferred income taxes 
general rate cases we regularly review the need for electric and natural gas rate changes in each state in which we provide service 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations avista utilities regulatory matters general rate cases for information on general rate case activity 
power cost deferrals we defer the recognition in the income statement of certain power supply costs that vary from the level currently recovered from our retail customers as authorized by the wutc and the ipuc 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations avista utilities regulatory matters power cost deferrals and recovery mechanisms and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for detailed information on power cost deferrals and recovery mechanisms in washington and idaho 
purchased gas adjustment pga under established regulatory practices in each respective state  we are allowed to adjust natural gas rates periodically with regulatory approval to reflect increases or decreases in the cost of natural gas purchased 
differences between actual natural gas costs and the natural gas costs included in retail rates are deferred and charged or credited to expense when regulators approve inclusion of the cost changes in rates 
we typically propose such adjustments at least once per year 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations avista utilities regulatory matters purchased gas adjustments and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for detailed information on natural gas cost deferrals and recovery mechanisms in washington  idaho and oregon 
federal laws related to wholesale competition federal law promotes practices that open the electric wholesale energy market to competition 
the ferc requires electric utilities to transmit power and energy to or for wholesale purchasers and sellers  and requires electric utilities to enhance or construct transmission facilities to create additional transmission capacity for the purpose of providing these services 
public utilities through subsidiaries and other entities may participate in the development of independent electric generating plants for sales to wholesale customers 
public utilities operating under the federal power act are required to provide open and non discriminatory access to their transmission systems to third parties and establish an open access same time information system to provide an electronic means by which transmission customers can obtain information about available transmission capacity and purchase transmission access 
the ferc also requires each public utility subject to the rules to operate its transmission and wholesale power merchant operating functions separately and to comply with standards of conduct designed to ensure that all wholesale users  including the public utility s power merchant operations  have equal access to the public utility s transmission system 
our compliance with these standards has not had any substantive impact on the operation  maintenance and marketing of our transmission system or our ability to provide service to customers 

table of contents avista corporation regional transmission organizations beginning with ferc orders no 
and no 
issued in and continuing with subsequent rulemakings and policies  the ferc has encouraged the formation of various forms of regional transmission organizations rtos  including independent system operators isos 
while it has not mandated iso formation  the ferc has issued orders and made public policy statements indicating its support for the development and formation of regional independently governed transmission organizations  including those intended to implement a number of regional transmission planning coordination requirements 
we have participated in discussions with transmission providers and other stakeholders in the pacific northwest for several years regarding the possible formation of an iso in the region 
we ultimately became a member of columbiagrid  a washington nonprofit membership corporation with an independent slate of directors formed to improve the operational efficiency  reliability  and planned expansion of the transmission grid in the pacific northwest 
columbiagrid is not an iso  but performs limited functions as set forth in specific agreements with columbiagrid members and other stakeholders 
columbiagrid and its members also work with other western rtos and groups to address operational efficiencies  including westconnect and the northern tier transmission group 
we will continue to assess the benefits of entering into other functional agreements with columbiagrid and or participating in other forums to attain operational efficiencies and to meet ferc policy objectives 
the ferc requires rtos to provide various data and is currently requesting non rto regions to report similar data for the purpose of establishing performance metrics 
we expect the ferc to use this data to compare rto and non rto regions 
we cannot foresee what policy objectives the ferc may develop as a result of establishing such performance metrics 
reliability standards among its other provisions  the us energy policy act provides for the implementation of mandatory reliability standards and authorizes the ferc to assess fines for non compliance with these standards and other ferc regulations 
the ferc subsequently certified the north american electricity reliability corporation nerc as the single electric reliability organization authorized to establish and enforce reliability standards and delegate authority to regional entities for the purpose of establishing and enforcing reliability standards 
as of january  the ferc has approved nerc reliability standards  including nine western region standards  making up the set of legally enforceable standards for the united states bulk electric system 
the first of these reliability standards became effective in june we are required to self certify our compliance with these standards on an annual basis and undergo regularly scheduled periodic reviews by the nerc and its regional entity  the western electricity coordinating council wecc 
our failure to comply with these standards could result in financial penalties of up to million per day per violation 
annual self certification and audit processes to date have demonstrated our substantial compliance with these standards

table of contents avista corporation item a 
risk factors risk factors the following factors could have a significant impact on our operations  results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
these factors could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those discussed in our reports filed with the securities and exchange commission including this annual report on form k  and elsewhere 
please also see forward looking statements for additional factors which could have a significant impact on our operations  results of operations  financial condition or cash flows and could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in such statements 
weather temperatures  precipitation levels and storms has a significant effect on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
weather impacts are described in the following subtopics retail electricity and natural gas sales  the cost of natural gas supply  the cost of power supply  and damages to facilities 
retail electricity and natural gas sales volumes vary directly with changes in temperatures 
we normally have our highest retail electric and natural gas energy sales during the winter heating season in the first and fourth quarters of the year 
we also have high electricity demand for air conditioning during the summer third quarter 
in general  warmer weather in the heating season and cooler weather in the cooling season will reduce our customers energy demand and retail operating revenues 
the cost of natural gas supply tends to increase with increased demand during periods of cold weather 
increased costs adversely affect cash flows when we purchase natural gas for retail supply at prices above the amount then allowed for recovery in retail rates 
we defer differences between actual natural gas supply costs and the amount currently recovered in retail rates and we have generally been allowed to recover substantially all of these differences after regulatory review 
however  these deferred costs require cash outflows from the time of natural gas purchases until the costs are later recovered through retail sales 
the cost of power supply can be significantly impacted by weather 
precipitation consisting of snowpack  its water content and melting pattern plus rainfall and other streamflow conditions such as regional water storage operations significantly affect hydroelectric generation capability 
variations in hydroelectric generation inversely affect our reliance on market purchases and thermal generation 
to the extent that hydroelectric generation is less than normal  significantly more costly power supply resources must be acquired and the ability to realize net benefits from surplus hydroelectric wholesale sales is reduced 
the price of power in the wholesale energy markets tends to be higher during periods of high regional demand  such as occurs with temperature extremes 
we may need to purchase power in the wholesale market during peak price periods 
the price of natural gas as fuel for natural gas fired electric generation also tends to increase during periods of high demand which are often related to temperature extremes 
we may need to purchase natural gas fuel in these periods of high prices to meet electric demands 
the cost of power supply during peak usage periods may be higher than the retail sales price or the amount allowed in retail rates by our regulators 
to the extent that power supply costs are above the amount allowed currently in retail rates  the difference is partially absorbed by the company in current expense and it is partially deferred or shared with customers through regulatory mechanisms 
therefore  the impact on our results of operations may be larger or smaller than the weather related impact on power supply cost 
as a result of these factors operating in combination  our net cost of power supply the difference between our costs of generation and market purchases  reduced by our revenue from wholesale sales varies significantly because of weather 
damages to facilities may be caused by severe weather  such as snow  ice or wind storms 
the cost to implement rapid repair to such facilities can be significant 
overhead electric lines are most susceptible to such severe weather 
collateral damage from utility assets that are damaged by external forces may result in third party claims against the company for property damage and or personal injuries 

table of contents avista corporation we are subject to commodity price risk 
a combination of factors exposes our operations to commodity price risks 
we rely on energy markets and other counterparties for energy supply  surplus and optimization transactions and commodity price hedging 
these factors include our obligation to serve our retail customers at rates set through the regulatory process 
we cannot change retail rates to reflect current energy prices unless and until we receive regulatory approval 
customer demand  which is beyond our control because of weather  customer choices  prevailing economic conditions and other factors 
some of our energy supply cost is fixed by nature of the energy producing assets or through contractual arrangements 
however  a significant portion of our energy resource costs are not fixed 
because we must supply the amount of energy demanded by our customers and we must sell it at fixed rates and only a portion of our energy supply costs are fixed  we are subject to the risk of buying energy at higher prices in wholesale energy markets and the risk of selling energy at lower prices if we are in a surplus position 
electricity and natural gas in wholesale markets are commodities with historically high price volatility 
changes in wholesale energy prices affect  among other things  the cash requirements to purchase electricity and natural gas for retail customers or wholesale obligations and the market value of derivative assets and liabilities 
when we enter into fixed price energy commodity transactions for future delivery  we are subject to credit terms that may require us to provide collateral to wholesale counterparties related to the difference between current prices and the agreed upon fixed prices 
these collateral requirements can place significant demands on our cash flows or borrowing arrangements 
price volatility can cause collateral requirements to change quickly and significantly 
regulators may not grant rates that provide timely or sufficient recovery of our costs or allow a reasonable rate of return for our shareholders 
we have experienced higher costs for utility operations in each of the last several years 
we have also made significant capital investments into utility plant assets 
our ability to recover these costs depends on the amount and timeliness of retail rate changes allowed by regulatory agencies 
we expect to periodically file for rate increases with regulatory agencies to recover our costs and provide an opportunity to earn a reasonable return for shareholders 
if regulators grant substantially lower rate increases than our requests in the future  it could have a negative effect on our operating revenues  net income and cash flows 
deferred power and natural gas costs are subject to regulatory review  costs higher than those recovered in base rates reduce cash flows 
we defer income statement recognition and recovery from customers of certain power and natural gas costs that are higher than what is currently authorized by regulators 
these power and natural gas costs are recorded as deferred charges with the opportunity for future recovery through retail rates 
these deferred costs are subject to review for prudence and potential disallowance by regulators 
despite the opportunity to recover deferred power and natural gas costs  our operating cash flows are negatively affected until these costs are recovered from customers 
our energy resource management activities may cause volatility in our cash flows and results of operations 
we engage in active hedging and resource optimization practices  however  we cannot and do not attempt to fully hedge our energy resource assets or our forecasted net positions for various time horizons 
to reduce energy cost volatility and economic exposure related to commodity price fluctuations  we routinely enter into contracts to hedge a portion of our purchase and sale commitments for electricity and natural gas  as well as forecasted excess or deficit energy positions and inventories of natural gas 
we use physical energy contracts and derivative instruments  such as forwards  futures  swaps and options traded in the over the counter markets or on exchanges 
we do not cover the entire market price volatility exposure for our forecasted net positions 
to the extent we have positions that are not hedged  or if hedging positions do not fully match the corresponding purchase or sale  fluctuating commodity prices could have a material effect on our operating revenues  resource costs  derivative assets and liabilities  and operating cash flows 
in addition  actual loads and resources typically vary from forecasts  sometimes to a significant degree  which requires additional transactions or dispatch decisions that impact cash flows

we have significant capital requirements that we expect to fund  in part  by accessing capital markets 
as such  the state of financial markets and credit availability in the global  united states and regional economies could have an impact on our operations 
we could experience increased borrowing costs or limited access to capital on reasonable terms 
we need to access long term capital markets to finance capital expenditures  repay maturing long term debt and obtain additional working capital from time to time 
our ability to access capital on reasonable terms is subject to numerous factors and market conditions  many of which are beyond our control 
if we are unable to obtain capital on reasonable terms  it may limit or prohibit our ability to finance capital expenditures and repay maturing long term debt 
our liquidity needs could exceed our short term credit availability and lead to defaults on various financing arrangements 
we would also likely be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock 
performance of the financial markets could also result in significant declines in the market values of assets held by our pension plan which impacts the funded status of the plan and could increase future funding obligations and pension expense 
we rely on access to credit from financial institutions for short term borrowings 
we need to maintain access to adequate levels of credit with financial institutions for short term liquidity 
in february  we entered into a new million committed line of credit  which is scheduled to expire in february we cannot guarantee that we will have access to credit beyond the expiration date 
the line of credit agreements contain customary covenants and default provisions 
in the event of default  it would be difficult for us to obtain financing on reasonable terms to pay creditors or fund operations 
we would also likely be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock 
downgrades in our credit ratings could limit our ability to obtain financing  adversely affect the terms of financing and impact our ability to transact for or hedge energy resources 
if we do not maintain our investment grade credit rating with the major credit rating agencies  we could expect increased debt service costs  limitations on our ability to access capital markets or obtain other financing on reasonable terms  and requirements to provide collateral in the form of cash or letters of credit to lenders and counterparties 
in addition  credit rating downgrades could reduce the number of counterparties willing to do business with us 
we are subject to various operational and event risks that are common to the utility industry 
our utility operations are subject to operational and event risks that include blackouts or disruptions to distribution  transmission or transportation systems  forced outages at generating plants  fuel cost and availability  including delivery constraints  cyber security attacks or other disruptions to our information systems and other administrative resources required for normal operations  explosions  fires  accidents  or mechanical breakdowns that may occur while operating and maintaining our generation  transmission and distribution systems  natural disasters that can disrupt energy generation  transmission and distribution  and terrorism and other malicious threats 
as protection against operational and event risks  we maintain insurance coverage against some  but not all  potential losses and we seek to negotiate indemnification arrangements with contractors for certain event risks 
however  insurance or indemnification agreements may not be adequate to protect us against liability from all of the operational and event risks described above 
in addition  we are subject to the risk that insurers and or other parties will dispute or be unable to perform their obligations to us 
we are currently the subject of several regulatory proceedings  and we are named in multiple lawsuits related to our participation in western energy markets 
through our utility operations and the prior operations of avista energy  we are involved in a number of legal and regulatory proceedings and complaints related to energy markets in the western united states 
most of these proceedings and complaints relate to the significant increase in the spot market price of energy in and this allegedly contributed to or caused unjust and unreasonable prices 
these proceedings and complaints include  but are not limited to refund proceedings in california and the pacific northwest  market conduct investigations by the ferc  and complaints filed by various parties related to alleged misconduct by parties in western power markets 

table of contents avista corporation as a result of these proceedings and complaints  certain parties have asserted claims for significant refunds and damages from us  which could result in a negative effect on our results of operations and cash flows 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
any potential refunds or obligations arising from western energy market issues or any other contingent matters were retained by avista energy as part of its asset sale agreement in june we are subject to legislation and related administrative rulemaking  including periodic audits of compliance with such rules  which may adversely affect our operational and financial performance 
we expect to continue to be affected by legislation at the national  state and local level  as well as by administrative rules and requirements published by government agencies  including but not limited to the ferc and the epa 
we are also subject to nerc and wecc reliability standards 
the ferc  the nerc and the wecc may perform periodic audits of the company 
failure to comply with the ferc  the nerc  or the wecc requirements can result in financial penalties of up to million per day per violation 
future legislation or administrative rules could have a material adverse effect on our operations  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
concerns over long term global climate changes may affect our operational and financial performance 
legislative developments and advocacy at the state  national and international levels about climate change and other environmental concerns may have significant impacts on our operations 
the electric utility industry is one of the largest and most immediate industries to be more heavily regulated in some proposals 
for example  various legislative proposals have been made to limit or place further restrictions on byproducts of combustion  including sulfur dioxide  nitrogen oxide  carbon dioxide  and other greenhouse gases and mercury emissions 
such proposals  if adopted  could restrict the operation and raise the cost of our power generation resources 
we expect continuing activity in the future and we are evaluating the extent that potential changes to environmental laws and regulations may increase the operating costs of generating plants  increase the lead time and capital costs for the construction of new generating plants  require modification of our existing generating plants  require existing generating plant operations to be curtailed or shut down  reduce the amount of energy available from our generating plants  restrict the types of generating plants that can be built  and require construction of specific types of generation plants at higher cost 
we have contingent liabilities  including certain matters related to potential environmental liabilities  and cannot predict the outcome of these matters 
in the normal course of our business  we have matters that are the subject of ongoing litigation  mediation  investigation and or negotiation 
we cannot predict the ultimate outcome or potential impact of any particular issue  including the extent  if any  of insurance coverage or that amounts payable by us may be recoverable through the ratemaking process 
we are subject to environmental regulation by federal  state and local authorities related to our past  present and future operations 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details of these matters including a potential liability related to alleged contamination from the holding ponds at colstrip in montana  waste oil delivered to the harbor oil  inc site in portland  oregon  and aluminum dross located on a parcel of land we own near the spokane river

table of contents avista corporation item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business segments we have two reportable business segments as follows avista utilities an operating division of avista corp 
that comprises our regulated utility operations 
avista utilities generates  transmits and distributes electricity and distributes natural gas 
the utility also engages in wholesale purchases and sales of electricity and natural gas 
advantage iq an indirect subsidiary of avista corp 
approximately percent owned as of december  provides energy efficiency and cost management programs and services for multi site customers and utilities throughout north america 
advantage iq s primary product lines include expense management services for utility  telecom and lease needs as well as strategic energy management and efficiency services that include procurement  conservation  performance reporting  financial planning and energy efficiency program management for commercial enterprises and utilities 
we have other businesses  including sheet metal fabrication  venture fund investments and real estate investments  spokane energy which was consolidated effective january  as well as certain natural gas storage facilities held by avista energy 
these activities do not represent a reportable business segment and are conducted by various direct and indirect subsidiaries of avista corp  including am d  doing business as metalfx 
the following table presents net income loss attributable to avista corporation for each of our business segments and the other businesses for the year ended december dollars in thousands avista utilities advantage iq other net income attributable to avista corporation executive level summary overall net income attributable to avista corporation was million for  an increase from million for this was primarily due to an increase in earnings at advantage iq and a decrease in the net loss from the other businesses 
earnings at avista utilities were positively impacted by general rate increases  offset by warmer weather in the heating season and an increase in interest expense  other operating expenses and depreciation and amortization 
avista utilities avista utilities is our most significant business segment 
our utility operating and financial performance is dependent upon  among other things weather conditions  regulatory decisions  allowing our utility to recover costs  including purchased power and fuel costs  on a timely basis  and to earn a reasonable return on investment  the price of natural gas in the wholesale market  including the effect on the price of fuel for generation  the price of electricity in the wholesale market  including the effects of weather conditions  natural gas prices and other factors affecting supply and demand  and the ability to obtain financing through the issuance of debt and or equity securities  which can be affected by various factors including our credit ratings  interest rates and other capital market conditions 
in our utility operations  we continue to execute our regulatory strategy to regularly review the need for rate changes in each jurisdiction to improve the recovery of costs and capital investments in our generation  transmission and distribution infrastructure 
we filed general rate increase requests in each of our jurisdictions in general rate increases went into effect in idaho on october  and in washington effective january  and december  in february  we reached an all party settlement in oregon for a general rate increase that is subject to approval by the opuc 
our utility net income was million for and earnings for were positively impacted by an increase in gross margin operating revenues less resource costs 
the increase in gross margin was primarily due to general rate increases and power supply costs below the amount included in base retail rates in washington  partially offset by lower retail loads particularly for natural gas caused by warmer weather during the heating season 
the increase in gross margin was offset by an increase in interest expense  other operating expenses and depreciation and amortization 

table of contents avista corporation we are continuing to invest in generation  transmission and distribution systems to enhance service reliability for our customers and replace aging infrastructure 
utility capital expenditures were million for we expect utility capital expenditures to be about million for these estimates of capital expenditures are subject to continuing review and adjustment see discussion at avista utilities capital expenditures 
advantage iq advantage iq had net income attributable to avista corporation of million for  an increase from million for the increase was primarily due to moderate growth from expense management and energy management services coupled with the acquisition of ecos consulting  inc ecos effective august  advantage iq s earnings potential continues to be moderated by low short term interest rates  which limits interest revenue on funds held for customers 
on december   advantage iq acquired substantially all of the assets and liabilities of the loyalton group  a minneapolis based energy management firm known for its energy procurement and price risk management solutions 
the acquisition of the loyalton group was funded through available cash at advantage iq 
in january  advantage iq acquired substantially all of the assets and liabilities of building knowledge networks  a seattle based real time building energy management services provider 
the acquisition of building knowledge networks was funded through available cash at advantage iq 
effective july   advantage iq acquired cadence network  a cincinnati  ohio based energy and expense management company 
as consideration  the owners of cadence network received a percent ownership interest in advantage iq through the issuance of advantage iq common stock 
the previous owners of cadence network can exercise a right to have their shares of advantage iq stock redeemed by advantage iq during july or july if advantage iq is not liquidated through either an initial public offering or sale of the business to a third party 
their redemption rights expire july  the redemption price would be determined based on the fair market value of advantage iq at the time of the redemption election as determined by certain independent parties 
as of december   there were redeemable noncontrolling interests of million related to these redemption rights 
should the previous owners of cadence network exercise their redemption rights  advantage iq will seek the necessary funding through its credit facility  a capital request from existing owners  an infusion of capital from potential new investors or a combination of these sources 
in january  the other owners of advantage iq including avista capital purchased shares held by the one of the previous owners of cadence network that owned percent of advantage iq 
avista capital s portion of the purchase was million 
we may seek to monetize all or part of our investment in advantage iq in the future  regardless of whether advantage iq s minority owner redemption rights are exercised 
the value of a potential monetization depends on future market conditions  growth of the business and other factors 
this may provide access to public market capital and provide potential liquidity to avista corp 
and the other owners of advantage iq 
there can be no assurance that such a transaction will be completed 
other businesses the net loss for these operations was million for compared to a net loss of million for the improvement in results was due in part to increased earnings at metalfx and reduced litigation costs related to the remaining contracts and previous operations of avista energy 
in  we recorded a million impairment of our investment in a fuel cell business that was previously a subsidiary of the company 
also  in we recorded a million impairment of a commercial building 
liquidity and capital resources we need to access long term capital markets from time to time to finance capital expenditures  repay maturing long term debt and obtain additional working capital 
our ability to access capital on reasonable terms is subject to numerous factors  many of which  including market conditions  are beyond our control 
if we are unable to obtain capital on reasonable terms  it may limit or eliminate our ability to finance capital expenditures and repay maturing long term debt 
our liquidity needs could exceed our short term credit availability and lead to defaults on various financing arrangements 
we would also likely be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock 
at december   we had a committed line of credit in the total amount of million with an expiration date of april  under which there were million of cash borrowings and million in letters of credit outstanding 
we also had a committed line of credit in the total amount of million with an expiration date of april  under which there were no borrowings outstanding as of december  as of december   we had a combined million of available liquidity under our million and million committed lines of credit

in accordance with regulatory accounting practices  the make whole redemption premium will be amortized over the life of the new debt issued 
also in december  we issued million of percent first mortgage bonds due in the net proceeds from the issuance of the bonds of million net of placement agent fees and before our expenses were used to repay a portion of the borrowings outstanding under our committed line of credit 
we are planning  subject to market conditions  to cause the redemption of million of pollution control bonds and the refunding thereof with new bond issues in we are currently the holder of all bonds to be redeemed and refunded and  accordingly  would receive the redemption proceeds 
we are party to a sales agency agreement under which we sell shares of our common stock from time to time 
in  we sold million shares for a total of million 
as of december   we had million shares available to be issued under this agreement 
we expect to issue up to million of common stock in in order to maintain our capital structure at an appropriate level for our business 
after considering the issuances of common stock during  we expect net cash flows from operating activities  together with cash available under our new million committed line of credit agreement to provide adequate resources to fund capital expenditures  dividends  and other contractual commitments 
avista utilities regulatory matters general rate cases we regularly review the need for electric and natural gas rate changes in each state in which we provide service 
we will continue to file for rate adjustments to provide for recovery of operating costs and capital investments  and move our earned returns closer to those allowed by regulators 
with regards to the timing and plans for future filings  the assessment of our need for rate relief and the development of rate case plans takes into consideration short term and long term needs  as well as specific factors that can affect the timing of rate filings

power cost deferrals and recovery mechanisms the energy recovery mechanism erm is an accounting method used to track certain differences between actual power supply costs  net of the margin on wholesale sales and sales of fuel  and the amount included in base retail rates for our washington customers 
in the washington general rate case settlement  the parties agreed that there would be no deferrals under the erm 
deferrals under the erm will resume in in periods where we are a net seller of wholesale power  market prices lower than the prices included in rates negatively impact the erm 
in periods where we are a net purchaser  market prices lower than the amount included in retail rates have a beneficial impact under the erm 
this difference in net power supply costs primarily results from changes in short term wholesale market prices and sales and purchase volumes  the level of hydroelectric generation  the level of thermal generation including changes in fuel prices  and retail loads 

table of contents avista corporation under the erm  we absorb the cost or receive the benefit from the initial amount of power supply costs in excess of or below the level in retail rates  which is referred to as the deadband 
the annual calendar year deadband amount is currently million 
we incur the cost of  or receive the benefit from  percent of this initial power supply cost variance 
we share annual power supply cost variances between million and million with customers 
there is a percent customers percent company sharing when actual power supply expenses are higher surcharge to customers than the amount included in base retail rates within this band 
there is a percent customers percent company sharing when actual power supply expenses are lower rebate to customers than the amount included in base retail rates within this band 
to the extent that the annual power supply cost variance from the amount included in base rates exceeds million  percent of the cost variance is deferred for future surcharge or rebate 
we absorb into power supply costs the remaining percent of the annual variance beyond million 
the following is a summary of the erm annual power supply cost variability deferred for future surcharge or rebate to customers expense or benefit to the company million between million million between million million excess over million under the erm  we make an annual filing on or before april of each year to provide the opportunity for the wutc staff and other interested parties to review the prudence of and audit the erm deferred power cost transactions for the prior calendar year 
the erm provides for a day review period for the filing  however  the period may be extended by agreement of the parties or by wutc order 
additionally  we must make a filing no sooner than june  to allow all interested parties the opportunity to review the erm  and make recommendations to the wutc related to the continuation  modification or elimination of the erm 
in february  the wutc approved our request to eliminate the erm surcharge 
the surcharge was eliminated as the previous balance of deferred power costs was recovered 
this resulted in a rate reduction of percent for our washington customers with no impact on our income from operations or net income 
we have a power cost adjustment pca mechanism in idaho that allows us to modify electric rates on october of each year with ipuc approval 
under the pca mechanism  we defer percent of the difference between certain actual net power supply expenses and the amount included in base retail rates for our idaho customers 
the october rate adjustments recover or rebate power costs deferred during the preceding july june twelve month period 
the pca rate surcharge was cents per kwh for the period october  through september  however  the surcharge rate was lowered to cents per kwh on august  to help mitigate the impact of the general rate increase that was also effective on that date

table of contents avista corporation regulations have been proposed to require automatic shut off valves on pipeline mains  increase installation of excess flow valves on gas service piping  increase high consequence area boundaries as well as to provide additional scrutiny on existing emergency preparedness plans  quality assurance plans and damage prevention programs and broader federal oversight including broader use of fines and penalties to pipeline operators 
in addition  the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration issued an advisory bulletin on january  to remind operators of gas and hazardous liquid pipeline facilities of their responsibilities  under federal integrity management regulations  to perform detailed threat and risk analyses especially with regards to their pipelines maximum allowable operating pressures 
while we believe that we operate our pipeline systems in a safe manner  we cannot predict the impact of any future regulations or inspections of our natural gas system 
results of operations the following provides an overview of changes in our consolidated statements of income 
more detailed explanations are provided  particularly for operating revenues and operating expenses  in the business segment discussions avista utilities  advantage iq and the other businesses that follow this section 
compared to utility revenues increased million due to increased electric revenues of million  partially offset by decreased natural gas revenues of million and intracompany revenues of million 
wholesale electric revenues increased million primarily due to an increase in volumes and partially due to an increase in wholesale prices and sales of fuel increased million reflecting increased thermal generation resource optimization 
these increases in electric revenues were partially offset by a decrease in retail electric revenues of million  due to a decrease in volumes and prices resulting from the elimination of the erm surcharge  offset by general rate increases 
retail natural gas revenues decreased million due to decreased retail rates and decreased volumes  while wholesale natural gas revenues increased million due to increased volumes and wholesale prices 
non utility energy revenues decreased million to million 
these revenues for primarily represent revenues for spokane energy which was consolidated effective january  related to a long term electric capacity contract 
these revenues for primarily represent payments for the power purchase agreement for the lancaster plant 
the majority of the rights and obligations of this agreement were conveyed to shell energy through the end of these rights and obligations were conveyed to avista utilities operations in january other non utility revenues increased million to million primarily as a result of an advantage iq s revenues increasing million primarily due to the acquisition of ecos in the third quarter of  as well as moderate growth in expense management and energy management services 
revenues from our other businesses increased million  primarily due to increased sales at metalfx 
utility resource costs decreased million as natural gas resource costs decreased million and intracompany resource costs decreased million  while electric resource costs increased million 
the decrease in natural gas resource costs primarily reflects the purchased gas cost adjustments implemented in the fourth quarter of the increase in electric resource costs was primarily due to an increase in fuel costs due to an increase in thermal generation and other fuel costs reflecting an increase in thermal generation optimization activities 
utility other operating expenses increased million primarily due to increased outside services primarily consulting costs of million  compensation costs of million  as well as injuries and damages of million

the increase was partially offset by decreased operating expenses from the other businesses due to an impairment of a commercial building of million in 
table of contents avista corporation interest expense increased million primarily due to the consolidation of spokane energy increased interest expense million and the issuance of million of long term debt in september during  we carried relatively high balances on our committed line of credit at relatively low interest rates 
this was replaced with long term debt at a higher interest rate 
interest expense to affiliated trusts decreased million because of the redemption of million of long term debt to affiliated trusts in april and a decrease in the variable interest rate on the remaining debt outstanding 
other expense net increased million primarily due to an increase in donations  a decrease in interest income primarily interest on regulatory deferrals due to lower balances and a million impairment of our investment in a fuel cell business that was previously a subsidiary of the company 
income taxes increased million and our effective tax rate was percent for compared to percent for this increase was due in part to an increase in income before income taxes 
adjustments associated with reconciling the federal income tax return to the amount included in the financial statements for and prior year income tax return amendments decreased income tax expense by million for recorded in the third quarter 
in  we recorded adjustments related to internal revenue service irs audits and adjustments for the filed federal tax return that had a favorable impact to income tax expense of million avista utilities for recorded in the third quarter 
compared to utility revenues decreased million to  million due to decreased natural gas revenues of million  partially offset by increased electric revenues of million 
wholesale natural gas revenues decreased million due to decreased prices  offset by increased volumes and retail natural gas revenues decreased million primarily due to decreased prices and partially due to decreased volumes 
retail electric revenues increased million primarily due to the washington general rate increase implemented on january  and the idaho general rate increases implemented on october  and august   while wholesale electric revenues decreased million due to a decrease in prices  partially offset by an increase in volumes and sales of fuel decreased million 
non utility energy marketing and trading revenues decreased million to million 
these revenues primarily represent payments for the power purchase agreement for the lancaster plant 
the majority of the rights and obligations of this agreement were conveyed to shell energy through the end of these rights and obligations were conveyed to our utility operations in january other non utility revenues increased million to million as a result of an increase in revenues from advantage iq of million primarily due to the acquisition of cadence network in the third quarter of and ecos in the third quarter of  as well as other customer billing services 
these increases in revenues from advantage iq were partially offset by a decrease in interest earnings on funds held for customers due to lower interest rates 
the increase in revenues at advantage iq was partially offset by decreased revenues from our other businesses of million  primarily due to decreased sales at metalfx 
utility resource costs decreased million due to decreases in natural gas resource costs of million and electric resource costs of million 
the decrease in natural gas resource costs primarily reflects a decrease in the price of natural gas purchases 
the decrease in electric resource costs was primarily due to a decrease in fuel costs due to a decrease in thermal generation and natural gas fuel prices 
utility other operating expenses increased million primarily due to an million increase in electric generation operating and maintenance expenses  a million increase in natural gas distribution and service costs  as well as a million increase in pension and other benefit costs

table of contents avista corporation the net change in other non utility operating expenses was an increase of million due to an increase of million for advantage iq primarily due to the acquisition of cadence network in the third quarter of and the acquisition of ecos in the third quarter of the increase was also partially due to an impairment of a commercial building of million in the other businesses 
these increases were partially offset by decreased operating expenses from metalfx 
interest expense decreased million due to the effect of long term debt maturities and redemptions during  which were funded primarily with proceeds from the issuance of long term debt as well as borrowings under our committed line of credit at lower interest rates 
the decrease was also partially due to interest expense of million related to an income tax settlement recorded in the third quarter of interest expense to affiliated trusts decreased million due to the redemption of million of long term debt due to affiliated trusts in april and a decrease in the variable interest rate 
capitalized interest decreased million primarily due to a decrease in the effective borrowing rate used to compute capitalized interest  as the average balance outstanding under our committed line of credit was significantly higher in as compared to other income net decreased million due to a decrease in interest income primarily due to million of interest income recorded on the irs settlement agreement in the third quarter of 
the decrease was also due to a decrease in equity related afudc 
income taxes increased million and our effective tax rate was percent for compared to percent for the decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to adjustments related to irs audits and adjustments for the filed federal tax return 
in total  these adjustments recorded in the third quarter of had a favorable impact to recorded income tax expense of million avista utilities 
avista utilities compared to net income for avista utilities was million for and avista utilities income from operations was million for compared to million for the increase in income from operations was primarily due to an increase in gross margin operating revenues less resource costs and a decrease in taxes other than income taxes  partially offset by an increase in other operating expenses and depreciation and amortization 
the following table presents our operating revenues  resource costs and resulting gross margin for the year ended december dollars in thousands electric natural gas intracompany total operating revenues resource costs gross margin avista utilities operating revenues increased million and resource costs decreased million  which resulted in an increase of million in gross margin 
the gross margin on electric sales increased million and the gross margin on natural gas sales decreased million 
the increase in electric gross margin was due to general rate increases and power supply costs below the amount included in base retail rates in washington  partially offset by warmer weather during the heating season that reduced retail loads 
the decrease in our natural gas gross margin was primarily due to warmer weather that reduced retail loads  partially offset by general rate increases 
intracompany revenues and resource costs represent purchases and sales of natural gas between our natural gas distribution operations and our electric generation operations as fuel for our generation plants 
the magnitude of these transactions in prior years was immaterial  but increased significantly in with the addition of the natural gas fired lancaster plant to our electric resource mix

compared to  residential electric use per customer was down percent and commercial use per customer decreased percent 
the decrease in revenue per mwh was primarily due to the elimination of the erm surcharge in february  partially offset by the washington and idaho general rate increases 
the decrease in revenue per mwh was also due to a greater percentage of revenue derived from industrial customers 
wholesale electric revenues increased million due to an increase in sales prices increased revenues million and an increase in sales volumes increased revenues million 
the increase in sales volumes primarily related to increased resource optimization activities and lower than expected retail sales 
when electric wholesale market prices are below the cost of operating our natural gas fired thermal generating units  we sell the natural gas purchased for generation in the wholesale market as sales of fuel 
sales of fuel increased million due to an increase in thermal generation resource optimization activities in as compared to in  million of these sales were made to our natural gas operations and are reflected as intracompany revenues and resource costs

the increase in volumes was primarily due to purchasing power to cover for below normal hydroelectric generation  the purchased power agreement for the lancaster plant and an increase in wholesale sales volumes related to optimization 
net amortization of deferred of power costs was million for compared million for during  we recovered collected as revenue million of previously deferred power costs in washington and million in idaho 
the washington erm surcharge was eliminated in february  since the previous balance of deferred power costs had been recovered 
during  we deferred million of power costs in idaho  as power supply costs exceeded the amount included in base retail rates 
in washington  we deferred million of costs included in other regulatory assets associated with the lancaster project 
this was the maximum deferral for as agreed to in the washington general rate case settlement 
in that settlement  the parties agreed that there would not be any deferrals under the erm for the net effect of the settlement for the lancaster plant deferrals and the erm was slightly positive to earnings 
fuel for generation increased million primarily due to an increase in thermal generation  including fuel for the lancaster plant 
in  we experienced an outage at colstrip  which reduced thermal generation 
other fuel costs increased million 
this represents fuel that was purchased for generation but was later sold when conditions indicated that it was not economical to use the fuel for generation as part of the resource optimization process 
the associated revenues are reflected as sales of fuel 
the expense for natural gas purchased decreased million due to a decrease in the price of natural gas decreased costs million  partially offset by an increase in the total therms purchased increased costs million 
total therms purchased increased due to wholesale sales with the balancing of loads and resources as part of the natural gas procurement process  partially offset by decreased retail sales volumes 
we engage in optimization of available interstate pipeline transportation and storage capacity through wholesale purchases and sales of natural gas 
during  natural gas resource costs were reduced by million reflecting the rebate of a deferred liability for natural gas costs through the purchased gas adjustments implemented in november 
table of contents avista corporation compared to net income for the utility was million for compared to million for utility income from operations was million for compared to million for this increase in income from operations was primarily due to increased gross margin operating revenues less resource costs

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
changes in these estimates and assumptions are considered reasonably possible and may have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements and thus actual results could differ from the amounts reported and disclosed herein 
the following accounting policies represent those that our management believes are particularly important to the consolidated financial statements that require the use of estimates and assumptions avista utilities operating revenues operating revenues for our utility related to the sale of energy are generally recorded when service is rendered or energy is delivered to our customers 
the determination of energy sales to individual customers is based on the reading of their meters  which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month 
at the end of each calendar month  we estimate the amount of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last meter reading and the corresponding unbilled revenue is estimated and recorded 
our estimate of unbilled revenue is based on the number of customers  current rates  meter reading dates  actual native load for electricity  and actual throughput for natural gas 
any difference between actual and estimated revenue is automatically corrected in the following month when the actual meter reading and customer billing occurs 
regulatory accounting we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with regulatory accounting practices 
this requires that certain costs and or obligations such as incurred power and natural gas costs not currently recovered through rates  but expected to be recovered in the future be reflected as deferred charges on our consolidated balance sheets and are not reflected in our consolidated statements of income until the period during which matching revenues are recognized 
we expect to recover our regulatory assets through future rates 
our regulatory assets are subject to review for prudence and recoverability 
as such  certain deferred costs may be disallowed by our regulators 
if at some point in the future we determine that we no longer meet the criteria for continued application of regulatory accounting for all or a portion of our regulated operations  we could be required to write off regulatory assets  and precluded from the future deferral of costs not recovered through rates when such costs are incurred  even if we expect to recover such costs in the future 
utility energy commodity derivative assets and liabilities our utility enters into forward contracts to purchase or sell a specified amount of energy at a specified time  or during a specified period  in the future 
these contracts are entered into as part of our management of loads and resources and certain contracts are considered derivative instruments 
the wutc and the ipuc issued accounting orders authorizing us to offset commodity derivative assets or liabilities with a regulatory asset or liability 
this accounting treatment is intended to defer the recognition of mark to market gains and losses on energy commodity transactions until the period of settlement 
the orders provide for us to not recognize the unrealized gain or loss on utility derivative commodity instruments in the consolidated statements of income 
realized gains or losses are 
table of contents avista corporation recognized in the period of settlement  subject to approval for recovery through retail rates 
realized gains and losses  subject to regulatory approval  result in adjustments to retail rates through purchased gas cost adjustments  the erm in washington  the pca mechanism in idaho  and periodic general rates cases 
we use quoted market prices and forward price curves to estimate the fair value of our utility derivative commodity instruments 
as such  the fair value of utility derivative commodity instruments recorded on our consolidated balance sheets is sensitive to market price fluctuations that can occur on a daily basis 
pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans we have a defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all regular full time employees at avista utilities 
our finance committee of the board of directors establishes investment policies  objectives and strategies that seek an appropriate return for the pension plan  and reviews and approves changes to the investment and funding policies 
we have contracted with an investment consultant who is responsible for managing monitoring the individual investment managers 
the investment managers performance and related individual fund performance is reviewed at least quarterly by an internal benefits committee and by the finance committee to monitor compliance with our established investment policy objectives and strategies 
our pension plan assets are invested primarily in marketable debt and equity securities 
pension plan assets may also be invested in real estate  absolute return  venture capital private equity and commodity funds 
in seeking to obtain the desired return to fund the pension plan  the investment consultant recommends allocation percentages by asset classes 
these recommendations are reviewed by the internal benefits committee  which then recommends their adoption by the finance committee 
the finance committee has established investment allocation percentages by asset classes as disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we also have a supplemental executive retirement plan serp that provides additional pension benefits to our executive officers whose benefits under the pension plan are reduced due to the application of section of the internal revenue code of and the deferral of salary under deferred compensation plans 
pension costs including the serp were million for  million for and million for of our pension costs  approximately percent are expensed and percent are capitalized consistent with labor charges 
the costs related to the serp are expensed 
our costs for the pension plan are determined in part by actuarial formulas that are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience 
pension costs are affected by employee demographics including age  compensation and length of service by employees  the amount of cash contributions we make to the pension plan  and the return on pension plan assets 
changes made to the provisions of our pension plan may also affect current and future pension costs 
pension plan costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions  including the expected return on pension plan assets  discount rate used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs  and assumed rate of increase in employee compensation 
the change in pension plan obligations associated with these factors may not be immediately recognized as pension costs in our consolidated statement of income  but we generally recognize the change in future years over the remaining average service period of pension plan participants 
as such  our costs recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of cash benefits provided to pension plan participants 
in  the company reviewed the mortality table utilized in the actuarial calculations 
the company determined that the rp combined healthy mortality tables for males and females should be replaced with the rp combined healthy mortality tables for males and females projected to using scale aa 
the change resulted in an increase of million to the pension benefit obligation as of december  we have not made any changes to pension plan provisions in  and that have had any significant effect on our recorded pension plan amounts 
we have revised the key assumption of the discount rate in  and such changes had an effect on our pension costs in  and and may affect future years  given the cost recognition approach described above 
however  in determining pension obligation and cost amounts  our assumptions can change from period to period  and such changes could result in material changes to our future pension costs and funding requirements 

table of contents avista corporation in selecting a discount rate  we consider yield rates for highly rated corporate bond portfolios with maturities similar to that of the expected term of pension benefits 
in  we decreased the pension plan discount rate to percent from percent in we used a discount rate of percent in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is based on past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by our plan 
we used an expected long term rate of return of percent in  a decrease from percent used in and this increased pension costs in by approximately million 
the actual return on plan assets  net of fees  was a gain of million or percent for  a gain of million or percent for and a loss of million or percent for we periodically analyze the estimated long term rate of return on assets based upon revisions to the investment portfolio 
the following chart reflects the sensitivities associated with a change in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage dollars in thousands actuarial assumption change in assumption effect on projected benefit obligation effect on pension cost expected long term return on plan assets expected long term return on plan assets discount rate discount rate changes in the expected return on plan assets would not have an effect on our total pension liability 
we provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for substantially all of our retired employees 
we accrue the estimated cost of postretirement benefit obligations during the years that employees provide service 
assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for our postretirement plans 
a one percentage point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate for each year would increase our accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december  by million and the service and interest cost by million 
a one percentage point decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate for each year would decrease our accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december  by million and the service and interest cost by million 
stock based compensation we recognize compensation costs relating to share based payment transactions in our consolidated statements of income based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
the fair value of each performance share award was estimated on the date of grant using a statistical model that incorporates the probability of meeting performance targets based on historical returns relative to a peer group 
expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our common stock over a three year period 
the expected term of the performance shares is three years based on the performance cycle 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield at the time of grant 
contingencies we have unresolved regulatory  legal and tax issues for which there is inherent uncertainty for the ultimate outcome of the respective matter 
we accrue a loss contingency if it is probable that an asset is impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss or impairment can be reasonably estimated 
we also disclose losses that do not meet these conditions for accrual  if there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred 
for all material contingencies  we have made a judgment as to the probability of a loss occurring and as to whether or not the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
if the loss recognition criteria are met  liabilities are accrued or assets are reduced 
however  no assurance can be given to the ultimate outcome of any particular contingency

table of contents avista corporation overall liquidity our consolidated operating cash flows are primarily derived from the operations of avista utilities 
the primary source of operating cash flows for our utility operations is revenues from sales of electricity and natural gas 
significant uses of cash flows from our utility operations include the purchase of power  fuel and natural gas  and payment of other operating expenses  taxes and interest  with any excess being available for other corporate uses such as capital expenditures and dividends 
we design operating and capital budgets to control operating costs and optimize capital expenditures  particularly for our regulated utility operations 
in addition to operating expenses  we have continuing commitments for capital expenditures for construction  improvement and maintenance of utility facilities 
over time  our operating cash flows usually do not fully support the amount required for utility capital expenditures 
as such  from time to time  we need to access capital markets in order to fund these needs as well as fund maturing debt 
see further discussion at capital resources 
we periodically file for rate adjustments for recovery of operating costs and capital investments to provide the opportunity to move our earned returns closer to those allowed by regulators 
see further details in the section avista utilities regulatory matters 
for our utility operations  when power and natural gas costs exceed the levels currently recovered from retail customers  net cash flows are negatively affected 
factors that could cause purchased power and natural gas costs to exceed the levels currently recovered from our customers include  but are not limited to  higher prices in wholesale markets when we buy energy or an increased need to purchase power in the wholesale markets 
factors beyond our control that could result in an increased need to purchase power in the wholesale markets include  but are not limited to increases in demand either due to weather or customer growth  low availability of streamflows for hydroelectric generation  unplanned outages at generating facilities  and failure of third parties to deliver on energy or capacity contracts 
we monitor the potential liquidity impacts of increasing energy commodity prices and other increased operating costs for our utility operations 
we believe that we have adequate liquidity to meet the increased cash needs of higher energy commodity prices and other increased operating costs through our new million committed line of credit 
as of december   we had a combined million of available liquidity under our committed lines of credit 
as we have secured a new million credit facility with an expiration date of february  we believe that we have adequate liquidity to meet our needs for the next months 
our utility has regulatory mechanisms in place that provide for the deferral and recovery of the majority of power and natural gas supply costs 
however  if prices rise above the level currently allowed in retail rates in periods when we are buying energy  deferral balances will increase  which will negatively affect our cash flow and liquidity until such costs  with interest  are recovered from customers 
credit and nonperformance risk our contracts for the purchase and sale of energy commodities can require collateral in the form of cash or letters of credit 
adverse price movements and or a downgrade in our credit ratings may impact further the amount of collateral required 
see credit ratings for further information 
for example  in addition to limiting our ability to conduct transactions  if our credit ratings were lowered to below investment grade and energy prices decreased by percent in the first year and percent in subsequent years  we estimate  based on our positions outstanding at december   that we would potentially be required to post additional collateral up to million 
the additional collateral amount is higher than the amount disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements because this analysis includes contracts that are not considered derivatives and due to the assumptions about potential energy price changes 
under the terms of interest rate swap agreements that we enter into periodically  we may be required to post cash collateral depending on fluctuations in the fair value of the instrument 
this has not historically been significant to our liquidity position 
as of december   we had two interest rate swap agreements outstanding with a notional amount totaling million and a mandatory cash settlement date of july we have not posted any collateral under these interest rate swap agreements 

table of contents avista corporation dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank act was signed into law by president obama on july  the dodd frank act establishes regulatory jurisdiction by the commodity futures trading commission cftc and the securities and exchange commission sec for certain swaps which include a variety of derivative instruments and the users of such swaps  that otherwise would have been exempted under the commodity exchange dodd frank act  federal securities laws and federal banking laws 
a variety of rules must be adopted by federal agencies including the cftc  sec and the ferc to implement the dodd frank act 
these rules  which will be developed and implemented over timeframes as defined in the dodd frank act  could have a significant impact on avista corp 
that was not clearly defined in the act itself 
under the dodd frank act  swap dealers and major swap participants will be required to post collateral to meet minimum capital requirements as well as minimum initial and variation margin requirements  the purpose of which is to ensure the safety and soundness of the capital markets by addressing concerns brought about by the global financial crisis of and swap dealers and or major swap participants are persons who serve as dealers in swaps or who maintain a substantial position in swaps  for reasons other than mitigating commercial risk 
the dodd frank act also requires a broad category of swaps to be cleared and traded on registered exchanges or special derivatives exchanges 
such clearing requirements would result in a significant change from our current practice of bilateral transactions and negotiated credit terms 
an exemption to such clearing requirements is outlined in the dodd frank act for end users that are not major swap participants or swap dealers and enter into hedges to mitigate commercial risk 
we expect to qualify under the end user exemption  however  concern remains that counterparties that are swap dealers or major swap participants will pass along the increased cost and margin requirements through higher prices and reductions in unsecured credit limits 
we will continue to monitor developments and cannot predict the impact the dodd frank act may ultimately have on our operations 
capital resources our consolidated capital structure  including the current portion of long term debt and short term borrowings  and excluding noncontrolling interests  consisted of the following as of december  and december  dollars in thousands december  december  amount percent of total amount percent of total current portion of long term debt current portion of nonrecourse long term debt short term borrowings long term debt to affiliated trusts nonrecourse long term debt long term debt total debt total avista corporation stockholders equity total nonrecourse long term debt including current portion represents the long term debt of spokane energy  which was consolidated effective january  to provide funding to acquire a long term fixed rate electric capacity contract from avista corp  spokane energy borrowed million from a funding trust in december the long term debt has scheduled monthly installments and interest at a fixed rate of percent with the final payment due in january spokane energy bears full recourse risk for the debt  which is secured by the electric capacity contract and million of funds held in a trust account 
we need to finance capital expenditures and obtain additional working capital from time to time 
the cash requirements needed to service our indebtedness  both short term and long term  reduces the amount of cash flow available to fund capital expenditures  working capital  purchased power  fuel and natural gas costs  dividends and other requirements 
our stockholders equity increased million during primarily due to net income and the issuance of common stock  partially offset by dividends 
we generally fund capital expenditures with a combination of internally generated cash and external financing 
the level of cash generated internally and the amount that is available for capital expenditures fluctuates depending on a variety of factors 
cash provided by our utility operating activities is expected to be the primary source of funds for operating needs  dividends and capital expenditures for borrowings under our new million committed line of credit will supplement these funds to the extent necessary 

table of contents avista corporation we are planning to issue up to million of common stock in in order to maintain our capital structure at an appropriate level for our business 
we are party to a sales agency agreement under which we sell shares of our common stock from time to time 
in we sold a total of million shares for a total of million 
as of december   we had million shares available to be issued under this agreement 
at december   we had a committed line of credit in the total amount of million with an expiration date of april additionally  at december   we had a committed line of credit in the total amount of million with an expiration date of april in february  we entered into a new committed line of credit in the total amount of million with an expiration date of february that replaced our million and million committed lines of credit 
our committed line of credit agreements contain customary covenants and default provisions 
the million and million credit agreements had a covenant that required the ratio of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization to interest expense of avista utilities for the preceding twelve month period at the end of any fiscal quarter to be greater than to as of december   we were in compliance with this covenant with a ratio of to the new million committed line of credit does not have this covenant 
the million and million committed line of credit agreements had a covenant which did not permit our ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated total capitalization to be greater than percent at any time 
as of december   we were in compliance with this covenant with a ratio of percent 
under the new million committed line of credit  this ratio must not be greater than percent at any time 
balances outstanding and interest rates of borrowings excluding letters of credit under our revolving committed lines of credit were as follows as of and for the years ended december dollars in thousands balance outstanding at end of period letters of credit outstanding at end of period maximum balance outstanding during the period average balance outstanding during the period average interest rate during the period average interest rate at end of period any default on the line of credit or other financing arrangements of avista corp 
or any of our significant subsidiaries could result in cross defaults to other agreements of such entity  and or to the line of credit or other financing arrangements of any other of such entities 
any defaults could also induce vendors and other counterparties to demand collateral 
in the event of any such default  it would be difficult for us to obtain financing on reasonable terms to pay creditors or fund operations 
we would also likely be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock 
avista corp 
does not guarantee the indebtedness of any of its subsidiaries 
as of december   avista corp 
and its subsidiaries were in compliance with all of the covenants of their financing agreements 
we are restricted under our restated articles of incorporation as to the additional preferred stock we can issue 
as of december   we could issue million of additional preferred stock at an assumed dividend rate of percent 
we are not planning to issue preferred stock 
under the mortgage and deed of trust securing our first mortgage bonds including secured medium term notes  we may issue additional first mortgage bonds in an aggregate principal amount equal to the sum of percent of the cost or fair value whichever is lower of property additions which have not previously been made the basis of any application under the mortgage  or an equal principal amount of retired first mortgage bonds which have not previously been made the basis of any application under the mortgage  or deposit of cash 
however  we may not issue any additional first mortgage bonds with certain exceptions in the case of bonds issued on the basis of retired bonds unless our net earnings as defined in the mortgage for any period of consecutive calendar months out of the preceding calendar months were at least twice the annual interest requirements on all mortgage securities at the time outstanding  including the first mortgage bonds to be issued  and on all indebtedness of prior rank 
as of december   our property additions and retired bonds would have allowed us to issue million in aggregate principal amount of additional first mortgage bonds 
however  using an interest rate of percent on additional first mortgage bonds  and based on net earnings for the months ended december   the net earnings test would limit the principal amount of additional bonds we could issue to million 
we believe that we have adequate capacity to issue first mortgage bonds to meet our financing needs over the next several years 

table of contents avista corporation avista utilities capital expenditures capital expenditures for our utility were million for the years through we expect utility capital expenditures to be million for  and between million and million for each of and the increase in capital expenditures from million in to million in is primarily due to hydroelectric generation plant upgrades  smart grid projects and a slight increase in customer growth 
our capital budget for includes the following dollars in millions transmission and distribution generation customer growth information technology smart grid natural gas environmental other total these estimates of capital expenditures are subject to continuing review and adjustment 
actual capital expenditures may vary from our estimates due to factors such as changes in business conditions  construction schedules and environmental requirements 
we applied to the smart grid investment grant program under the american recovery and reinvestment act the arra of  proposing a percent cost share for the deployment of smart grid enabling technologies in the spokane area 
in october  we were selected to negotiate a grant under this stimulus program 
the grant is for million and our contribution will be million  the majority of which will be spent over a three year period 
we finalized the grant agreement with the department of energy in march we applied with battelle northwest to participate in a smart grid demonstration project in pullman  washington under the arra 
in november  this project was selected by the department of energy for a grant 
the funding agreement was finalized in september the smart grid demonstration project will partner with other regional utilities and proposes a percent cost share for a group of projects 
our portion of the regional demonstration project is estimated to cost million  the majority of which will be spent over a three year period 
in february  we issued a request for proposals rfp seeking to acquire up to amw of renewable energy  or as much as mw of nameplate wind capacity with deliveries beginning in we completed the acquisition of the development rights for a wind generation site in while this rfp does not include the development of this site  we will continue to study this site in preparation for later development 
future generation resource decisions may be further impacted by legislation for restrictions on greenhouse gas ghg emissions and renewable energy requirements as discussed at environmental issues and other contingencies 
we are continuing our participation in planning activities for the development of a proposed  mw transmission project that would extend from british columbia  canada to northern california 
the project would be implemented in two sections  one from canada to northeastern oregon the northern section and then on into california the southern section 
western area power administration is leading the development on the southern section and is working with pacific gas and electric  transmission agency of northern california and others 
british columbia transmission corporation is leading the development effort on the northern section 
the participants have received a western electricity coordinating council wecc phase i rating for both sections of the project  and avista corp 
is working on a wecc phase ii rating for an interconnection from the project to the avista corp 
transmission system 
we have contributed million to the project to date with no additional funding anticipated in advantage iq credit agreement as of december   advantage iq had a million committed credit agreement with an expiration date of february that had no borrowings outstanding 
advantage iq may elect to increase the credit facility to million under the same agreement 
the credit agreement is secured by substantially all of advantage iq s assets

a security rating is not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold securities 
each security rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization 
each security rating agency has its own methodology for assigning ratings  and  accordingly  each rating should be considered in the context of the applicable methodology  independent of all other ratings 
the rating agencies provide ratings at the request of avista corporation and charge us fees for their services 
dividends the board of directors considers the level of dividends on our common stock on a regular basis  taking into account numerous factors including  without limitation our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition  the success of our business strategies  and general economic and competitive conditions 
our net income available for dividends is primarily derived from our regulated utility operations 
the payment of dividends on common stock is restricted by provisions of certain covenants applicable to preferred stock when outstanding contained in our restated articles of incorporation  as amended

these contractual obligations do not include income tax payments 
in addition to the contractual obligations disclosed above  we will incur additional operating costs and capital expenditures in future periods for which we are not contractually obligated as part of our normal business operations 
competition our utility electric and natural gas distribution business has historically been recognized as a natural monopoly 
in each regulatory jurisdiction  our rates for retail electric and natural gas services other than specially negotiated retail rates for industrial or large commercial customers  which are subject to regulatory review and approval are determined on a cost of service basis 
rates are designed to provide  after recovery of allowable operating expenses and capital investments  an opportunity for us to earn a reasonable return on investment as set by our regulators 
in retail markets  we compete with various rural electric cooperatives and public utility districts in and adjacent to our service territories in the provision of service to new electric customers 
alternate providers of energy may also compete with us for sales to existing customers 
similarly  our natural gas distribution operations compete with other energy sources including heating oil  propane and other fuels 
also  non utility businesses are developing new technologies and services to help energy consumers manage energy in new ways that may improve productivity and could alter demand for the energy we sell 
in wholesale markets  competition for available electric supply is influenced by the localized and system wide demand for energy  type  capacity  location and availability of generation resources  and variety and circumstances of market participants 
these wholesale markets are regulated by the ferc  which requires electric utilities to transmit power and energy to or for wholesale purchasers and sellers  enlarge or construct additional transmission capacity for the purpose of providing these services  and transparently price and offer transmission services without favor to any party  including the merchant functions of the utility 
participants in the wholesale energy markets include other utilities  federal power marketing agencies  energy marketing and trading companies  independent power producers  financial institutions  and commodity brokers 
advantage iq is subject to competition for service to existing customers and as they develop products and services and enter new markets 
competition from other companies may mean challenges for advantage iq to be the first to market a new product or service to gain an advantage in market share 
other challenges for advantage iq include the availability of funding and resources to meet capital needs  and rapidly advancing technologies which requires continual product enhancement to avoid obsolescence 
economic conditions and utility load growth the general economic data  on both national and local levels  contained in this section are based  in part  on independent government and industry publications  reports by market research firms or other independent sources 
while we believe that these publications and other sources are reliable  we have not independently verified such data and can make no representation as to its accuracy 

table of contents avista corporation economic growth in the region we serve has slowed dramatically in the last couple of years 
however  we have experienced customer growth  although this growth is less than we had been experiencing in recent years prior to the economic downturn 
employment improved slightly in most of our service area in after enduring significant cutbacks in the construction  forest products  mining and manufacturing sectors 
non farm employment growth for was percent in coeur d alene  idaho and medford  oregon 
it was flat in the spokane area but with positives in the retail trade and health sectors  offset by weakness in state and local government jobs 
us nonfarm sector jobs grew by percent in the same period 
unemployment rates declined in december from the year earlier levels in spokane and medford  but rose in coeur d alene 
the spokane rate declined from percent to percent from december to december and medford from percent to percent while coeur d alene rose from percent to percent 
the us rate declined from percent to percent in the same period 
although showing modest improvement during  the housing markets in coeur d alene and medford have higher foreclosure rates than the national average 
the december national rate was percent with percent in kootenai county  idaho and percent in jackson county  oregon 
the spokane housing market had a foreclosure rate of percent 
based on our forecast for electric customer growth to average to percent per year and natural gas customer growth to average to percent within our service area  we anticipate retail electric and natural gas load growth will average between and percent annually for the four year period we anticipate customer and load growth at the lower end of the range in and an economic recovery and modest recovery trend growth as the economy strengthens during the four year period 
while the number of electric and natural gas customers is growing  the average annual usage by each residential customer has not changed significantly 
electric and natural gas sales growth have slowed as retail prices have increased relative to historical prices and company sponsored conservation programs have intensified 
population increases and business growth in our three state service territory remains above the national average 
natural gas loads for space heating vary significantly with annual fluctuations in weather within our service territories 
the forward looking statements set forth above regarding retail load growth are based  in part  upon purchased economic forecasts and publicly available population and demographic studies 
the expectations regarding retail load growth are also based upon various assumptions  including assumptions relating to weather and economic and competitive conditions  internal analysis of company specific data  such as energy consumption patterns  internal business plans  and an assumption that we will incur no material loss of retail customers due to self generation or retail wheeling 
changes in actual experience can vary significantly from our projections 
environmental issues and other contingencies we are subject to environmental regulation by federal  state and local authorities 
the generation  transmission  distribution  service and storage facilities in which we have ownership interests are designed and operated in compliance with applicable environmental laws 
furthermore  we conduct periodic reviews and audits of pertinent facilities and operations to ensure compliance and to respond to or anticipate emerging environmental issues 
the company s board of directors has a committee to oversee environmental issues 
we monitor legislative and regulatory developments at all levels of government for environmental issues  particularly those with the potential to alter the operation and productivity of our generating plants and other assets 
environmental laws and regulations may increase the operating costs of generating plants  increase the lead time and capital costs for the construction of new generating plants  require modification of our existing generating plants  require existing generating plant operations to be curtailed or shut down  reduce the amount of energy available from our generating plants  restrict the types of generating plants that can be built  and require construction of specific types of generation plants at higher cost 
compliance with environmental laws and regulations could result in increases to capital expenditures and operating expenses 
we intend to seek recovery of any such costs through the ratemaking process 

table of contents avista corporation climate change and greenhouse gas emission reduction initiatives concerns about long term global climate changes could have a significant effect on our business 
our operations could also be affected by changes in laws and regulations intended to mitigate the risk of global climate changes  including restrictions on the operation of our power generation resources and obligations imposed on the sale of natural gas 
changing temperatures and precipitation  including snowpack conditions  affect the availability and timing of the streamflows  which impacts hydroelectric generation 
extreme weather events could increase service interruptions  outages and maintenance costs 
changing temperatures could also increase or decrease customer demand 
greenhouse gas ghg emission standards could result in significant compliance costs 
such standards could also preclude us from developing  operating or contracting with certain types of generating plants 
we continue to monitor and evaluate the possible adoption of international  national  regional  or state ghg emission legislation and regulations 
in particular  climate change legislation was passed in the state of washington  which includes a bill establishing ghg emissions reduction targets and another requiring that regulated sources report ghg emission from facilities that emit more than  metric tons per year 
as the us congress did not enact any comprehensive climate change legislation in  for the foreseeable future climate change regulations are expected to emerge from the epa and individual states 
although we are actively monitoring developments for climate change policies and restrictions on ghg emissions  it is important to note that we have relatively low ghg emissions as compared to other investor owned utilities in the us with percent of our electric generation resource mix derived from renewable sources including hydroelectric  biomass and wind contracts and a majority of our thermal generation fueled with natural gas  plus a commitment to energy efficiency  we are among the lowest carbon emitting utilities in the nation 
we have a climate council an interdisciplinary team of management and other employees which is designed to anticipate and evaluate strategic needs and opportunities relating to climate change  analyze the company wide implications of various trends and proposals  develop recommendations on positions and action plans  and facilitate internal and external communications regarding climate change issues 
longer term issues followed by the climate council include state and federal emissions tracking and certification  recommendations for ghg reduction goals and activities  the merits of different reduction programs  the development of legislation  and climate change policies and activities adopted by other organizations 
national legislation climate change legislation has been proposed in the us congress  however  recent actions in the us senate and the outcome of the mid term november elections strongly indicate that climate change legislation is unlikely until or later 
we continue to monitor the situation for new developments that could affect our business 
recent epa initiatives related to climate change after a public comment and review period  in december  the epa issued an endangerment finding regarding ghg emissions from motor vehicles under section a of clean air act caa 
the epa found that the current and projected concentrations of the six key well mixed greenhouse gases carbon dioxide  methane  nitrous oxide  hydrofluorocarbons  perfluorocarbons  and sulfur hexafluoride in the atmosphere threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations 
the epa also found that the combined emissions of these well mixed greenhouse gases from new motor vehicles and new motor vehicle engines contribute to the ghg pollution which threatens public health and welfare 
the epa s findings are currently being challenged in the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit 
on april   the epa and the department of transportation s national highway safety administration announced a joint final rule establishing ghg emission standards for mobile sources 
the ghg emission standards for mobile sources became effective on january  the epa has concluded that the caa requires the agency to regulate ghg emissions from stationary sources through its preconstruction and operating permit programs on the date when epa regulations require any source mobile or stationary to meet ghg emission limits 
the epa s final decision has been challenged in the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit 
in september  the epa proposed a rule that would establish an applicability threshold for regulating ghg from stationary sources through the preconstruction and operating permit programs 
the epa issued a series of rules on december  to narrow the caa permitting requirement so that facilities with ghg emissions below the levels set in the tailoring rule do not need permits as well as to give the epa authority to issue ghg permits in states that need to revise their permitting regulations to cover ghg emissions 
on january  
table of contents avista corporation  rules took effect requiring that permits issued under the caa for large stationary sources begin to address ghg emissions  as well as require best available control technology bact to control these emissions 
on january   the epa waived ghg permits for the next three years for utilities  boilers and other industrial facilities using biomass 
the epa also announced a schedule for issuing regulations controlling ghg emissions from electric generating units 
according to this schedule  the epa will propose standards for natural gas  oil and coal fired electric generating units by july   and issue final standards by may  the epa agreed to this schedule as part of a settlement with several states  local governments and environmental organizations that had sued the epa over its failure to update emissions standards for power plants and refineries as required by section of the caa 
section requires the epa to issue nsps that set emissions limits for new facilities and address emissions from existing facilities 
these rules could impact the costs of significantly modifying existing thermal plants as well as building new thermal generation sources 
we cannot determine or estimate the costs of compliance with such measures at this time 
in september  the epa finalized a rule that requires facilities emitting over  metric tons of greenhouse ghg a year to report their emissions to the epa beginning in january for emissions 
the rule became effective on december  data collection commenced january  and we will submit our first ghg emissions report to the epa by march  for covered facilities 
based on rule applicability criteria  colstrip  coyote springs  and the rathdrum ct will be required to report ghgs 
these facilities currently report carbon dioxide to the epa under the acid rain program and it is expected that the operators of colstrip and coyote springs will be responsible for any additional ghg reporting 
based on our evaluation of historical emissions from  none of our other electrical generation facilities meet the threshold requirements 
the rule also requires that natural gas distribution system throughput be reported 
monitoring methods  per the rule  are currently in place and development of a ghg monitoring plan for covered facilities was in place prior to the april  deadline for required monitoring method implementation 
the purpose of the plan is to document the process and procedures for collecting and reviewing the data needed to estimate annual ghg emissions 
on march   the epa proposed to amend its reporting rule to include several new source categories  including reporting of ghg emissions from electric power transmission and distribution systems 
on may   the epa issued a final rule on ghg emissions reporting for stationary sources 
as stated above  colstrip  coyote springs and the rathdrum ct will be required to report ghg emissions  even under modified rule 
we continue to monitor developments 
state activities the states of washington and oregon have statutory targets to reduce ghg emissions 
washington s targets are intended to reduce ghg emission to levels by  to percent below levels by  and to percent below levels by oregon s targets would reduce ghg emissions to percent below levels by and percent below levels by both states enacted their targets expecting that they would be met through a combination of renewable energy standards  and assorted complementary policies  such as land use policies  energy efficiency codes for buildings  renewable fuel standards and vehicle emission standards 
however  neither state has adopted any comprehensive requirements aimed at achieving these targets 
washington and oregon continue to participate in the western climate initiative wci  along with the states of arizona  california  new mexico  utah and montana  and the canadian provinces of british columbia  manitoba  ontario and quebec 
the wci has adopted a regional cap and trade program with an overall regional goal for reducing ghg emissions to percent below levels by the wci s program design includes cap and trade regulation of the electricity sector in and of emissions associated with the distribution of natural gas by neither washington  nor oregon has enacted legislation establishing the wci s program requirements 
the only members of the wci from the us that are prepared to participate in the wci s regional cap and trade system are california and new mexico 
a central element of the wci s cap and trade design is a requirement that its members regulate ghg emissions from sources of electricity that serve loads within their respective jurisdictions  even though those sources may be located beyond their boundaries 
in  the governor of washington issued an executive order directing the washington department of ecology to estimate ghg emissions by sector and source and to identify potential reduction requirements for them in preparation for the eventual imposition of state and or federal ghg regulations 
the department of ecology has identified facilities that emit more than  metric tons of ghg annually and has forecasted that those facilities will need to reduce their emissions by percent in order for the state to achieve its ghg emissions reduction target for our natural gas distribution system has been specifically identified as a facility along with our thermal plants and contracts with thermal plants 
fossil fueled generation outside of the state has also been generically deemed a facility for the purposes of potentially regulating emissions associated with the importation of power to serve our washington loads under cap and trade or other forms of regulation 
the state of washington has yet to identify how it might impose and enforce emission reductions since the legislature failed to enact a bill in that would have authorized the department of ecology to implement cap and trade policies 
the state s department of ecology is proceeding to adopt regulations to ensure that washington s state implementation plan comports with the requirements of the epa s regulation of ghg emissions 
we will continue to monitor actions by the department as it may proceed to adopt additional regulations under its clean air act authorities 

table of contents avista corporation washington and oregon apply a ghg emissions performance standard to electric generation facilities used to serve loads in their jurisdiction 
the emissions performance standard prevents utilities from constructing or purchasing generation facilities  or entering into long term contracts five years or more to purchase energy produced by plants that have emission levels higher than  pounds of ghg per mwh until  at which time it will be reviewed and may be lowered by administrative rule to reflect the emissions profile of the latest commercially available combined cycle combustion turbine 
initiative measure i  the energy independence act  was passed into law through the general election in washington 
i requires investor owned  cooperative  and government owned electric utilities with over  customers to acquire qualified renewable energy resources and or renewable energy credits in incremental amounts until those resources or credits equal percent of the utility total retail load in i also requires these utilities to meet biennial energy conservation targets  the first of which must be met in furthermore  by january   electric utilities subject to i s mandates must have acquired enough incremental renewable energy and or renewable energy credits to meet percent of their load 
failure to comply with renewable energy and energy efficiency standards will result in penalties of at least per mwh being assessed against a utility for each mwh it is deficient in meeting a standard 
a utility would be deemed to comply with the renewable energy standard if it invests at least percent of its total annual retail revenue requirement on the incremental costs of renewable energy resources and or renewable energy credits 
electric integrated resource plan our most recent electric integrated resource plan irp  which we filed with the wutc and the ipuc in the third quarter  includes the acquisition of additional renewable resources such that  if the preferred resources strategy is implemented  we would be compliant with the requirements of i by the various milestone dates 
highlights of the irp include up to mw of wind power by  an additional mw of wind power by  mw of natural gas fired generation facilities  aggressive energy efficiency measures to reduce new generation requirements by percent or mw  transmission upgrades are needed to integrate new generation resources into our system  and hydroelectric upgrades at existing facilities will generate additional renewable energy 
we are required to file an irp every two years 
we will file an irp in august and our resource strategy may change from the highlights included above based upon market  legislative and regulatory developments 
in february  we issued a rfp seeking to acquire up to amw of renewable energy  or as much as mw of nameplate wind capacity with deliveries beginning in we have issued this rfp due to recent market changes  tax incentives that remain in effect and a recent wutc policy statement indicating support of the acquisition of renewable resources in advance of renewable portfolio standards deadlines  if early acquisition can be cost justified 
we completed the acquisition of the development rights for a wind generation site in while this rfp does not include the development of this site  we will continue to study this site in preparation for later development 
we plan to meet the state of washington s renewable energy standards until with a combination of qualified upgrades at our existing hydroelectric generation plants and the purchase of a small amount of renewable energy credits from through the amount of renewable resources in our future irps could change if the cost effectiveness of those resources changes or if a federal renewable energy standard were passed 
as part of our irp  we included estimates of climate change into the retail load forecast 
the recent trend has been a warming climate compared to the year normal 
trends in heating and cooling degree days for spokane are roughly equal to the scientific community s predictions for this geographic area  implying one degree of warming every years 
incorporating the warming trend finds that in years summer load would be approximately amw higher than the year average 
in the winter  loads would be approximately amw lower in  for a net impact of a amw load decrease 
our projected system load for in the irp was  amw 
we do not expect this trend to have a material impact on our results of operations 
estimated costs of ghg emission credits were also included in the development of the irp market prices 
chicago climate exchange in october  we became a member of the chicago climate exchange ccx 
members agreed to reduce their ghg emissions by percent from an established baseline by the ccx allowed participants who exceeded their reduction targets to bank or sell the excess ccx carbon financial instruments 
we liquidated our surplus credits in june and july the audit establishing our baseline emissions was completed and we received  of vintage ccx carbon financial instruments in september the emissions audit data was submitted in the second quarter of and we received  of vintage ccx carbon financial instruments in october in october  the ccx announced that they will not be offering a phase program 
as such  we concluded our participation in the ccx in 
table of contents avista corporation clean air act we must comply with requirements under the caa and clean air act amendments caaa in operating our thermal generating plants 
the most significant impacts on us  related to the caa and the caaa  pertain to colstrip  which is a phase ii coal fired plant for sulfur dioxide so under the caaa 
however  we do not expect colstrip to be required to implement any additional so mitigation in the foreseeable future in order to continue operations 
our other thermal projects are subject to various caaa standards 
every five years each of the other thermal projects requires an updated operating permit known as a title v permit  which addresses  among other things  the compliance of the plant with the caaa 
the operating permit for the rathdrum ct was renewed in expires in and the operating permit for the kettle falls gs was renewed in expires in 
coyote springs was issued a renewed title v permit in that expires in boulder park and the northeast ct do not require a title v permit based on their limited output and instead each has a synthetic minor permit that does not expire 
mercury emissions in  the montana department of environmental quality montana deq adopted final rules for the control of mercury emissions from coal fired plants 
the new rules set strict mercury emission limits by  and establish a recurring ten year review process to ensure facilities are keeping pace with advancing technology in mercury emission control 
the rules also provide for temporary alternate emission limits provided certain provisions are met  and they allocate mercury emission credits in a manner that rewards the cleanest facilities 
the joint owners of colstrip believe  based upon current results  that the plant will be able to comply with the montana law without utilizing the temporary alternate emissions limit provision 
in addition  the epa has announced its intent to develop maximum achievable control technology standards to control hazardous air pollutants  including mercury  from coal fired power plants that do not allow for trading of emission allowances 
it is likely that the level of emissions required by the final rule will be based upon the average of the top percent of the best performers in the industry 
as a result  it is possible that the federal standard could be more stringent than the montana deq rule 
national ambient air quality standards we continue to monitor legislative and regulatory developments at both the state and national levels for potential further restrictions on national ambient air quality standards 
new  more stringent ambient air quality standards were adopted or are being adopted by the epa for nitrogen dioxide  ozone and particulate matter 
we have thermal power plants in washington  idaho  montana and oregon 
even under the new standards  the epa and the states have designated most of the western states in which we operate as attainment areas for the new standards 
we do not anticipate any material impacts on our thermal plants from these new standards 
coal ash management disposal currently  coal combustion byproducts ccbs are not regulated by the epa as a hazardous waste 
the epa is currently reconsidering the classification of ccbs under the resource conservation and recovery act rcra 
a draft proposal is under review at the office of management and budget  but no proposal regarding such regulation has been issued for public review or comment 
should the epa determine to regulate ccbs as a hazardous waste under the rcra  such action could have a significant impact on future operations of colstrip 
the epa provided proposed draft rules in for public review and comment  with two alternatives 
one would require management of ccbs as a hazardous waste under subtitle c of rcra  the other would regulate coal ash under subtitle d  for solid wastes 
along with many other parties  avista corp 
submitted comments supporting ongoing regulation of ccbs as a solid waste  with all applicable exclusions sustained 
the epa has not indicated any schedule for final rulemaking 
fisheries a number of species of fish in the northwest  including the snake river sockeye salmon and fall chinook salmon  the kootenai river white sturgeon  the upper columbia river steelhead  the upper columbia river spring chinook salmon and the bull trout  are listed as threatened or endangered under the federal endangered species act 
thus far  measures that were adopted and implemented to save the snake river sockeye salmon and fall chinook salmon have not directly impacted generation levels at any of our hydroelectric facilities 
we purchase power under long term contracts with certain puds on the columbia river that are directly impacted by ongoing mitigation measures for salmon and steelhead 
the reduction in generation at these projects is relatively minor  resulting in minimal economic impact on our operations at this time 
we cannot predict the economic costs to us resulting from future mitigation measures 
we received a year ferc operating license for cabinet gorge and noxon rapids in march that incorporates a comprehensive settlement agreement 
the restoration of native salmonid fish  particularly bull trout  is a key part of the agreement 
the result is a collaborative bull trout recovery program with the us fish and wildlife service  native american tribes and the states of idaho and montana on the lower clark fork river  consistent with requirements of the ferc license 
see hydroelectric licensing and fish passage at cabinet gorge and noxon rapids in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

table of contents avista corporation western power market issues the ferc continues to conduct proceedings and investigations related to market controls within the western united states that include proposals by certain parties to impose refunds  and some of the ferc s decisions have been appealed in federal courts 
certain parties have asserted claims for significant refunds from us  which could result in liabilities for refunding revenues recognized in prior periods 
we have joined other parties in opposing these proposals 
we believe that we have adequate reserves established for refunds that may be ordered 
the refund proceedings provide that any refunds would be offset against unpaid energy debts due to the same party 
as of december   our accounts receivable outstanding related to defaulting parties in california were fully offset by reserves for uncollected amounts and funds collected from defaulting parties

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general our power supply cost varies because of several factors 
we optimize the mix of power resources to meet our retail customer requirements and other obligations 
we also use our resources and obtain resources from others in the wholesale power market including natural gas fuel markets 
hydroelectric generation is typically the least cost source of supply  but the amount of hydroelectric generation depends on streamflow conditions affected by both the volume and timing of precipitation  including snow melt patterns and other factors in the watersheds for our hydroelectric facilities 
thermal generation resource costs vary with fuel costs and other factors 
wholesale market prices tend to vary with natural gas fuel costs to the extent that natural gas fired resources are the least cost alternative in the region which is often the case in recent years 
generating resource availability and regional demand tend to impact energy prices  which affect our net power supply costs 
even with regulatory cost recovery mechanisms that address these power supply cost variations  a portion of the cost variation is not passed on to customers 
in addition  the timing of incurring costs can be significantly different than the timing for recovering costs  resulting in the need for a significant liquidity cushion 
our hydroelectric generation was below normal based on a year average in and in nine of the past eleven years 
we cannot determine if lower than normal hydroelectric generation will continue in future years 
when we have excess hydroelectric generation  its value varies with market prices and other displaceable resources 
when hydroelectric generation is below normal  the cost to obtain power from other sources is generally higher 
when hydroelectric generation is above normal  prices in the wholesale market are often depressed which can adversely impact our surplus sales revenues 
we are not able to predict how the combination of energy resources  energy loads  prices  rate recovery and other factors will ultimately drive deferred power costs and the timing of recovery of our costs in future periods 
see further information at avista utilities regulatory matters 
market prices for natural gas continue to be competitive compared to alternative fuel sources for customers  and we believe that natural gas should sustain its long term market advantage over competing energy sources based on the levels of existing reserves and potential natural gas development in the future 
growth has occurred in the natural gas business due to increased demand for natural gas in new construction and conversions from competing space and water heating energy sources to natural gas 
certain natural gas customers could by pass our natural gas system  reducing both revenues and recovery of fixed costs 
to reduce the potential for such by pass  we price natural gas services  including transportation contracts  competitively and have varying degrees of flexibility to price transportation and delivery rates by means of individual contracts 
these individual contracts are subject to state regulatory review and approval 
we have long term transportation contracts with several of our largest industrial customers under which the customer assumes the risk of acquiring their own commodity while using our infrastructure for delivery 
such contracts reduce the risk of these customers by passing our system in the foreseeable future and minimizes the impact on our earnings 
commodity price risk in general  price risk is driven by fluctuation in the market price of the commodity needed  held or traded 
the price of energy in wholesale markets is affected primarily by fundamental factors related to production costs and by other factors including weather and the resulting impact on retail loads 
we hedge our exposure to price risk by making forward commitments for energy purchases and sales as further described under risk management 

table of contents avista corporation wholesale electricity prices are affected by a number of factors  including demand for electricity  the number of market participants and the willingness of market participants to trade  adequacy of generating reserve margins  scheduled and unscheduled outages of generating facilities  availability of streamflows for hydroelectric generation  price and availability of fuel for thermal generating plants  and disruptions of or constraints on transmission facilities 
wholesale natural gas prices are affected by a number of factors  including overall actual and expected changes in the north american natural gas supply mix including the growth in unconventional supplies such as natural gas shale  natural gas production that can be delivered to our service areas  level of imports and exports  particularly from canada by pipeline  level of inventories and regional accessibility  demand for natural gas  including natural gas as fuel for electric generation  the number of market participants and the willingness of market participants to trade  global energy markets  including oil or other natural gas substitutes  and availability of pipeline capacity to transport natural gas from region to region 
any combination of these factors that results in a shortage of energy generally causes the market price to move upward 
factors such as a general economic downturn  increased proven energy reserves  or increased production generally reduce market prices for energy 
in addition to these factors  wholesale power markets are subject to regulatory constraints including price controls 
price risk also includes the risk of fluctuation in the market price of associated derivative commodity instruments such as options and forward contracts 
price risk may also be influenced to the extent that the performance or non performance by market participants of their contractual obligations and commitments affect the supply of  or demand for  the commodity 
we have mechanisms in each regulatory jurisdiction that provide for recovery of the majority of our power and natural gas costs 
the majority of power and natural gas costs exceeding the amount currently recovered through retail rates  excluding the erm deadband and other sharing components in washington  are deferred on our consolidated balance sheets for the opportunity for recovery through future retail rates 
the recovery of these deferred power and natural gas costs is subject to review for prudence and  as such  certain deferred costs may be disallowed by the respective regulatory agencies 
substantially all forward contracts to purchase or sell power and natural gas are recorded as derivative assets or liabilities at estimated fair value with an offsetting regulatory asset or liability 
contracts that are not considered derivatives are generally accounted for on the accrual basis until they are settled or realized  unless there is a decline in the fair value of the contract that is determined to be other than temporary 
the following table presents energy commodity derivative fair values as a net asset or liability as of december  that are expected to settle in each respective year dollars in thousands purchases sales electric derivatives gas derivatives electric derivatives gas derivatives year physical financial physical financial physical financial physical financial thereafter credit risk credit risk relates to potential losses that we would incur as a result of non performance of contractual obligations by counterparties to deliver energy or make financial settlements 
we often extend credit to counterparties and customers  and we are exposed to the risk of not being able to collect amounts owed to us 
changes in market prices may dramatically alter the size of credit risk with counterparties  even when we establish conservative credit limits 
credit risk includes potential counterparty default due to circumstances relating directly to the counterparty  caused by market price changes  and relating to other market participants that have a direct or indirect relationship with such counterparty 

table of contents avista corporation should a counterparty  customer or supplier fail to perform  we may be required to honor the underlying commitment or to replace existing contracts with contracts at then current market prices 
we seek to mitigate credit risk by entering into bilateral contracts that specify credit terms and protections against default  applying credit limits and duration criteria to existing and prospective counterparties  actively monitoring current credit exposures  and conducting some of our transactions on exchanges with clearing arrangements that essentially eliminate counterparty default risk 
our credit policies include an evaluation of the financial condition and credit ratings of counterparties  collateral requirements or other credit enhancements  such as letters of credit or parent company guarantees 
we also use standardized agreements that allow for the netting or offsetting of positive and negative exposures associated with a single counterparty or affiliated group 
however  despite mitigation efforts  defaults by our counterparties periodically occur 
we regularly evaluate counterparties credit exposure for future settlements and delivery obligations 
we reduce or eliminate open unsecured credit limits and implement other credit risk reduction measures for parties perceived to have increased default risk 
counterparty collateral is used to offset our credit risk where unsettled net positions and future obligations by counterparties to pay us or deliver to us warrant 
we have concentrations of suppliers and customers in the electric and natural gas industries including electric utilities  electric generators and transmission providers  natural gas producers and pipelines  financial institutions  and energy marketing and trading companies 
in addition  we have concentrations of credit risk related to geographic location in the western united states and western canada 
these concentrations of counterparties and concentrations of geographic location may affect our overall exposure to credit risk because the counterparties may be similarly affected by changes in conditions 
credit risk also involves the exposure that counterparties perceive related to our ability to perform deliveries and settlement under physical and financial energy contracts 
these counterparties may seek assurances of performance in the form of letters of credit  prepayment or cash deposits from us 
credit exposure can change significantly in periods of price volatility 
as a result  sudden and significant demands may be made against our credit facilities and cash 
we actively monitor the exposure to possible collateral calls and take steps to minimize capital requirements 
counterparties credit exposure to us is dynamic in normal markets and may change significantly in more volatile markets 
the amount of potential default risk to us  from each counterparty  depends on the extent of forward contracts  unsettled transactions and market prices 
there is a risk that we may seek additional collateral from counterparties that are unable or unwilling to provide 
credit risks related to our retail customer base include the extent to which customers do not pay or are slow to pay for energy we have delivered to them 
we are allowed to recover normal credit losses in retail rates but economic conditions for our customers may result in unrecovered credit losses 
we also extend credit generally for up to five years in certain circumstances to construction developers for the cost of utility infrastructure investment 
the infrastructure costs are typically recovered when new customers begin receiving utility service but to the extent that customers do not connect as planned  we may carry credit risks with these developers 
we maintain credit reserves that are based on the evaluation of the credit risk of the overall portfolio 
based on our credit policies  exposures and credit reserves  we do not anticipate a materially adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations as a result of counterparty nonperformance 

table of contents avista corporation interest rate risk we are affected by fluctuating interest rates related to a portion of our existing debt and our future borrowing requirements 
we manage interest rate exposure by limiting our variable rate exposures to a percentage of total capitalization and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates 
additionally  interest rate risk is managed by monitoring market conditions when timing the issuance of long term debt and optional debt redemptions and through the use of fixed rate long term debt with varying maturities 
we also enter into financial derivative instruments  which may include interest rate swaps and us treasury lock agreements to manage and mitigate interest rate risk exposure 
in the second quarter of  we entered into two interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of million and a mandatory cash settlement date of july under the terms of the outstanding interest rate swap agreements  the value of the interest rate swaps is determined based upon avista corp 
paying a fixed rate and receiving a variable rate based on libor for a term of ten years 
as of december   we had a long term derivative asset of million and an offsetting regulatory liability  as well as a long term derivative liability and an offsetting regulatory asset of less than million on the consolidated balance sheets in accordance with regulatory accounting practices 
upon settlement of the interest rate swaps  the regulatory asset or liability included as part of long term debt will be amortized as a component of interest expense over the life of the forecasted interest payments 
we estimate that a basis point increase in forward libor interest rates as of december  would decrease this derivative liability by million  while a basis point decrease would increase the liability by million 
the interest rate on million of long term debt to affiliated trusts is adjusted quarterly  reflecting current market rates 
amounts borrowed under our committed line of credit agreements have variable interest rates 
the weighted average variable rate on outstanding short term borrowings was percent at december  the following table shows our long term debt including current portion and related weighted average interest rates  by expected maturity dates as of december  dollars in thousands thereafter total fair value fixed rate long term debt weighted average interest rate fixed rate nonrecourse long term debt of spokane energy weighted average interest rate variable rate long term debt to affiliated trusts weighted average interest rate foreign currency risk a significant portion of our utility natural gas supply including fuel for electric generation is obtained from canadian sources 
most of those transactions are executed in us dollars  which avoids foreign currency risk 
a portion of our short term natural gas transactions and long term canadian transportation contracts are committed based on canadian currency prices and settled within sixty days with us dollars 
we economically hedge a portion of the foreign currency risk by purchasing canadian currency when such commodity transactions are initiated 
this risk has not had a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows and these differences in cost related to currency fluctuations were included with natural gas supply costs for ratemaking 
as of december   we had a current derivative asset for foreign currency hedges of million included in other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet 
as of december   we had entered into canadian currency forward contracts with a notional amount of million million canadian 
risk management we use a variety of techniques to manage risks for energy resources and wholesale energy market activities 
we have an energy resources risk policy and control procedures to manage these risks  both qualitative and quantitative 
our risk management committee has established our risk management policy for energy resources 
the risk 
table of contents avista corporation management committee is comprised of certain officers and other management 
the audit committee of the company s board of directors periodically reviews and discusses risk assessment and risk management policies  including the company s material financial and accounting risk exposures and the steps management has undertaken to control them 
our risk management committee reviews the status of risk exposures through regular reports and meetings and it monitors compliance with our risk management policy and control procedures 
nonetheless  adverse changes in commodity prices  generating capacity  customer loads  regulation and other factors may result in losses of earnings  cash flows and or fair values 
our risk management committee has also established a wholesale energy markets credit policy 
the credit policy is designed to reduce the risk of financial loss in case counterparties default on delivery or settlement obligations and to conserve our liquidity as other parties may place credit limits or require cash collateral 
we measure the volume of monthly  quarterly and annual energy imbalances between projected power loads and resources 
the measurement process is based on expected loads at fixed prices including those subject to retail rates and expected resources to the extent that costs are essentially fixed by virtue of known fuel supply costs or projected hydroelectric conditions 
to the extent that expected costs are not fixed  either because of volume mismatches between loads and resources or because fuel cost is not locked in through fixed price contracts or derivative instruments  our risk policy guides the process to manage this open forward position over a period of time 
normal operations result in seasonal mismatches between power loads and available resources 
we are able to vary the operation of generating resources to match parts of hourly  daily and weekly load fluctuations 
we use the wholesale power markets  including the natural gas market as it relates to power generation fuel  to sell projected resource surpluses and obtain resources when deficits are projected 
we buy and sell fuel for thermal generation facilities based on comparative power market prices and marginal costs of fueling and operating available generating facilities and the relative economics of substitute market purchases for generating plant operation 
effective january   the natural gas fired lancaster power purchase agreement was added to our utility resource portfolio  which increased the extent of transactions for natural gas fuel hedging and plant optimization 
to address the impact on our operations of energy market price volatility  our hedging practices for electricity including fuel for generation and natural gas extend beyond the current operating year 
executing this extended hedging program may increase our credit risks 
our credit risk management process is designed to mitigate such credit risks through limit setting  contract protections and counterparty diversification  among other practices 
electric load resource imbalances within a planning horizon up to months ahead are compared against established volumetric guidelines 
management determines the timing and actions to manage the imbalances 
we also assess available resource alternatives and actions that are appropriate for longer term planning periods 
expected load and resource volumes for forward periods are based on monthly and quarterly averages that may vary significantly from the actual loads and resources within any individual month or operating day 
future projections of resources are updated as forecasted streamflows and other factors differ from prior estimates 
forward power markets may be illiquid  and market products available may not match our desired transaction size and shape 
therefore  open imbalance positions exist at any given time 
our projected natural gas loads and resources are regularly reviewed by operating management and the risk management committee 
to manage the impacts of volatile natural gas prices  we seek to procure natural gas through a diversified mix of spot market purchases and forward fixed price purchases from various supply basins and time periods 
we have an active hedging program that extends four years into the future with the goal of reducing price volatility in our natural gas supply costs 
we use natural gas storage capacity to support high demand periods and to procure natural gas when prices are likely to be seasonally lower 
securing prices throughout the year and even into subsequent years at multiple basins mitigates potential adverse impacts of significant purchase requirements in a volatile price environment
