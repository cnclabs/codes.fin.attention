item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a describes the matters that we consider to be important in understanding the results of our operations for the three years ended june   and and our liquidity and capital resources as of june  and our fiscal year begins on july and ends on june unless otherwise noted  references to year pertain to our fiscal year  for example  refers to fiscal  which is the period from july  to june  in the discussion that follows  we analyze the results of our operations for the last three years  including the trends in our overall business  followed by a discussion of our cash flows and liquidity and contractual obligations 
we then provide a review of the critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are most important to an understanding of our md a and our consolidated financial statements 
we conclude our md a with information on recently issued accounting pronouncements 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto  all included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the forward looking statements in this section and other parts of this report involve risks and uncertainties including statements regarding our plans  objectives  goals  strategies  and financial performance 
our actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of factors set forth under the caption forward looking statements 
executive summary business overview lancaster colony corporation is a diversified manufacturer and marketer of consumer products focusing primarily on specialty foods for the retail and foodservice markets 
we also manufacture and market candles for the food  drug and mass markets 
although not material to our consolidated operations  we are also engaged in the distribution of various products  including glassware and candles  to commercial markets 
our operations are organized in two reportable segments specialty foods and glassware and candles 
over of the sales of each segment are made to customers in the united states 
in recent years  our strategy has shifted away from operating businesses in a variety of industries towards emphasizing the growth and success we have achieved in our specialty foods segment 
fiscal years prior to were significant years in implementing this strategy as we divested various nonfood operations and focused our capital investment in the specialty foods segment 
these strategic dispositions and investments resulted in transforming our company into a predominately food focused business 
in  approximately of our consolidated net sales and effectively all of our operating income were derived from the specialty foods segment 
for perspective  in  our specialty foods segment comprised approximately and of our reported consolidated net sales and operating income  respectively 
we intend to periodically reassess the strategic fit and contribution of our remaining nonfood operations in light of market conditions  capital needs and other factors 
our current strategy focuses our efforts on the most profitable part of our business and minimizes the amount of financial and management resources devoted to our nonfood operations 
we believe we are positioned to maximize the future potential of our specialty foods segment 
we view our food operations as having the potential to achieve future growth in sales and profitability due to attributes such as leading retail market positions in several branded products with a high quality perception  a broad customer base in both retail and foodservice accounts  well regarded culinary expertise among foodservice accounts  recognized leadership in foodservice product development  experience in integrating complementary business acquisitions  and historically strong cash flow generation that supports growth opportunities 

table of contents our goal is to grow our specialty foods retail and foodservice business over time by leveraging the strength of our retail brands to increase current product sales and introduce new products  growing our foodservice sales through the strength of our reputation in product development and quality  and pursuing acquisitions that meet our strategic criteria 
within retail markets  our specialty foods segment utilizes numerous branded products to support growth and maintain market competitiveness 
we place great emphasis on our product innovation and development efforts so as to enhance growth by providing distinctive new products meeting the evolving needs and preferences of consumers 
our foodservice sales primarily consist of products sold to restaurant chains 
over the long term  we have experienced broad based growth in our foodservice sales  as we build on our strong reputation for product development and quality 
we expect that part of our future growth in the specialty foods segment will result from acquisitions 
we continue to review potential acquisitions that we believe will provide good complements to our existing product lines  enhance our gross margins or offer good expansion opportunities in a manner that fits our overall goals 
as has occasionally been required to support future growth opportunities  we have historically made substantial capital investments to support our existing food operations  such as the construction of a new frozen yeast roll facility in horse cave  kentucky that began operations in and was significantly expanded through a project that was completed in june at an adjoining location  we began production activities at a newly constructed dressing facility in both facilities helped accommodate potential future sales growth and also provided greater manufacturing efficiencies 
based on our current plans and expectations  we believe that our total capital expenditures for will be approximately million 
summary of results the following is an overview of our consolidated operating results for the year ended june  consolidated net sales reached approximately  million during  increasing by approximately as compared to prior year net sales of  million  driven by growth coming from both operating segments 
the specialty foods segment s increase reflected higher foodservice sales  which were partially offset by lower retail sales 
the increase in sales of the glassware and candles segment primarily reflected higher candle sales volumes from product placement into new accounts that began in the fourth quarter of gross margin decreased to approximately million from the prior year comparable total of million 
increasing raw material costs  as well as a less favorable sales mix and higher freight costs within the specialty foods segment  contributed to the lower gross margin 
overall results were also affected by the funds received under cdsoa 
in  we received approximately million under cdsoa  as compared to approximately million in and approximately million in for a more detailed discussion of cdsoa  see the subcaption other income continued dumping and subsidy offset act of this md a 
net income totaled approximately million in  or per diluted share  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  in net income in totaled approximately million  or per diluted share 
looking forward we are anticipating continued growth in consolidated sales during factors that we believe should contribute to our growth include the incremental impact of several recently introduced retail food products  the implementation of higher pricing among various product lines  as well as the expansion of existing 
table of contents product lines with current customers or into new geographic markets 
we will also continue to review acquisition opportunities within the specialty foods segment that are consistent with our growth strategy and represent good value or otherwise provide significant strategic benefits 
however  unsettled economic conditions affecting consumer and retailer buying patterns are among the many influences that may impact sales improvement and our ability to improve operating margins in the coming year 
within our specialty foods segment  with respect to material input and freight costs  we enter experiencing an elevation of such costs over levels 
it is possible that future changes in the economy and regulatory environment could cause further increases in these costs 
to help offset or stabilize the impact of such increases  we have pursued other operational strategies that we believe will aid our future results 
for example  as part of our cost reduction efforts  we consolidated our wilson  new york and atlanta  georgia production operations into our other existing facilities in the second quarter of and early  respectively 
further  the expansion of our frozen roll capacity is expected to improve production throughput and reduce third party warehouse costs 
we are also continuing to limit some of our exposure to volatile swings in food commodity costs through a structured purchasing program for certain future requirements 
we do expect to realize higher pricing in  but we believe that the related income may ultimately be less than the total increase in material and freight costs 
with respect to our glassware and candles segment  we expect lower sales levels  especially for holiday products  as some lower margin business was not retained 
higher wax costs will continue to negatively impact the segment s operating results  and it will be challenging to maintain operating efficiencies with the expected lower production levels 
accordingly  we currently expect this segment s operating income will be challenged to reach the level of for a more detailed discussion of the effect of commodity costs  see the impact of inflation section of this md a below 
in order to ensure that our capitalization is adequate to support our future internal growth prospects  acquire food businesses consistent with our strategic goals  and maintain cash returns to our shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases  we will need to maintain sufficient flexibility in our future capital structure 
we will continue to reassess our allocation of capital periodically to ensure that we maintain adequate operating flexibility while providing appropriate levels of cash returns to our shareholders  whether through share repurchases or cash dividends  including special dividends  if appropriate 
review of consolidated operations segment sales mix the relative proportion of sales contributed by each of our business segments can impact a year to year comparison of the consolidated statements of income 
the following table summarizes the sales mix over each of the last three years segment sales mix specialty foods glassware and candles net sales and gross margin year ended june change dollars in thousands vs 
vs 
net sales specialty foods glassware and candles total gross margin gross margin as a percentage of sales 
table of contents consolidated net sales for the year ended june  increased by approximately to approximately  million from the prior year total of approximately  million 
this sales growth reflected improved results in both operating segments 
the specialty foods segment s increase reflected higher foodservice sales  which were partially offset by lower retail sales 
the foodservice sales increase resulted from both higher pricing and new programs with some large restaurant chains 
the decline in retail sales was influenced by the exiting of less profitable dressing lines midway through  the loss of product placement for certain produce dips at one customer and generally weak retail market conditions 
the increase in sales of the glassware and candles segment primarily reflected higher candle volumes from product placement into new accounts that began in the fourth quarter of consolidated net sales for the year ended june  increased by less than over the total of approximately  million 
in  increased sales within the glassware and candles segment were partially offset by lower sales within the specialty foods segment 
the specialty foods segment s sales decline reflected moderately lower foodservice sales  as partially offset by higher retail sales 
the increase in net sales of the glassware and candles segment reflected higher unit volume on improved consumer demand for high quality  value priced candles and the introduction and success of various new products 
our gross margin as a percentage of net sales was approximately in compared with in and in as a percentage of net sales  higher material costs in are estimated to have impacted gross margin comparisons by approximately 
in the specialty foods segment  gross margin percentages declined in  reflecting broadly higher ingredient and freight costs and a less favorable sales mix 
gross margin percentages in the glassware and candles segment declined in due to higher wax costs and  to a lesser extent  lower production volumes 
as a percentage of net sales  lower material costs in are estimated to have benefited gross margin comparisons to by over 
in  the specialty foods segment s gross margin percentages improved as a result of lower commodity costs  a stronger retail mix and operating efficiency improvements 
gross margin percentages in the glassware and candles segment improved in due to lower material costs  especially for paraffin wax  and higher sales and production levels 
selling  general and administrative expenses year ended june change dollars in thousands vs 
vs 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a expense as a percentage of sales selling  general and administrative expenses for totaled approximately million and increased as compared with the total of million  while the total had increased from the total of million 
higher sales based expenses  increased compensation expense and greater consumer directed marketing costs contributed to the overall increase for  although as a percentage of sales the expenses were comparable to in  increased costs in consumer directed marketing initiatives to support retail sales and increased professional fees within the specialty foods segment contributed to the overall increase 
restructuring and impairment charges specialty foods segment in  we closed our dressings and sauces manufacturing operation located in wilson  new york 
during  we recorded restructuring charges of approximately million million after taxes 
this closure was essentially complete at december  we do not expect any other costs or cash expenditures related to this closure 
in  we consolidated our atlanta  georgia dressing operation into our other existing food facilities 
during  we recorded restructuring and impairment charges of approximately million million after taxes 
this closure was essentially complete at september   and the disposition of the 
table of contents associated real estate occurred in december we do not expect any other costs or cash expenditures related to this closure 
other in  we closed our industrial glass operation that was located in lancaster  ohio 
the majority of the total million restructuring and impairment charge related to this closure was recorded in  but we did incur approximately million million after taxes during the year ended june  the charge was recorded in corporate expenses 
we do not currently expect other significant restructuring costs related to this closure 
operating income loss year ended june change dollars in thousands vs 
vs 
operating income loss specialty foods glassware and candles corporate expenses total operating income loss as a percentage of sales specialty foods glassware and candles consolidated due to the factors discussed above  consolidated operating income for totaled approximately million  a decrease from operating income of million 
the total had increased from operating income totaling approximately million 
see further discussion of operating results by segment following the discussion of net income below 
interest expense we incurred no interest expense in and as there were no borrowings outstanding during these years 
interest expense of approximately million recorded in related to long term borrowings 
we had no outstanding borrowings at june  and other income continued dumping and subsidy offset act cdsoa provides for the distribution of monies collected by us customs from antidumping cases to qualifying domestic producers 
our reported cdsoa receipts totaled approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
cdsoa remittances have related to certain candles being imported from the people s republic of china 
legislation was enacted in february to repeal the applicability of cdsoa to duties collected on products imported after september accordingly  we may receive some level of annual distributions for an undetermined period of years in the future as the monies collected that relate to entries filed prior to october are administratively finalized by us customs 
without further legislative action  we expect these distributions will eventually cease 
in addition to this legislative development  cases have been brought in us courts challenging cdsoa 
in two separate cases  the us court of international trade cit ruled that the procedure for determining recipients eligible to receive cdsoa distributions is unconstitutional 
the us court of appeals for the federal circuit reversed both cit decisions and the us supreme court did not hear either case 
this effectively ended the constitutional challenges brought in these cases  but other cases challenging cdsoa remain active 

table of contents we are unable to determine  at this time  what the ultimate outcome of other litigation will be  and it is possible that further legal action  potential additional changes in the law and other factors could affect the amount of funds available for distribution  including funds relating to entries prior to october accordingly  we cannot predict the amount of future distributions we may receive 
any change in cdsoa distributions could affect our earnings and cash flow 
interest income and other net interest income and other was income of approximately million  income of less than million and expense of approximately million in  and  respectively 
income before income taxes as affected by the factors discussed above  our income before income taxes for of approximately million decreased from the total of million 
the total income before income taxes was approximately million 
our effective tax rate was  and in  and  respectively 
the rate was primarily impacted by the domestic manufacturing deduction  for which there was a rate increase in the current year 
as compared to  the lower rate in reflected  in part  a favorable resolution of certain previously reserved state and local tax matters in  as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
net income net income for of approximately million decreased from net income of million 
net income was approximately million in diluted net income per share totaled approximately in  a decrease from the prior year total of 
the latter amount was higher than diluted earnings per share of 
income per share in each of the last three years has been beneficially affected by share repurchases  which have totaled approximately million over the three year period ended june  segment review specialty foods during  net sales of the specialty foods segment set a new record level  surpassing the previous record set in  while operating income of approximately million decreased from the level of million 
increasing material and freight costs  as well as a less favorable sales mix  contributed to the lower level of operating income 
net sales during totaled approximately million  an increase from the prior year total of million 
sales for decreased from the total of approximately million 
the percentage of retail customer sales within the segment was approximately during  as compared to in and in in  net sales of the specialty foods segment increased by approximately 
contribution from higher pricing was approximately of net sales 
the segment s foodservice net sales rose approximately on increased volumes  particularly from new programs with existing large chain restaurants  and higher pricing 
retail net sales declined approximately as influenced by the prior year rationalization of some product lines associated with the mid year closing of one of our dressing facilities 
also  sales of produce dips declined  reflecting a weaker category and the loss of placement for certain products at one of our customers 
mitigating these declines were higher retail sales of frozen rolls and the success of several recently introduced products 
the decline in net sales of the specialty foods segment in reflected generally flat volumes and lower pricing to customers in foodservice channels 
higher sales to retail channel customers were more than offset by lower foodservice sales 
foodservice sales declined by approximately for the year ended june   with contributing factors including weaker chain restaurant demand and downward pricing adjustments in certain of our customer supply arrangements that occurred as a result of lower key ingredient costs 
net sales to retail channel customers increased in on volume growth from several product lines  as partially offset by the exiting of less profitable dressing lines with the closing of our wilson  new york operation 
operating income of the specialty foods segment in totaled approximately million  a decrease from the record level of million 
the level was higher than the level of million 
the decrease reflected broadly higher ingredient and freight costs  a less favorable sales mix and increased marketing costs 
we estimate that higher material costs adversely affected the segment s 
table of contents comparative results by approximately of net sales 
the increase reflected lower commodity costs  a stronger retail sales mix and operating efficiency improvements 
we estimate that the favorable year over year impact of commodity costs approximated of net sales 
segment review glassware and candles glassware and candles segment net sales totaled approximately million during  as compared to million in and million in the increase reflected higher candle sales volumes  mainly product placement into new accounts that began in the fourth quarter of in  the increase in net sales reflected higher unit volume on improved consumer demand for high quality  value priced candles and the introduction  expanded product placement and the success of various new products 
the segment recorded operating income of approximately million in and million in compared to an operating loss of million during despite the benefits of achieving higher sales volumes in  operating results were adversely affected by higher wax costs and  to a lesser extent  lower production volumes 
we estimate that higher wax costs in the glassware and candles segment adversely affected the segment s comparative results in by approximately of net sales 
operating results of the glassware and candles segment improved in due to lower material costs  especially for paraffin wax  and higher sales and production levels 
we estimate the favorable year over year impact of wax costs for the year ended june  approximated of the segment s net sales 
corporate expenses the corporate expenses totaled approximately million as compared to million in and million in the higher level of corporate expenses for and related to costs associated with our idle real estate holdings while the increase in expenses in from related to increased professional fees and personnel related costs 
financial condition liquidity and capital resources in order to ensure that our capitalization is adequate to support our future internal growth prospects  acquire food businesses consistent with our strategic goals  and maintain cash returns to our shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases  we will need to maintain sufficient flexibility in our future capital structure 
our balance sheet retained fundamental financial strength during  and we ended the year with approximately million in cash and equivalents  along with shareholders equity of nearly million and no debt 
under our unsecured revolving credit facility  we may borrow up to a maximum of million at any one time 
loans may be used for general corporate purposes 
we had no borrowings outstanding under this facility at june  the facility expires in october  and all outstanding amounts are then due and payable 
at june   we had approximately million of standby letters of credit outstanding  which reduced the amount available for borrowing on the unsecured revolving credit facility 
the facility contains certain restrictive covenants  including limitations on indebtedness  asset sales and acquisitions  and financial covenants relating to interest coverage and leverage 
at june   we were in compliance with all applicable provisions and covenants of the facility  and we met the requirements of the financial covenants by substantial margins 
we currently expect to remain in compliance with the facility s covenants for the foreseeable future 
a default under the facility could accelerate the repayment of any outstanding indebtedness and limit our access to additional credit available under the facility 
such an event could require curtailment of cash dividends or share repurchases  reduce or delay beneficial expansion or investment plans  or otherwise impact our ability to meet our obligations when due 
at june   we were not aware of any event that would constitute a default under the facility 

table of contents we believe that internally generated funds and our existing aggregate balances in cash and equivalents  in addition to our currently available bank credit arrangements  should be adequate to meet our foreseeable cash requirements 
if we were to borrow outside of our credit facility under current market terms  our average interest rate may increase significantly and have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
for additional information regarding our credit facility  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
cash flows year ended june change dollars in thousands vs 
vs 
provided by operating activities used in investing activities used in financing activities our cash flows for the years through are presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
cash flow generated from operations remains the primary source of financing for our internal growth 
cash provided by operating activities in totaled approximately million  an increase of as compared with the prior year total of million  which decreased from the total of million 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities reflected favorable changes in working capital  especially within accounts receivable  inventory and other current assets  as partially offset by the decrease in net income 
the decrease resulted from comparatively unfavorable changes in working capital components  especially inventory  prepaid federal income taxes and receivables  as partially offset by a higher level of net income and comparatively favorable changes in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
most notably  consolidated inventories increased approximately million during primarily as a result of anticipating larger seasonal sales of candles and frozen breads in conversely  despite broadly higher material costs  such inventories declined approximately million in due to a reduced need for building seasonal inventories 
cash used in investing activities totaled approximately million in  million in and million for the increase in cash used in investing activities reflected a higher level of capital expenditures in due to the expansion of our frozen yeast roll facility in kentucky 
the increase in cash used in investing activities reflected lower proceeds from the sale of property and an increase in capital expenditures in capital expenditures totaled approximately million in  compared to million in and million in capital spending allocations during by segment approximated for specialty foods and for glassware and candles 
based on our current plans and expectations  we believe that our total capital expenditures for will be approximately million 
financing activities used net cash totaling approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in cash used in financing activities reflected a higher level of share repurchases  lower proceeds from the exercise of stock awards and a lower cash overdraft balance 
the decrease in cash used in financing activities was due primarily to a decrease in treasury share repurchases  the net change in borrowing activity and an increase in the cash overdraft balance 
the total payment for cash dividends for the year ended june  was approximately million 
the dividend payout rate for was per share as compared to per share during  and per share in this past fiscal year marked the th consecutive year in which our dividend rate was increased 
cash utilized for share repurchases totaled approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
our board approved a share repurchase authorization of  shares in november approximately  shares from this authorization remained authorized for future purchase at june  the future levels of share repurchases and declared dividends are subject to the periodic review of our board and are generally determined after an assessment is made of such factors as anticipated earnings levels  cash flow requirements and general business conditions 
our ongoing business activities continue to be subject to compliance with various laws  rules and regulations as may be issued and enforced by various federal  state and local agencies 
with respect to 
table of contents environmental matters  costs are incurred pertaining to regulatory compliance and  upon occasion  remediation 
such costs have not been  and are not anticipated to become  material 
we are contingently liable with respect to lawsuits  taxes and various other matters that routinely arise in the normal course of business 
except as discussed above  we do not have any related party transactions that materially affect our results of operations  cash flow or financial condition 
off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations and commitments we do not have off balance sheet arrangements  financings  or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons  also known as variable interest entities  that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity or capital expenditures 
we have various contractual obligations that are appropriately recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
certain other items  such as purchase obligations  are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
examples of items not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements are commitments to purchase raw materials or inventory that has not yet been received as of june  and future minimum lease payments for the use of property and equipment under operating lease agreements 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of june  dollars in thousands payment due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years operating lease obligations purchase obligations other noncurrent liabilities as reflected on consolidated balance sheet total operating leases are primarily entered into for warehouse and office facilities and certain equipment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
purchase obligations represent purchase orders and longer term purchase arrangements related to the procurement of raw materials  supplies  and property  plant and equipment 
this amount does not include approximately million of other noncurrent liabilities recorded on the balance sheet  which consist of the underfunded pension liability  other post employment benefit obligations  tax liabilities  noncurrent workers compensation obligations  deferred compensation and interest on deferred compensation 
these items are excluded  as it is not certain when these liabilities will become due 
see notes   and to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
impact of inflation in recent years  we have been exposed to significant fluctuations in certain manufacturing input costs  including materials such as food commodities and paraffin wax 
in  we experienced comparatively higher ingredient costs including for soybean oil  dairy products  sugar  eggs and paraffin wax 
we estimate that higher material costs adversely affected our results by approximately of net sales 
we also experienced higher distribution costs  which were  in part  influenced by higher diesel costs 
for  our overall manufacturing costs reflected favorable improvement over prior years  with the year over year contribution derived from lower materials costs approximating of net sales 
these lower costs occurred primarily in the first half of  with our cost comparisons becoming progressively less favorable as the year progressed 
as noted above  some of this benefit was offset by contractual adjustments existing within certain foodservice pricing arrangements 
entering  we expect higher material and freight costs to persist 

table of contents over the course of and  we were generally able to adjust various selling prices of food products to offset the effects of increased raw material costs 
however  these adjustments generally lagged the increase in our costs  having a net negative impact on our operating margins and a net positive impact in our operating results will also be impacted by our ability to offset any higher input costs through pricing adjustments with our customers 
we do expect to realize higher pricing in  but we believe that the related income may ultimately be less than the total increase from higher material and freight costs 
we also attempt to minimize the exposure to increased costs through our ongoing efforts to achieve greater manufacturing and distribution efficiencies through the improvement of work processes 
critical accounting policies and estimates this md a discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including  but not limited to  those related to accounts receivable  inventories  marketing and distribution costs  asset impairments and self insurance reserves 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
historically  the aggregate differences  if any  between our estimates and actual amounts in any year have typically not had a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
while a summary of our significant accounting policies can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements  we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue upon transfer of title and risk of loss  provided that evidence of an arrangement exists  pricing is fixed or determinable  and collectability is probable 
net sales are recorded net of estimated sales discounts  returns and certain sales incentives  including coupons and rebates 
receivables and the allowance for doubtful accounts we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the aging of accounts receivable balances  historical write off experience and on going reviews of our trade receivables 
measurement of potential losses requires credit review of existing customer relationships  consideration of historical loss experience  including the need to adjust for current conditions  and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data  including present economic conditions such as delinquency rates and the economic health of customers 
in addition to credit concerns  we also evaluate the adequacy of our allowances for customer deductions considering several factors including historical losses and existing customer relationships 
valuation of inventory when necessary  we provide allowances to adjust the carrying value of our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value  including any costs to sell or dispose 
the determination of whether inventory items are slow moving  obsolete or in excess of needs requires estimates about the future demand for our products 
the estimates as to future demand used in the valuation of inventory are subject to the ongoing success of our products and may differ from actual due to such factors as changes in customer and consumer demand 
a decrease in product demand due to changing customer tastes  consumer buying patterns or loss of shelf space to competitors could significantly impact our evaluation of our excess and obsolete inventories 
long lived assets we monitor the recoverability of the carrying value of our long lived assets by periodically considering whether indicators of impairment are present 
if such indicators are present  we determine if the assets are 
table of contents recoverable by comparing the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows to the assets carrying amount 
our cash flows are based on historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions 
if the carrying amounts are greater  then the assets are not recoverable 
in that instance  we compare the carrying amounts to the fair value to determine the amount of the impairment to be recorded 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill is not amortized 
it is evaluated annually at april  through asset impairment testing  as appropriate 
intangible assets with lives restricted by contractual  legal  or other means are amortized over their useful lives 
we periodically evaluate the future economic benefit of the recorded goodwill and intangible assets when events or circumstances indicate potential recoverability concerns 
carrying amounts are adjusted appropriately when determined to have been impaired 
accrued marketing and distribution various marketing programs are offered to customers to reimburse them for a portion or all of their promotional activities related to our products 
additionally  we often incur various costs associated with shipping products to the customer 
we provide accruals for the costs of marketing and distribution based on historical information as may be modified by estimates of actual costs incurred 
actual costs may differ significantly if factors such as the level and success of the customers programs  changes in customer utilization practices  or other conditions differ from expectations 
accruals for self insurance self insurance accruals are made for certain claims associated with employee health care  workers compensation and general liability insurance 
these accruals include estimates that may be based on historical loss development factors 
differences in estimates and assumptions could result in an accrual requirement materially different from the calculated accrual 
accounting for pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans to determine our ultimate obligation under our defined benefit pension plans and our other postretirement benefit plans  we must estimate the future cost of benefits and attribute that cost to the time period during which each covered employee works 
to record the related net assets and obligation of such benefit plans  we use assumptions related to inflation  investment returns  mortality  employee turnover  medical costs and discount rates 
to determine the discount rate  we  along with our third party actuaries  considered several factors  including the june  rates of various bond indices  such as the moody s aa long term bond index  yield curve analysis results from our actuaries based on expected cash flows of our plans  and the past history of discount rates used for the plan valuation 
we  along with our third party actuaries  review all of these assumptions on an ongoing basis to ensure that the most reasonable information available is being considered 
changes in assumptions and future investment returns could potentially have a material impact on pension expense and related funding requirements 
we recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of our defined benefit plans as an asset or liability in our consolidated balance sheet 
any changes in that funded status caused by subsequent plan revaluations are recognized through comprehensive income 
we may also experience future plan settlements or curtailments having unanticipated effects on operating results 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 comprehensive income presentation of comprehensive income asu 
this asu amends current comprehensive income guidance to eliminate the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of shareholders equity 
instead  it requires entities to report components of comprehensive income in either a continuous statement of comprehensive income or two separate but consecutive statements 
asu will be effective for public companies during the interim and annual periods beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
we do not expect the adoption of this update to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 

table of contents recently adopted accounting standards effective july   we adopted the provisions of a fasb fsp on the fasb s eitf issue no 
 determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities  which is now part of accounting standards codification asc topic  earnings per share 
this fsp addresses whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities prior to vesting  and therefore need to be included in the earnings allocation in computing earnings per share eps under the two class method 
the restricted stock we previously granted to employees was deemed to meet the definition of a participating security as the employees receive nonforfeitable dividends before the stock becomes vested 
our adoption of this fsp required that we retrospectively restate eps and diluted weighted average common shares outstanding for all periods presented 
this resulted in a 
reduction in basic and diluted net income per common share for see further discussion in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in  we adopted fsp no 
fas r  employers disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets fsp fas r  which is now part of asc topic  compensation retirement benefits 
fsp fas r provides guidance on an employer s disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan 
this fsp expands the disclosure for retirement benefits by adding required disclosures about how investment allocation decisions are made by management  major categories of plan assets  and significant concentration of risk 
additionally  the fsp requires an employer to disclose information about the valuation of plan assets similar to that required for fair value measurements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have exposure to market risks primarily from changes in interest rates and ingredient prices 
we have not had exposure to market risk associated with derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments 
interest rate risk we are subject to interest rate risk primarily associated with our borrowings 
interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates could adversely affect earnings and cash flows 
rates under our credit facility are set at the time of each borrowing and are based on predetermined formulas connected to certain benchmark rates 
increases in these rates could have an adverse impact on our earnings and cash flows 
at the end of  we had no borrowings outstanding under our credit facility 
the nature and amount of our borrowings may vary as a result of business requirements  acquisitions  market conditions and other factors 
commodity price risk we purchase a variety of commodities and other materials  such as soybean oil  flour  wax and packaging materials  which we use to manufacture our products 
the market prices for these commodities are subject to fluctuation based upon a number of economic factors and may become volatile at times 
while we do not use any derivative commodity instruments to hedge against commodity price risk  we do actively

this program gives us more predictable input costs  which may help stabilize our margins during periods of volatility in commodity markets
