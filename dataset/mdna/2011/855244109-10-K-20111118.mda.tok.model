overview starbucks results for fiscal reflect the strength and resiliency of our business model  the global power of our brand and the talent and dedication of our employees 
our business has performed well this year despite significant headwinds from commodity costs and a continuingly challenging consumer environment 
strong global comparable stores sales growth of for the full year us and international drove increased sales leverage and resulted in higher operating margins and net earnings 
this helped mitigate the impact of higher commodity costs  which negatively impacted eps by approximately per share for the year  equivalent to approximately basis points of operating margin 
most of the commodity pressure was related to coffee  with dairy  cocoa  sugar and fuel accounting for the rest 
our us business continued its strong momentum and contributed of total net revenues in fiscal we saw benefits from a variety of initiatives including our loyalty program  innovative products such as our starbucks petites platform and other new food and beverage options 
we also continued to refine our store efficiency efforts  including the rollout of our new point of sale and inventory management systems in our company operated stores 
the combination of these efforts resulted in strong comparable store sales of  which translated to an increase in sales leverage  which more than offset the effect of higher commodity costs 
our international portfolio  which contributed of total net revenues in fiscal  continues to improve  with an operating margin of for the year 
we continue to leverage the valuable lessons learned from the turnaround of our us business  and continue to make progress on scaling the infrastructure of this segment 
we are aggressively pursuing the profitable expansion opportunities that exist outside the us  including disciplined growth and scale in our more mature markets  and faster expansion in key emerging markets like china 
our global consumer products group cpg represents another important profitable growth opportunity for us 
during the second quarter  we successfully transitioned our packaged coffee and tea businesses to an in house direct model  away from the previous distribution arrangement 
this model now gives us total control over the sell in and distribution to retailers of these products 
we also aggressively pursued the opportunities beyond our more 
table of contents traditional store experience to offer consumers new coffee and other products in multiple forms  across new categories  and through diverse channels  leveraging our strong brand and established retail store base 
examples include the ongoing global expansion of our successful starbucks via ready brew product and starbucks and tazo branded k cup portion packs which were added to the lineup at the start of fiscal cpg contributed of total net revenues in fiscal looking toward the future  we recently announced a reorganization of our leadership structure that took effect at the beginning of fiscal the new structure will enable us to accelerate our global  multi brand  multi channel strategy  and to leverage the talent  experience and expertise resident in our senior leadership team 
in this new structure  one president will oversee all operations within each of three distinct regions with responsibility for the performance of company operated stores  as well as for working with licensed and joint venture business partners in each market within their respective region 
the region president will also be responsible for working with starbucks global consumer products and foodservice teams to further develop those businesses and execute against our growth plan within the region 
the three new regions will be americas  inclusive of the us  canada  and latin america  china and asia pacific  and europe  middle east  and africa  collectively referred to as the emea region 
fiscal the view ahead for fiscal year  we expect moderate revenue growth driven by mid single digit increased comparable store sales  new store openings and strong growth in the cpg business 
licensed stores will comprise between one half and two thirds of new store openings in the americas  emea and china and asia pacific regions 
we expect modest consolidated operating margin and eps improvement compared to fiscal  given our current revenue expectations  along with ongoing spend related to our expanding cpg in house direct distribution model and higher commodity costs 
we expect increased capital expenditures in fiscal compared to fiscal  reflecting additional investments in store renovations and in manufacturing capacity 
operating segment overview through the end of fiscal  starbucks had three reportable operating segments us  international  and cpg 
our seattle s best coffee operating segment is reported in other  along with our digital ventures business and unallocated corporate expenses that pertain to corporate administrative functions that support our operating segments but are not specifically attributable to or managed by any segment and are not included in the reported financial results of the operating segments 
the us and international segments both include company operated stores and licensed retail stores 
licensed stores generally have a higher operating margin than company operated stores 
under the licensed model  starbucks receives a reduced share of the total store revenues  but this is more than offset by the reduction in its share of costs as these are primarily borne by the licensee 
the international segment has a higher relative share of licensed stores versus company operated stores compared to the us segment  however  the us segment has been operating significantly longer than the international segment and has developed deeper awareness of  and attachment to  the starbucks brand and stores among its customer base 
as a result  the more mature us segment has significantly more stores  and higher total revenues than the international segment 
average sales per store are also higher in the us due to various factors including length of time in market and local income levels 
further  certain market costs  particularly occupancy costs  are lower in the us segment compared to the average for the international segment  which comprise a more diverse group of operations 
as a result of the relative strength of the brand in the us segment  the number of stores  the higher unit volumes  and the lower market costs  the us segment  despite its higher relative percentage of company operated stores  has a higher operating margin than the less developed international segment 
starbucks international store base continues to expand and we continue to focus on achieving sustainable growth from established international markets while at the same time investing in emerging markets  such as china 
newer 
table of contents international markets require a more extensive support organization  relative to the current levels of revenue and operating income 
the cpg and seattle s best coffee segments include packaged coffee and tea and other branded products operations worldwide  as well as the us foodservice business 
in prior years through the first several months of fiscal  we sold a selection of starbucks and seattle s best coffee branded packaged coffees and tazo teas in grocery and warehouse club stores throughout the us and to grocery stores in canada  the uk and other european countries through a distribution arrangement with kraft foods global  inc kraft managed the distribution  marketing  advertising and promotion of these products as a part of that arrangement 
beginning in the second quarter of fiscal  we successfully transitioned these businesses including the marketing  advertising  and promotion of these products  from our previous distribution arrangement with kraft and began selling these products directly to the grocery and warehouse club stores 
our cpg segment also includes ready to drink beverages  which are primarily manufactured and distributed through the north american coffee partnership  a joint venture with the pepsi cola company 
the proportionate share of the results of the joint venture is included  on a net basis  in income from equity investees on the consolidated statements of earnings 
the us foodservice business sells coffee and other related products to institutional foodservice companies with the majority of its sales through national broad line distribution networks 
the cpg segment reflects relatively lower revenues  a modest cost structure  and a resulting higher operating margin  compared to the other two reporting segments  which consist primarily of retail stores 
acquisitions see note to the consolidated financial statements in this k

as of october   approximately million of cash was held in foreign subsidiaries 
of our cash held in foreign subsidiaries  million is denominated in the us dollar 
we actively manage our cash and short term investments in order to internally fund operating needs domestically and internationally  make scheduled interest and principal payments on our borrowings  and return cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and share repurchases 
our short term investments consisted predominantly of us treasury securities  commercial paper  corporate bonds  and us agency securities 
also included in our short term investment portfolio are certificates of deposit placed through an account registry service cdars  with maturities ranging from days to one year  which we began investing into during the fourth quarter of fiscal year the principal amounts of the individual certificates of deposit do not exceed the federal deposit insurance corporation limits 
our portfolio of long term available for sale securities consists predominantly of high investment grade corporate bonds  diversified among industries and individual issuers  as well as certificates of deposits placed through cdars with maturities greater than year 
we also have investments in auction rate securities ars  all of which are classified as long term 
ars totaling million and million were outstanding as of october  and october   respectively 
the reduction in ars was due to million in redemptions during the fiscal year  with all redemptions done at par 
while the ongoing auction failures will limit the liquidity of these ars investments for some period of time  we do not believe this will materially impact our ability to fund our working capital needs  capital expenditures  shareholder dividends or other business requirements 
borrowing capacity starbucks previous billion unsecured credit facility the credit facility was available through november of  when we replaced the credit facility with a new million unsecured credit facility the credit facility with various banks  of which million may be used for issuances of letters of credit

the interest rate for any borrowings under the credit facility  based on starbucks current ratings and fixed charge coverage ratio  is over libor 
the specific spread over libor will depend upon 
table of contents our long term credit ratings assigned by moody s and standard poor s rating agencies and our fixed charge coverage ratio 
as with the credit facility  the credit facility contains provisions requiring us to maintain compliance with certain covenants  including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  which measures our ability to cover financing expenses 
as of october  and october   we were in compliance with each of these covenants 
under starbucks commercial paper program we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes  up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of million  with individual maturities that may vary  but not exceed days from the date of issue 
the program is backstopped by the credit facility  and the combined borrowing limit is million for the commercial paper program and the credit facility 
starbucks may issue commercial paper from time to time  and the proceeds of the commercial paper financing will be used for working capital needs  capital expenditures and other corporate purposes  including acquisitions and share repurchases 
the credit facility was also paired with a commercial paper program whereby we could issue unsecured commercial paper notes  up to a maximum amount outstanding at any time of billion

use of cash we expect to use our cash and short term investments  including any potential future borrowings under the credit facility and commercial paper program  to invest in our core businesses  including new product innovations and related marketing support  as well as other new business opportunities related to our core businesses 
we believe that future cash flows generated from operations and existing cash and short term investments both domestically and internationally will be sufficient to finance capital requirements for our core businesses in those respective markets as well as shareholder distributions for the foreseeable future 
however  in the event that we need to repatriate all or a portion of our international cash to the us we would be subject to additional us income taxes 
we may use our available cash resources to make proportionate capital contributions to our equity method and cost method investees 
we may also seek strategic acquisitions to leverage existing capabilities and further build our business in support of our growth agenda 
acquisitions may include increasing our ownership interests in our equity method and cost method investees 
any decisions to increase such ownership interests will be driven by valuation and fit with our ownership strategy 
significant new joint ventures  acquisitions and or other new business opportunities may require additional outside funding 
other than normal operating expenses  cash requirements for fiscal are expected to consist primarily of capital expenditures for remodeling and refurbishment of  and equipment upgrades for  existing company operated stores  systems and technology investments in the stores and in the support infrastructure  new company operated stores  and additional investments in manufacturing capacity

table of contents cash flows cash provided by operating activities was billion for fiscal year  compared to billion for fiscal year the slight decrease was primarily attributable to an increase in inventories  resulting in part from higher coffee prices  partially offset by higher net earnings for the period and an increase in payables  primarily related to green coffee purchases 
cash used by investing activities for fiscal year totaled billion  compared to million for fiscal year the increase was primarily due to increased purchases of available for sale securities and increased capital expenditures for remodeling and renovating existing company operated stores  opening new retail stores and investments in information technology systems 
the increase was partially offset by increased maturities and calls of available for sale securities and cash proceeds from the sale of corporate real estate during the year 
cash used by financing activities for fiscal year totaled million  compared to million for fiscal year the increase was primarily due to an increase in cash returned to shareholders through dividend payments and common share repurchases in fiscal the increase was partially offset by increased proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the related excess tax benefits  resulting from more stock option exercises during the period

table of contents commodity prices  availability and general risk conditions commodity price risk represents starbucks primary market risk  generated by our purchases of green coffee and dairy products  among other things 
we purchase  roast and sell high quality whole bean arabica coffee and related products and risk arises from the price volatility of green coffee 
in addition to coffee  we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products to support the needs of our company operated stores 
the price and availability of these commodities directly impacts our results of operations and can be expected to impact our future results of operations 
for additional details see product supply in item  as well as risk factors in item a of this k 
financial risk management market risk is defined as the risk of losses due to changes in commodity prices  foreign currency exchange rates  equity security prices  and interest rates 
we manage our exposure to various market based risks according to an umbrella risk management policy 
under this policy  market based risks are quantified and evaluated for potential mitigation strategies  such as entering into hedging transactions 
the umbrella risk management policy governs the hedging instruments the business may use and limits the risk to net earnings 
we also monitor and limit the amount of associated counterparty credit risk 
additionally  this policy restricts  among other things  the amount of market based risk we will tolerate before implementing approved hedging strategies and prohibits speculative trading activity 
in general  hedging instruments do not have maturities in excess of five years 
the sensitivity analyses disclosed below provide only a limited  point in time view of the market risk of the financial instruments discussed 
the actual impact of the respective underlying rates and price changes on the financial instruments may differ significantly from those shown in the sensitivity analyses 
commodity price risk we purchase commodity inputs  including coffee  dairy products and diesel that are used in our operations and are subject to price fluctuations that impact our financial results 
in addition to fixed price and price to be fixed contracts for coffee purchases  we have entered into commodity hedges to manage commodity price risk using financial derivative instruments 
we performed a sensitivity analysis based on a change in the underlying commodity prices of our commodity hedges  as of october   and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments 
foreign currency exchange risk the majority of our revenue  expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars 
however  because a portion of our operations consists of activities outside of the us  we have transactions in other currencies  primarily the canadian dollar  british pound  euro  and japanese yen 
as a result  we may engage in transactions involving various derivative instruments to hedge revenues  inventory purchases  assets  and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
as of october   we had forward foreign exchange contracts that hedge portions of anticipated international revenue streams and inventory purchases 
in addition  we had forward foreign exchange contracts that qualify as accounting hedges of our net investment in starbucks japan to minimize foreign currency exposure 
starbucks also had forward foreign exchange contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes free standing derivatives  but which largely offset the financial impact of translating certain foreign currency denominated payables and receivables 
increases or decreases in the fair value of these derivatives are generally offset by corresponding decreases or increases in the us dollar value of our foreign currency denominated payables and receivables ie hedged items that would occur within the period 

table of contents the following table summarizes the potential impact as of october  to starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income oci from changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments due in turn to a change in the value of the us dollar as compared to the level of foreign exchange rates 
the information provided below relates only to the hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items in millions increase decrease to net earnings increase decrease to oci increase in underlying rate decrease in underlying rate increase in underlying rate decrease in underlying rate foreign currency hedges equity security price risk we have minimal exposure to price fluctuations on equity mutual funds and equity exchange traded funds within our trading portfolio 
the trading securities approximate a portion of our liability under the management deferred compensation plan mdcp 
a corresponding liability is included in accrued compensation and related costs on the consolidated balance sheets 
these investments are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized in net interest income and other in the consolidated statements of earnings 
the offsetting changes in the mdcp liability are recorded in general and administrative expenses 
we performed a sensitivity analysis based on a change in the underlying equity prices of our investments as of october  and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments 
interest rate risk we utilize short term and long term financing and may use interest rate hedges to manage the effect of interest rate changes on our existing debt as well as the anticipated issuance of new debt 
as of october  and october   we did not have any interest rate hedge agreements outstanding

application of critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that management believes are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 

table of contents we consider financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and or complexity asset impairment when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of long lived assets may not be recoverable  we evaluate long lived assets for impairment 
we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated future undiscounted cash flows 
if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset  we measure an impairment loss based on the asset s estimated fair value 
for retail assets  the impairment test is performed at the individual store asset group level 
the fair value of a store s assets is estimated using a discounted cash flow model based on internal projections 
key assumptions used in this calculation include revenue growth  operating expenses and a discount rate that we believe a buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the store 
estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections and consider a store s historical performance  local market economics and the business environment impacting the store s performance 
these estimates are subjective and can be significantly impacted by changes in the business or economic conditions 
for non retail assets  fair value is determined using an approach that is appropriate based on the relevant facts and circumstances  which may include discounted cash flows  comparable transactions  or comparable company analyses 
our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values  including forecasting asset useful lives 
further  our ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying values of our assets is affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvement of the assets  changes in economic conditions  and changes in operating performance 
during the past three fiscal years  we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology that we use to assess long lived asset impairment loss 
for the foreseeable future  we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions that we use to calculate long lived asset impairment losses 
however  as we periodically reassess estimated future cash flows and asset fair values  changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future 
goodwill impairment we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis during our third fiscal quarter  or more frequently if circumstances  such as material deterioration in performance or a significant number of store closures  indicate reporting unit carrying values may exceed their fair values 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied estimated fair value  an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the carrying value to the implied estimated fair value 
the fair value of our reporting units is the price a willing buyer would pay for the reporting unit and is typically calculated using a discounted cash flow model 
key assumptions used in this calculation include revenue growth  operating expenses and discount rate that we believe a buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the reporting unit 
estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections considering a reporting unit s past performance and forecasted growth  local market economics and the local business environment impacting the reporting unit s performance 
the discount rate is calculated using an estimated cost of capital for a retail operator to operate the reporting unit in the region 
these estimates are highly subjective judgments and can be significantly impacted by changes in the business or economic conditions 
our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the fair value of our reporting units  including estimating future cash flows  and if necessary  the fair value of a reporting units assets and liabilities 
further  our ability to realize the future cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as changes in economic conditions  changes in our operating performance  and changes in our business strategies 

table of contents as a part of our ongoing operations  we may close certain stores within a reporting unit containing goodwill due to underperformance of the store or inability to renew our lease  among other reasons 
we abandon certain assets associated with a closed store including leasehold improvements and other non transferrable assets 
under gaap  when a portion of a reporting unit that constitutes a business is to be disposed of  goodwill associated with the business is included in the carrying amount of the business in determining any loss on disposal 
our evaluation of whether the portion of a reporting unit being disposed of constitutes a business occurs on the date of abandonment 
although an operating store meets the accounting definition of a business prior to abandonment  it does not constitute a business on the closure date because the remaining assets on that date do not constitute an integrated set of assets that are capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors 
as a result  when closing individual stores  we do not include goodwill in the calculation of any loss on disposal of the related assets 
as noted above  if store closures are indicative of potential impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit level  we perform an evaluation of our reporting unit goodwill when such closures occur 
during the past three fiscal years  we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology that we use to assess goodwill impairment loss 
for fiscal  we determined the fair value of our reporting units was substantially in excess of their carrying values 
accordingly  we did not recognize any goodwill impairments during the current fiscal year 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions that we use to test for impairment losses on goodwill in the foreseeable future 
however  as we periodically reassess our fair value calculations  including estimated future cash flows  changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future 
stock based compensation we measure the fair value of stock awards at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize the expense over the related service period 
for stock option awards we use the black scholes merton option pricing model which requires the input of subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their stock options before exercising them expected term  the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term and the expected dividend yield 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those stock awards expected to vest 
we estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience 
changes in our assumptions could materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions that we use to calculate stock based compensation expense for the foreseeable future 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to changes in stock based compensation expense that could be material in the future 
for fiscal  a change in our critical assumptions  including volatility and expected term  would have changed stock based compensation expense by approximately million for fiscal operating leases we lease retail stores  roasting and distribution facilities and office space under operating leases 
we provide for an estimate of our asset retirement obligation aro at the lease inception date for operating leases with requirements to remove leasehold improvements at the end of the lease term 
our estimates of aros involve assumptions regarding both the amount and timing of actual future retirement costs 
the initial aro asset and liability represent the present value of the estimated future costs to complete the required work 
the aro asset is depreciated over the same timeframe as the associate leasehold improvements  and the liability is accreted over time 
future actual costs could differ significantly from amounts initially estimated 
we occasionally vacate stores and other locations prior to the expiration of the related lease 
for vacated locations with remaining lease commitments  we record an expense for the difference between the present value of our future lease payments and related costs eg  real estate taxes and common area maintenance from the date of closure through the end of the remaining lease term  net of expected future sublease rental income 
key assumptions in our 
table of contents estimate of future cash flows include estimated sublease income and lease termination costs 
these estimates are based on historical experience  our analysis of the specific real estate market  including input from independent real estate firms  and economic conditions that can be difficult to predict 
cash flows are discounted using a rate that coincides with the remaining lease term 
the liability recorded for location closures contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the duration of future vacancy periods  the amount and timing of future settlement payments  and the amount and timing of potential sublease rental income 
during the past three fiscal years  we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology that we use to calculate our lease abandonment accrual 
for the foreseeable future  we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions that we use to calculate our lease abandonment accrual 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
a change in our key assumptions for our lease abandonment accrual at october   would not have had a significant impact on net earnings for fiscal self insurance reserves we use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms  including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance treaty  to provide for the potential liabilities for certain risks  including workers compensation  healthcare benefits  general liability  property insurance  and director and officers liability insurance 
key assumptions used in the estimate of our self insurance reserves include the amount of claims incurred but not reported at the balance sheet date 
these liabilities  which are associated with the risks that are retained by starbucks are not discounted and are estimated  in part  by considering historical claims experience  demographic  exposure and severity factors  and other actuarial assumptions 
the estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends 
our self insured liabilities contain uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not reported at the balance sheet date 
periodically  we review our assumptions to determine the adequacy of our self insured liabilities 
during the past three fiscal years  we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology that we use to calculate our self insurance liabilities 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions that we use to calculate our self insurance liabilities for the foreseeable future 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
a change in our self insurance reserves at october  would have affected net earnings by approximately million in fiscal income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax bases of our assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to reverse 
we routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if  based on all available evidence  we determine that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized 
in addition  our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities 
these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions  including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
we evaluate our exposures associated with our various tax filing positions and record a related liability 
we adjust our liability for unrecognized tax benefits and income tax provision in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively settled  the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position  or when more information becomes available 

table of contents deferred tax asset valuation allowances and our liability for unrecognized tax benefits require significant management judgment regarding applicable statutes and their related interpretation  the status of various income tax audits  and our particular facts and circumstances 
although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable  actual results could differ  and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established  or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability  our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected 
litigation accruals we are involved in various claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business 
legal and other contingency reserves and related disclosures are based on our assessment of the likelihood of a potential loss and our ability to estimate the loss or range of loss  which includes consultation with outside legal counsel and advisors 
we record reserves related to legal matters when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the range of such loss can be reasonably estimated 
such assessments are reviewed each period and revised  based on current facts and circumstances and historical experience with similar claims  as necessary 
our disclosures of and accruals for litigation claims  if any  contain uncertainties because management is required to use judgment to estimate the probability of a loss and a range of possible losses related to each claim 
footnote to the consolidated financial statements describes the company s legal and other contingent liability matters 
as we periodically review our assessments of litigation accruals  we may change our assumptions with respect to loss probabilities and ranges of potential losses 
any changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on our future results of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements in this k for a detailed description of recent accounting pronouncements 
we do not expect these recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a material impact on our results of operations  financial condition  or liquidity in future periods
