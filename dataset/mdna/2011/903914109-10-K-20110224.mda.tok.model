overview ultra petroleum corp 
is an independent exploration and production company focused on developing its long life natural gas reserves in the green river basin of wyoming the pinedale and jonah fields and is in the early exploration and development stages in the appalachian basin of pennsylvania 
the company operates in one industry segment  natural gas and oil exploration and development  with one geographical segment  the united states 
the company currently conducts operations exclusively in the united states 
substantially all of its oil and natural gas activities are conducted jointly with others and  accordingly  amounts presented reflect only the company s proportionate interest in such activities 
inflation has not had a material impact on the company s results of operations and is not expected to have a material impact on the company s results of operations in the future 
the company currently generates its revenue  earnings and cash flow primarily from the production and sales of natural gas and condensate from its property in southwest wyoming 
an increasing portion of the company s revenues is associated with gas sales from wells located in the appalachian basin in pennsylvania 
the price of natural gas is a critical factor to the company s business and the price of natural gas has historically been volatile 
volatility could be detrimental to the company s financial performance 
the company seeks to limit the impact of this volatility on its results by entering into swap agreements and or fixed price forward physical delivery contracts for natural gas 
the average price realization for the company s natural gas during was per mcf  including realized gains and losses on commodity derivatives 
during the quarter ended december   the average price realization for the company s natural gas was per mcf  including realized gains and losses on commodity derivatives 
the company s average price realization for natural gas  
table of contents excluding realized gains and losses on commodity derivatives  was per mcf and per mcf for the year and quarter ended december   respectively

critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations is based upon consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
in addition  application of gaap requires the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the revenues and expenses reported during the period 
changes in these estimates related to judgments and assumptions will occur as a result of future events  and  accordingly  actual results could differ from amounts estimated 
set forth below is a discussion of the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements which we believe involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
oil and gas reserves 
on january   the fasb issued an accounting standards update asu updating oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure requirements 
the asu amends fasb asc to align the reserve calculation and disclosure requirements with the requirements in sec release no 
sec release no 
 amends oil and gas reporting requirements under rule of regulation s x and industry guide in regulation s k revising oil and gas reserves estimation and disclosure requirements 
the rules include changes to pricing used to estimate reserves  the ability to include non traditional resources in reserves  the use of new technology for determining reserves and permitting disclosure of probable and possible reserves 
the primary objectives of the revisions are to increase the transparency and information value of reserve disclosures and improve comparability among oil and gas companies 
accordingly  the company adopted the update to fasb asc as of december  in accordance with our three year planning and budgeting cycle  proved undeveloped reserves included in the current  as well as previous reserve estimates  include only economic well locations that are forecast to be drilled within a three year period 
as a result of our self imposed three year limit on proved undeveloped reserves inventory  we have not booked any proved undeveloped reserves beyond five years 
as a result  it is the company s opinion that the proved reserves included in this report would not be significantly different if they were filed under the previous guidelines 
the company utilizes reliable technology such as seismic data and interpretation  wireline formation tests  geophysical logs and core data to assess its resources 
however  none of these technologies have contributed to a material addition to the proved reserves in this report 
the proved reserves estimates are prepared by netherland  sewell and associates  an independent  third party engineering firm 
estimates of proved crude oil and natural gas reserves significantly affect the company s depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a expense 
for example  if estimates of proved reserves decline  the company s dd a rate will increase  resulting in a decrease in net income 
a decline in estimates of proved reserves may result from a number of factors including lower prices  evaluation of additional operating history  mechanical problems on our wells and catastrophic events 
lower prices also make it uneconomical to drill wells or produce from fields with high operating costs 

table of contents our proved reserves are a function of many assumptions  all of which could deviate materially from actual results 
as a result  our estimates of proved reserves could vary over time  and could vary from actual results 
full cost method of accounting 
the accounting for and disclosure of oil and gas producing activities requires that we choose between gaap alternatives 
the company uses the full cost method of accounting for its oil and natural gas operations 
under this method  separate cost centers are maintained for each country in which the company incurs costs 
all costs incurred in the acquisition  exploration and development of properties including costs of surrendered and abandoned leaseholds  delay lease rentals  dry holes and overhead related to exploration and development activities are capitalized 
the sum of net capitalized costs and estimated future development costs of oil and natural gas properties for each full cost center are depleted using the units of production method 
changes in estimates of proved reserves  future development costs or asset retirement obligations are accounted for prospectively in our depletion calculation 
under the full cost method  costs of unevaluated properties and major development projects expected to require significant future costs may be excluded from capitalized costs being amortized 
the company excludes significant costs until proved reserves are found or until it is determined that the costs are impaired 
excluded costs  if any  are reviewed quarterly to determine if impairment has occurred 
the amount of any impairment is transferred to the capitalized costs being amortized in the appropriate full cost pool 
companies that use the full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas exploration and development activities are required to perform a ceiling test calculation each quarter 
the full cost ceiling test is an impairment test prescribed by sec regulation s x rule the ceiling test is performed quarterly  on a country by country basis  utilizing the average of prices in effect on the first day of the month for the preceding twelve month period 
the ceiling limits such pooled costs to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues attributable to proved crude oil and natural gas reserves discounted at plus the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties less any associated tax effects 
if such capitalized costs exceed the ceiling  the company will record a write down to the extent of such excess as a non cash charge to earnings 
any such write down will reduce earnings in the period of occurrence and result in lower dd a expense in future periods 
a write down may not be reversed in future periods even though higher oil and natural gas prices may subsequently increase the ceiling 
during the first quarter of  the company recorded a billion million net of tax non cash write down of the carrying value of the company s proved oil and gas properties as of march   as a result of the ceiling test limitation  which is reflected as write down of proved oil and gas properties in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the company did not have any write downs related to the full cost ceiling limitation in or asset retirement obligation 
the company s asset retirement obligations aro consist primarily of estimated costs of dismantlement  removal  site reclamation and similar activities associated with its oil and natural gas properties 
fasb asc topic  asset retirement and environmental obligations fasb asc requires that the discounted fair value of a liability for an aro be recognized in the period in which it is incurred with the associated asset retirement cost capitalized as part of the carrying cost of the oil and natural gas asset 
the recognition of an aro requires that management make numerous estimates  assumptions and judgments regarding such factors as the existence of a legal obligation for an aro  estimated probabilities  amounts and timing of settlements  the credit adjusted  risk free rate to be used  inflation rates  and future advances in technology 
in periods subsequent to initial measurement of the aro  the company must recognize period to period changes in the liability resulting from the passage of time and revisions to either the timing or the amount of the original estimate of undiscounted cash flows 
increases in the aro liability due to passage of time impact net income as accretion expense 
the related capitalized costs  including revisions thereto  are charged to expense through dd a 
entitlements method of accounting for oil and natural gas sales 
the company generally sells natural gas and condensate under both long term and short term agreements at prevailing market prices and under multi year contracts that provide for a fixed price of oil and natural gas 
the company recognizes revenues when the oil and natural gas is delivered  which occurs when the customer has taken title and has assumed the risks and rewards of ownership  prices are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
the company accounts for oil and natural gas sales using the entitlements method 
under the entitlements method  revenue is recorded based 
table of contents upon the company s ownership share of volumes sold  regardless of whether it has taken its ownership share of such volumes 
the company records a receivable or a liability to the extent it receives less or more than its share of the volumes and related revenue 
make up provisions and ultimate settlements of volume imbalances are generally governed by agreements between the company and its partners with respect to specific properties or  in the absence of such agreements  through negotiation 
the value of volumes over or under produced can change based on changes in commodity prices 
the company prefers the entitlements method of accounting for oil and natural gas sales because it allows for recognition of revenue based on its actual share of jointly owned production  results in better matching of revenue with related operating expenses  and provides balance sheet recognition of the estimated value of product imbalances 
valuation of deferred tax assets 
the company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  future income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial statement carrying values and their respective income tax basis temporary differences 
to assess the realization of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
derivative instruments and hedging activities 
currently  the company largely relies on commodity derivative contracts generally  financial swaps to manage its exposure to commodity price risk 
additionally  and from time to time  the company enters into physical  fixed price forward natural gas sales in order to mitigate its commodity price exposure on a portion of its natural gas production 
these fixed price forward gas sales are considered normal sales in the ordinary course of business and outside the scope of fasb asc topic  derivatives and hedging fasb asc 
effective november   the company changed its method of accounting for natural gas commodity derivatives to reflect unrealized gains and losses on commodity derivative contracts in the income statement rather than on the balance sheet 
the company previously followed hedge accounting for its natural gas hedges 
under this prior accounting method  the unrealized gain or loss on qualifying cash flow hedges calculated on a mark to market basis  net of tax was recorded on the balance sheet in stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
when an unrealized hedging gain or loss was realized upon contract expiration  it was reclassified into earnings through inclusion in natural gas sales revenues 
the company continues to record the fair value of its commodity derivatives as an asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheets  but records the changes in the fair value of its commodity derivatives in the consolidated statements of operations as an unrealized gain or loss on commodity derivatives 
there was no resulting effect on overall cash flow  total assets  total liabilities or total stockholders equity see note 
fair value measurements 
the company follows fasb asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures fasb asc under fasb asc  fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at measurement date and establishes a three level hierarchy for measuring fair value 
the valuation assumptions utilized to measure the fair value of the company s commodity derivatives were observable inputs based on market data obtained from independent sources and are considered level inputs quoted prices for similar assets  liabilities adjusted and market corroborated inputs 
see note for additional information 
in consideration of counterparty credit risk  the company assessed the possibility of whether each counterparty to the derivative would default by failing to make any contractually required payments as scheduled in the derivative instrument in determining the fair value 
additionally  the company considers that it is of substantial credit quality and has the financial resources and willingness to meet its potential repayment obligations associated with the derivative transactions 
the fair values summarized below were determined in accordance with the requirements of fasb asc and we aligned the categories below with the level   and fair value measurements as defined by fasb 
table of contents asc the balance of net unrealized gains and losses recognized for our energy related derivative instruments at december  is summarized in the following table based on the inputs used to determine fair value level a level b level c total assets current derivative asset long term derivative asset liabilities current derivative liability long term derivative liability a values represent observable unadjusted quoted prices for traded instruments in active markets 
b values with inputs that are observable directly or indirectly for the instrument  but do not qualify for level c values with a significant amount of inputs that are not observable for the instrument 
legal  environmental and other contingencies 
a provision for legal  environmental and other contingencies is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
determining when expenses should be recorded for these contingencies and the appropriate amounts for accrual is a complex estimation process that includes the subjective judgment of management 
in many cases  management s judgment is based on interpretation of laws and regulations  which can be interpreted differently by regulators and or courts of law 
the company s management closely monitors known and potential legal  environmental and other contingencies and periodically determines when the company should record losses for these items based on information available to the company 
share based payment arrangements 
the company follows fasb asc topic  compensation stock compensation fasb asc which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors  including employee stock options  based on estimated fair values 
share based compensation expense recognized under fasb asc for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively

operating activities 
during the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was million  a increase from million for the same period in the increase in net cash provided by operating activities was largely attributable to increased production during the year ended december  as compared to the same period in investing activities 
during the year ended december   net cash used in investing activities was billion as compared to million for the same period in the increase in net cash used in investing activities is largely due to increased capital investments associated with the company s drilling activities in as compared to as well as the increased investments associated with the pennsylvania marcellus shale acquisition in and partially offset by the timing of payments associated with capital costs incurred during one year and paid during the following year 
financing activities 
during the year ended december   net cash provided by financing activities was million as compared to million for the same period in the increase in cash provided by net financing activities is largely due to increased borrowings  primarily attributable to the senior notes offerings totaling approximately billion during as compared to outlook we believe we are well positioned for the current economic environment because of our status as a low cost operator in the industry combined with our financial flexibility 
in  the company established new production records while maintaining a low cost structure which contributes to the consistency of the company s returns and growth 
although our net cash provided by operating activities was negatively affected by continued low natural gas prices  we believe that we will continue to generate positive cash flow from operations  which  along with our available cash  will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our capital investments and operations over the next twelve months 
we expect to rely on our available cash  our existing credit facility and the cash we generate from our operations to meet our obligations 
while we continue to monitor the overall health of the credit markets  a renewed  long term disruption in the credit markets could make financing more expensive or unavailable  which could have a material adverse effect on our operations

the company is an anchor shipper on rex securing pipeline infrastructure providing sufficient capacity to transport a portion of its natural gas production away from southwest wyoming and to provide for reasonable basis differentials for its natural gas in the future 
rex begins at the opal processing plant in southwest wyoming and traverses wyoming and several other states to an ultimate terminus in eastern ohio 
the company s commitment involves a capacity of mmmbtu per day of natural gas for a term of years commencing in november  and the company is obligated to pay rex certain demand charges related to its rights to hold this firm transportation capacity as an anchor shipper 
during the first quarter of  the company entered into agreements to secure an additional capacity of mmmbtu per day on the rex pipeline system  beginning in january through december this additional capacity will provide the company with the ability to move additional volumes from its producing wells in wyoming to markets in the eastern us drilling contracts

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk objectives and strategy the company s major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to its natural gas and oil production 
realized pricing is currently driven primarily by the prevailing price for the company s wyoming natural gas production 
historically  prices received for natural gas production have been volatile and unpredictable 
pricing volatility is expected to continue 
the company relies on various types of derivative instruments to manage its exposure to commodity price risk and to provide a level of certainty in the company s forward cash flows supporting the company s capital investment program 
the company s hedging policy limits the amounts of resources hedged to not more than of its forecast production without board approval 
as a result of its hedging activities  the company may realize prices that are less than or greater than the spot prices that it would have received otherwise 
commodity derivative contracts during the first quarter of  the company converted its physical  fixed price  forward natural gas sales to physical  indexed natural gas sales combined with financial swaps whereby the company receives the fixed price and pays the variable price 
this change provided operational flexibility to curtail gas production in the event of declines in natural gas prices 
the contracts were converted at no cost to the company and the conversion of these contracts to derivative instruments was effective upon entering into these transactions in march  with settlements for production months through december the natural gas
