aps operates the plant and owns of four corners units  and and of units and aps has a total entitlement from four corners of mw 
the four corners plant site is leased from the navajo nation and is also subject to an easement from the federal government 
aps purchases all of four corners coal requirements from a supplier with a long term lease of coal reserves with the navajo nation 
the four corners coal contract runs through on november   aps and southern california edison sce entered into an asset purchase agreement providing for the purchase by aps of sce s interest in each of units and of four corners 
if consummated  aps would acquire mw from sce unless any of the other owners of interests in units and exercise their rights of first refusal prior to march   in which case aps would not be able to purchase sce s entire share of the units 
completion of the purchase by aps  which is expected to occur in the second half of  is conditioned upon the receipt of regulatory approvals from the acc  the california public utilities commission and the ferc  the execution of a new coal supply contract for a lease renewal period described below  expiration of the waiting period under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act and other typical closing conditions 

table of contents aps  on behalf of the four corners participants  has negotiated amendments to an existing facility lease with the navajo nation which would extend the four corners leasehold interest to execution by the navajo nation of the lease amendments is a condition to closing of the purchase by aps of sce s interests in four corners 
the execution of these amendments by the navajo nation requires the approval of the navajo nation council  which occurred on february  and is awaiting final signature by the nation s president 
the effectiveness of the amendments also requires the approval of the us department of the interior doi  as does a related federal rights of way grant which the four corners participants will pursue 
a federal environmental review will be conducted as part of the doi review process 
aps has announced that  if aps s purchase of sce s interests in units and at four corners is consummated  it will close units  and at the plant 
these events will change the plant s overall generating capacity from  mw to  mw and aps s entitlement from the plant from mw to mw

aps operates the plant and owns of palo verde units and and about of unit in addition  aps leases about of unit  resulting in a combined interest in that unit 
aps has a total entitlement from palo verde of  mw 

table of contents palo verde leases in  aps entered into agreements with three separate lessor trust entities in order to sell and lease back about of its share of palo verde unit and certain common facilities 
prior to  aps accounted for these arrangements as operating leases 
due to amended vie accounting guidance  in aps began consolidating the lessor trust entities  and eliminated lease accounting for these transactions 
the agreements have terms of years and contain options to renew the leases or to purchase the property for fair market value at the end of the lease terms 
aps must give notice to the respective lessor trusts between december  and december  if it wishes to exercise  or not exercise  either of these options 
we are analyzing these options 
see note for additional information regarding the palo verde unit sale leaseback transactions 
palo verde operating licenses operation of each of the three palo verde units requires an operating license from the nrc 
the nrc issued full power operating licenses for unit in june  unit in april and unit in november the full power operating licenses  each valid for a period of years  authorize aps  as operating agent for palo verde  to operate the three palo verde units 
on december   aps applied for renewed operating licenses for the palo verde units for a period of years beyond the expirations of the current licenses 
the current nrc schedule for the applications estimates that a final nrc decision will be issued in april aps is making preparations to secure resources necessary to operate the plant for the period of extended operation  including the execution in april of a municipal effluent purchase and sale agreement that provides effluent water rights necessary for cooling purposes at palo verde through palo verde fuel cycle the fuel cycle for palo verde is comprised of the following stages mining and milling of uranium ore to produce uranium concentrates  conversion of uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride  enrichment of uranium hexafluoride  fabrication of fuel assemblies  utilization of fuel assemblies in reactors  and storage and disposal of spent nuclear fuel 
the palo verde participants are continually identifying their future nuclear fuel resource needs and negotiating arrangements to fill those needs 
the palo verde participants have contracted for all of palo verde s requirements for uranium concentrates through and of its requirements through a new contract is currently being negotiated that will cover palo verde s remaining requirements for uranium concentrates through the participants have also contracted for all of palo verde s conversion services through  all of palo verde s enrichment services through and all of palo verde s fuel assembly fabrication services through spent nuclear fuel and waste disposal the nuclear waste policy act of nwpa required the doe to accept  transport  and dispose of spent nuclear fuel and high level waste generated by the nation s nuclear power plants by the doe s obligations are reflected in a contract for disposal of spent nuclear fuel and or high level radioactive waste standard contract with each nuclear power plant 
the doe failed to begin accepting palo verde s spent nuclear fuel by  and aps on behalf of itself and the other palo verde participants filed a lawsuit for doe s breach of the palo verde standard contract in the us court of federal claims 
the court of federal claims ruled in favor of aps and in october awarded million in damages to the palo verde participants for costs incurred through december 
table of contents the doe had planned to meet its nwpa and standard contract disposal obligations by designing  licensing  constructing  and operating a permanent geologic repository at yucca mountain  nevada 
in june  doe submitted its application to the nrc to authorize construction of the yucca mountain repository 
in march  the doe filed a motion to dismiss with prejudice its yucca mountain construction authorization application that was pending before the nrc 
several interested parties have intervened in the nrc proceeding  and the proceeding has not been conclusively decided by the nrc or the courts 
additionally  a number of interested parties have filed a variety of lawsuits in different jurisdictions around the country challenging the doe s authority to withdraw the yucca mountain construction authorization application 
none of these lawsuits have been conclusively decided by the courts 
palo verde has sufficient capacity at its on site independent spent fuel storage installation isfsi to store all of the nuclear fuel that will be irradiated during the initial operating license period  which ends in december additionally  palo verde has sufficient capacity at its on site isfsi to store a portion of the fuel that will be irradiated during the period of extended operation  which ends in december assuming the nrc approves aps s request for renewed operating licenses  as discussed above 
if uncertainties regarding the united states government s obligation to accept and store spent fuel are not favorably resolved  aps will evaluate alternative storage solutions that may obviate the need to expand the isfsi to accommodate all of the fuel that will be irradiated during the period of extended operation 
in addition to the spent fuel stored at palo verde s on site isfsi  palo verde also generates certain types of low level radioactive waste that are stored on site 
currently  the class b and class c waste the higher radioactivity of the low level wastes is stored on site since industry access to a disposal site was eliminated several years ago 
the nrc is considering regulations that would allow the industry to eliminate much of this waste by blending it with lower level class a waste so that it can be disposed of at a facility such as the one palo verde utilizes in utah 
nuclear decommissioning costs aps currently relies on an external sinking fund mechanism to meet the nrc financial assurance requirements for decommissioning its interests in palo verde units  and the decommissioning costs of palo verde units  and are currently included in aps s acc jurisdictional rates 
decommissioning costs are recoverable through a non bypassable system benefits charge one paid by all retail customers taking service from the aps system  which allows aps to maintain its external sinking fund mechanism 
see note for additional information about aps s nuclear decommissioning costs 
palo verde liability and insurance matters see palo verde nuclear generating station nuclear insurance in note for a discussion of the insurance maintained by the palo verde participants  including aps  for palo verde 
natural gas and oil fueled generating facilities aps has six natural gas power plants located throughout arizona  consisting of redhawk  located near the palo verde nuclear generating station  ocotillo  located in tempe  sundance  located in coolidge  west phoenix  located in southwest phoenix  saguaro  located north of tucson  and yucca  located near yuma 
several of the units at saguaro and yucca run on either gas or oil 
aps has one oil only power plant  douglas  located in the town of douglas  arizona 
aps owns and operates each of these plants with the exception of one combustion turbine unit and one steam unit at yucca that are operated by aps and owned by the imperial irrigation district 
aps has a total entitlement from these plants of  mw 
gas for these plants is acquired through aps s hedging program 
aps has long term gas transportation agreements with three different companies  some of which are effective through fuel oil is acquired under short term purchases delivered primarily to west phoenix  where it is distributed to aps s other oil power plants by truck 

table of contents solar facilities aps owns and operates more than sixty small solar systems around the state 
together they have the capacity to produce about mw of renewable energy 
this fleet of solar systems includes a mw facility located at the prescott airport  a mw facility located at aps s saguaro power plant and less than mw of solar photovoltaic distributed energy systems installed as part of the community power project in flagstaff  arizona 
the community power project  approved by the acc on april   is a pilot program through which  upon completion  aps will own  operate and receive energy from approximately mw of solar photovoltaic distributed energy systems located within a certain test area in flagstaff  arizona 
purchased power contracts in addition to its own available generating capacity  aps purchases electricity under various arrangements  including long term contracts and purchases through short term markets to supplement its owned or leased generation and hedge its energy requirements 
a substantial portion of aps s purchased power expense is netted against wholesale sales on the consolidated statements of income 
see note aps continually assesses its need for additional capacity resources to assure system reliability 
aps does not expect to require new conventional generation sources sooner than  due primarily to planned additions of renewable resources and energy efficiency initiatives 
purchased power capacity aps s purchased power capacity under long term contracts  including its renewable energy portfolio  is summarized in the tables below 
all capacity values are based on net capacity unless otherwise noted

b up to mw of capacity is available  however  the amount of electricity available to aps under this agreement is based in large part on customer demand and is adjusted annually 

table of contents c this is a seasonal capacity exchange agreement under which aps receives electricity during the summer peak season from may to september and aps returns a like amount of electricity during the winter season from october to february 
d the capacity under this agreement increases in phases over the first three years to reach the mw level by the summer of e renewable energy purchased power agreements are described in detail below under current and future resources renewable energy standard renewable energy portfolio 
current and future resources current demand and reserve margin electric power demand is generally seasonal 
in arizona  demand for power peaks during the hot summer months 
aps s peak one hour demand on its electric system was recorded on july  at  mw  compared to the peak of  mw recorded on july  aps s operable generating capacity  together with firm purchases totaling  mw  including short term seasonal purchases and unit contingent purchases  resulted in an actual reserve margin  at the time of the peak demand  of 
the power actually available to aps from its resources fluctuates from time to time due in part to planned and unplanned plant and transmission outages 
future resources and resource plan under the acc s modified resource planning rule  aps will file by april st of each even year its resource plans for the next fifteen year period 
the acc s modified rule also requires aps to file its first resource plan within days after the rule becomes effective 
the modified rule became effective in january and aps will likely file a resource plan in the first quarter of the modified rule also requires the acc to issue an order with its acknowledgment of aps s resource plan within approximately ten months following its submittal 
the acc s acknowledgment of aps s resource plan will consider factors such as the total cost of electric energy services  demand management  analysis of supply side options  system reliability and risk management 

table of contents renewable energy standard in  the acc adopted the res 
under the res  electric utilities that are regulated by the acc must supply an increasing percentage of their retail electric energy sales from eligible renewable resources  including solar  wind  biomass  biogas and geothermal technologies 
the renewable energy requirement is of retail electric sales in and increases annually until it reaches in in aps s retail rate case settlement agreement  aps committed to have  gwh of new renewable resources in service by year end in addition to its renewable resource commitments 
taken together  aps s commitment is estimated to be  gwh  or approximately of retail sales  by year end  which is double the existing res target of for that year 
see note a component of the res is focused on stimulating development of distributed energy systems generally speaking  small scale renewable technologies that are located on customers properties 
accordingly  under the res  an increasing percentage of that requirement must be supplied from distributed energy resources 
this distributed energy requirement is of the overall res requirement of in and increases to of the applicable res requirement in and subsequent years 
the following table summarizes these requirement standards and their timing res as a of retail electric sales percent of res to be supplied from distributed energy resources renewable energy portfolio 
aps has a diverse portfolio of existing and planned renewable resources totaling mw  including wind  geothermal  solar  biomass and biogas 
of this portfolio  mw are currently in operation and mw are under contract for development or are under construction 
renewable resources in operation include mw of facilities owned by aps  mw of long term purchased power agreements  and an estimated mw of customer sited  third party owned distributed energy resources 
aps continues to actively consider opportunities to enhance its renewable energy portfolio  both to ensure its compliance with the res and to meet the needs of its customer base 
aps s strategy to achieve its res requirements includes executing purchased power contracts for new facilities  ongoing development of distributed energy resources and procurement of new facilities to be owned by aps 
one of the key programs under which aps will own solar resources is the az sun program 
as approved by the acc  the az sun program will allow aps to own mw of solar photovoltaic power plants across arizona by investing up to million through under this program to date  aps has executed contracts for the development of mw of new solar generation  representing an investment commitment of approximately million 
see note for additional details about the az sun program  including the related cost recovery

table of contents demand side management arizona regulators are placing an increased focus on energy efficiency and other demand side management programs to encourage customers to conserve energy  while incentivizing utilities to aid in these efforts that ultimately reduce the demand for energy 
in december  the acc initiated energy efficiency rulemaking  with a proposed energy efficiency standard of cumulative annual energy savings by this standard was adopted and became effective on january  this ambitious standard will likely impact arizona s future energy resource needs 
see note for energy efficiency and other demand side management obligations resulting from aps s retail rate case settlement 
economic stimulus projects through the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra  the federal government made a number of programs available for utilities to develop renewable resources  improve reliability and create jobs by using economic stimulus funding 
certain programs are also available through the state of arizona 
in  the doe announced an arra commitment to fund the majority of a carbon dioxide emission reduction research and development project in the amount of million  which was to be located at our cholla power plant 
due to the increased resource and funding requirements for a project of that size  aps elected not to move forward with that award and is now in the process of closing out the project 
however  aps is moving forward with work under the million award from doe for a high penetration photovoltaic generation study related to the community power project in flagstaff  arizona 
the funding under this doe award will continue to be contingent upon meeting certain project milestones  including doe established budget parameters  over the next four years 
aps is also continuing its work as a sub recipient under an arra award received through the state of arizona s department of commerce 
this approximately million award is for the implementation of various distributed energy and energy efficiency programs in arizona 
aps will be implementing certain solar water heater and photovoltaic related community projects under this award 
competitive environment and regulatory oversight retail the acc regulates aps s retail electric rates and its issuance of securities 
the acc must also approve any transfer or encumbrance of aps s property used to provide retail electric service and approve or receive prior notification of certain transactions between pinnacle west  aps and their respective affiliates 

table of contents aps is subject to varying degrees of competition from other investor owned electric and gas utilities in arizona such as southwest gas corporation  as well as cooperatives  municipalities  electrical districts and similar types of governmental or non profit organizations 
in addition  some customers  particularly industrial and large commercial customers  may own and operate generation facilities to meet some or all of their own energy requirements 
this practice is becoming more popular with customers installing or having installed products such as roof top solar panels to meet or supplement their energy needs 
in  the acc approved rules for the introduction of retail electric competition in arizona 
as a result  as of january   all of aps s retail customers were eligible to choose alternate energy suppliers 
however  there are currently no active retail competitors offering unbundled energy or other utility services to aps s customers 
in  the arizona superior court found that the rules were in part unconstitutional and in other respects unlawful  the latter finding being primarily on procedural grounds  and invalidated all acc orders authorizing competitive electric services providers to operate in arizona 
in  the arizona court of appeals invalidated some  but not all of the rules and upheld the invalidation of the orders authorizing competitive electric service providers 
in  the arizona supreme court declined to review the court of appeals decision 
to date  the acc has taken no further or substantive action on either the rules or the prior orders authorizing competitive electric service providers in response to the final court of appeals decision 
in  the acc directed the acc staff to investigate whether such retail competition was in the public interest and what legal impediments remain to competition in light of the court of appeals decision referenced above 
the acc staff s report on the results of its investigation was issued on august  the report stated that additional analysis  discussion and study of all aspects of the issue are required in order to perform a proper evaluation 
while the report did not make any specific recommendations other than to conduct more workshops  the report did state that the current retail electric competition rules are incomplete and in need of modification 
on april   the acc issued a decision holding that solar vendors that install and operate solar facilities for non profit schools and governments pursuant to a specific type of contract that calculates payments based on the energy produced are not public service corporations under the arizona constitution  and are therefore not regulated by the acc 
a second matter is pending with the acc to determine whether that ruling should extend to solar providers who serve a broader customer base under the same business model 
use of such products by customers within our territory would result in some level of competition 
aps cannot predict when  and the extent to which  additional electric service providers will enter or re enter aps s service territory 

table of contents wholesale the ferc regulates rates for wholesale power sales and transmission services 
see note for information regarding aps s transmission rates 
during  approximately of aps s electric operating revenues resulted from such sales and services 
aps s wholesale activity primarily consists of managing fuel and purchased power supplies to serve retail customer energy requirements 
aps also sells  in the wholesale market  its generation output that is not needed for aps s native load and  in doing so  competes with other utilities  power marketers and independent power producers 
additionally  subject to specified parameters  aps markets  hedges and trades in electricity and fuels 
environmental matters climate change legislative initiatives 
in the past several years  the united states congress has considered bills that would regulate domestic greenhouse gas emissions 
in  the house of representatives passed a comprehensive energy and climate change bill  but the senate did not consider it or a similar bill in the th congress 
with much focus on the economy  it is unclear when congress will consider another global warming bill 
the actual economic and operational impact of any legislation on aps depends on a variety of factors  none of which can be fully known until such legislation passes and the specifics of the resulting program are established 
these factors include the terms of the legislation with regard to allowed emissions  whether any permitted emissions allowances will be allocated to source operators free of cost or auctioned  the cost to reduce emissions or buy allowances in the marketplace  and the availability of offsets and mitigating factors to moderate the costs of compliance 
at the present time  we cannot predict what form of legislation  if any  will ultimately pass 
in addition to federal legislative initiatives  state specific initiatives may also impact our business 
while arizona has not yet enacted any state specific legislation regarding greenhouse gas emissions  the california legislature enacted ab and sb in to address greenhouse gas emissions 
in december  the california air resources board approved regulations that will establish a cap and trade program for greenhouse gas emissions which is scheduled to be launched in as part of the state s program implementing ab in addition  the new mexico environmental improvement board recently enacted a greenhouse gas cap and trade program and emissions cap  to become effective in and  respectively 
we are monitoring these and other state legislative developments to understand the extent to which they may affect our business  including our sales into the impacted states or the ability of our out of state power plant participants to continue their participation in certain coal fired power plants 
in particular  sce  a participant in four corners  has indicated that sb may prohibit it from making emission control expenditures at the plant 
see energy sources and resource planning generation facilities coal fueled generating facilities four corners above for details of the pending sale of sce s interest in four corners to aps 

table of contents regulatory initiatives 
in december  the epa determined that greenhouse gas emissions endanger public health and welfare 
this determination was made in response to a united states supreme court ruling that greenhouse gases fit within the clean air act s broad definition of air pollutant and  as a result  the epa has the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions of new motor vehicles under the clean air act 
as a result of the endangerment finding  the epa determined that the clean air act required new regulatory requirements for new and modified major greenhouse gas emitting sources  including power plants 
on june   the epa issued a rule under the clean air act  known as the tailoring rule  establishing new greenhouse gas emissions thresholds that determine when sources  including power plants  must obtain air operating permits or new source review permits 
new source review is a pre construction permitting program under the clean air act that requires analysis of pollution controls prior to building a new stationary source or making major modifications to an existing stationary source 
the tailoring rule became effective on august  and it became applicable to power plants on january  several groups have filed lawsuits challenging the epa s endangerment finding and the tailoring rule 
aps does not expect the tailoring rule to have a significant impact on its current operations 
the rule will require aps to consider the impact of greenhouse gas emissions as part of its traditional new source review analysis for new sources and major modifications to existing plants 
at the present time  we cannot predict what other rules or regulations may ultimately result from the epa s endangerment finding  whether the parties challenging the endangerment finding or the tailoring rule will be successful  and what impact other potential rules or regulations will have on aps s operations 
on december   pursuant to its authority under the clean air act  the epa finalized a greenhouse gas federal implementation plan fip for arizona relating to pre construction permits for construction of new sources or major modifications of existing sources 
as a result of this action  effective january   the epa assumed responsibility for acting on permit applications for only the greenhouse gas portion of such pre construction permits 
state permitting authorities will continue to retain responsibility for the remaining parts of pre construction permits that are unrelated to emissions of greenhouse gasses 
to the extent arizona seeks and receives from the epa a delegation of permitting authority for greenhouse gas emissions  the state will assume responsibility for issuing both the greenhouse gas and non greenhouse gas portions of pre construction permits 
the greenhouse gas fip will remain in place until such time as the epa approves a state implementation plan that applies pre construction permit requirements to greenhouse gas emitting stationary sources in arizona 
aps does not expect the greenhouse gas fip to have a significant impact on its current operations 
the epa also recently announced its intent to promulgate new source performance standards nsps for greenhouse gas emissions from certain industrial facilities  under the clean air act 
the epa intends to propose the new standards by july and to finalize them by may the epa has indicated that the rules will apply to coal fired electric generating units egus and will establish nsps for new and modified egus and emission guidelines for existing egus 
the rules are expected to apply to the four corners  cholla and the navajo plant 
we cannot currently predict the impact of these rules on aps s operations 
if any emission reduction legislation or additional regulations are enacted  we will assess our compliance alternatives  which may include replacement of existing equipment  installation of additional pollution control equipment  purchase of allowances  retirement or suspension of operations at certain coal fired facilities  or other actions 
although associated capital expenditures or operating costs resulting from greenhouse gas emission regulations or legislation could be material  we believe that we would be able to recover the costs of these environmental compliance initiatives through our rates 

table of contents regional initiative 
in  six western states arizona  california  new mexico  oregon  utah and washington and two canadian provinces british columbia and manitoba entered into an accord  the western climate initiative wci  to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from automobiles and certain industries  including utilities 
montana  quebec and ontario have also joined wci 
wci participants set a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions below levels by after soliciting public comment  in september wci issued the design of a cap and trade program for greenhouse gas emissions 
due in part to the recent activity at the federal level discussed above  the initiative s momentum and the movement toward detailed proposed rules has slowed 
on february   arizona s governor issued an executive order stating that arizona will continue to be a member of wci to monitor its advancements in this area  but it will not implement the wci regional cap and trade program 
as a result  while we continue to monitor the progress of wci  at the present time we do not believe it will have a material impact on our operations 
company response to climate change initiatives 
we have undertaken a number of initiatives to address emission concerns  including renewable energy procurement and development  promotion of programs and rates that promote energy conservation  renewable energy use and energy efficiency 
see energy sources and resource planning current and future resources above for details of these plans and initiatives 
aps currently has a diverse portfolio of renewable resources  including wind  geothermal  solar and biomass and we are focused on increasing the percentage of our energy that is produced by renewable resources 
in january  aps joined the climate registry as a founding reporter 
founding reporters are companies that voluntarily joined the non profit organization before may to measure and report greenhouse gas emissions in a common  accurate and transparent manner consistent across industry sectors and borders 
beginning in  aps stopped participating in the climate registry because aps began reporting substantially the same information under the mandatory greenhouse gas reporting rule issued by the epa on september  pinnacle west prepares an annual corporate responsibility report  which is available on our website www 
pinnaclewest 
com 
the report provides information related to the company and its approach to sustainability and its workplace and environmental performance 
the information on pinnacle west s website  including the corporate responsibility report  is not incorporated by reference into this report 
climate change lawsuits 
in february  the native village of kivalina and the city of kivalina  alaska filed a lawsuit in federal court in the northern district of california against nine oil companies  fourteen power companies including pinnacle west  and a coal company  alleging that the defendants emissions of carbon dioxide contribute to global warming and constitute a public and private nuisance 
the plaintiffs also allege that the effects of global warming will require the relocation of the village and they are seeking an unspecified amount of monetary damages 
in june  the defendants filed motions to dismiss the action  which were granted 
the plaintiffs filed an appeal with the ninth circuit court of appeals in november  and pinnacle west filed its reply on june  the court has not yet scheduled oral arguments on the plaintiffs appeal 
we believe the action is without merit and intend to continue to defend against the claims 
a similar nuisance lawsuit  american electric power co  inc v 
connecticut  is currently pending in the united states supreme court 
another such lawsuit was dismissed by the fifth circuit on procedural grounds 
both cases  as well as the kivalina case  raise political and legal considerations  including whether the courts can or should be making climate change policy decisions 
the outcome of the american electric power case is particularly significant because the issues being considered by the supreme court closely overlap with the main issues presented in the kivalina appeal 
we are not a party to either of these two lawsuits  but are monitoring these developments and their potential industry impacts 

table of contents epa environmental regulation regional haze rules 
over a decade ago  the epa announced regional haze rules to reduce visibility impairment in national parks and wilderness areas 
the rules require states or  for sources located on tribal land  the epa to determine what pollution control technologies constitute the best available retrofit technology bart for certain older major stationary sources 
the epa subsequently issued the clean air visibility rule  which provides guidelines on how to perform a bart analysis 
cholla 
in  adeq required aps to perform a bart analysis for cholla pursuant to the clean air visibility rule 
aps completed the bart analysis for cholla and submitted its bart recommendations to adeq on february  the recommendations include the installation of certain pollution control equipment that aps believes constitutes bart 
adeq has reviewed aps s recommendations and is expected to submit to epa region its proposed bart state implementation plan sip for cholla and other sources within the state in the near future 
on january   a group of environmental organizations notified epa of its intent to sue the agency as a result of epa s alleged failure to promulgate a federal implementation plan for states that have not yet submitted all or part of the required bart sips  including arizona 
once aps receives a final determination as to what constitutes bart for cholla  we will have five years to complete the installation of the equipment and to achieve the emission limits established by adeq 
however  in order to coordinate with the plant s other scheduled activities  aps is currently implementing portions of its recommended plan for cholla on a voluntary basis 
costs related to the implementation of these portions of our recommended plan are included in our environmental expenditure estimates see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capital expenditures in item 
four corners and the navajo plant 
epa region previously requested that aps  as the operating agent for four corners  and srp  as the operating agent for the navajo plant  perform a bart analysis for four corners and the navajo plant  respectively 
aps and srp each submitted an analysis to the epa concluding that certain combustion control equipment constitutes bart for these plants 
based on the analyses and comments received through epa s rulemaking process  the epa will determine what it believes constitutes bart for each plant 
on october   the epa issued its proposed bart determination for four corners 
the proposed rule would require the installation of post combustion controls on each of units at four corners to reduce nitrogen oxides nox emissions 
current estimates indicate that aps s total costs for these controls could be up to approximately million for four corners 
if aps s purchase of sce s interest in units and is consummated and units are closed  aps s total costs for these controls would be approximately million 
see energy sources and resource planning generation facilities coal fueled generating facilities four corners for details of this proposed transaction 
the epa also indicated in the proposal that it may require the installation of electrostatic precipitators or baghouses on units  and to reduce particulate matter emissions 
aps estimates that its total costs for such particulate removal equipment is approximately million  which may also be required under the anticipated mercury rules 
see environmental matters mercury and other hazardous air pollutants below for additional information on these anticipated rules 
the epa proposed a stack opacity limitation for all five units and a opacity limitation on certain fugitive dust emissions  although the proposed fugitive dust provision is unrelated to bart 

table of contents on november   aps submitted a letter to the epa proposing an alternative to the epa s october bart proposal 
specifically  aps proposed to close four corners units  and by and to install post combustion pollution controls for nox on units and by the end of  provided that the epa agrees to a contemporaneous resolution of four corners obligations or liability  if any  under the regional haze and reasonably attributable visibility impairment programs  the new source review program  and nsps programs of the clean air act 
on february   the epa signed a supplemental notice requesting comment  related to the bart rulemaking for four corners 
in the supplemental notice  the epa proposed to find that a different alternative emission control strategy  based upon aps s november proposal  would achieve more progress than the epa s october bart proposal 
the supplemental notice proposes that units  and would close by  post combustion pollution controls for nox would be installed on units and by july   and the nox emission limitation for units and would be lbs mmbtu  rather than the lbs mmbtu proposed by the epa in october the epa extended the comment deadline for both the october proposal and the supplemental notice to may  we are currently evaluating both proposals and will be providing comments to the epa on both 
the epa has not yet issued a proposed rule for the navajo plant 
srp s recommended plan for the navajo plant includes the installation of combustion control equipment  with an estimated cost to aps of approximately million based on aps s navajo plant ownership interest 
if the epa determines that post combustion controls are required  aps s total costs could be up to approximately million for the navajo plant 
the four corners and the navajo plant participants will have five years after the epa issues its final determinations to achieve compliance with their respective bart requirements 
in addition  on february   a group of environmental organizations filed a petition with the departments of interior and agriculture requesting those agencies to certify to the epa that visibility impairment in sixteen national park and wilderness areas is reasonably attributable to emissions from four corners  the navajo plant and other non aps plants 
if the agencies certify impairment  the epa is required to evaluate and  if necessary  determine bart for four corners and the navajo plant under a different haze program known as reasonably attributable visibility impairment 
on january   a similar group of environmental organizations filed a lawsuit against the departments of interior and agriculture  alleging among other things that the agencies failed to act on the february petition without unreasonable delay and requesting the court to order the agencies to act on the petition within days 
we are currently evaluating the potential impact of this lawsuit on aps 
the four corners and navajo plant participants obligations to comply with the epa s final bart determinations  coupled with the financial impact of future climate change legislation  other environmental regulations  the result of the lawsuit mentioned above and other business considerations  could jeopardize the economic viability of these plants or the ability of individual participants to continue their participation in these plants 
in order to coordinate with each plant s other scheduled activities  the plants are currently implementing portions of their recommended plans described above on a voluntary basis 
aps s share of the costs related to the implementation of these portions of the recommended plans are included in our environmental expenditure estimates see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capital expenditures in item 

table of contents mercury and other hazardous air pollutants 
in early  the us court of appeals for the dc circuit vacated the clean air mercury rule camr  which was adopted by the epa to regulate mercury emissions from coal fired power plants 
as a result  the law in effect prior to the adoption of the camr became the applicable law  and the epa is now required to adopt final maximum achievable control technology emissions mact standards 
under a consent decree that was finalized on april   the epa has agreed to issue final mact standards for mercury and other hazardous air pollutants by november under the terms of the consent decree  aps will have three years after the epa issues its final rule to achieve compliance  which would likely require aps to install additional pollution control equipment 
aps has installed  and continues to install  certain of the equipment necessary to meet the anticipated standards 
aps estimates that the cost for equipment necessary to meet these anticipated standards is approximately million for four corners units and million for cholla units the estimated costs for four corners units are not included in our current environmental expenditure estimates since our estimates assume the consummation of aps s purchase of sce s interest in four corners units and and the subsequent shut down of units cholla s estimated costs for the next three years are included in our environmental expenditure estimates 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capital expenditures in item for details of our capital expenditure estimates 
coal combustion waste 
on june   the epa released its proposed regulations governing the handling and disposal of coal combustion residuals ccrs  such as fly ash and bottom ash 
aps currently disposes of ccrs in ash ponds and dry storage areas at cholla and four corners  and also sells a portion of its fly ash for beneficial reuse as a constituent in concrete production 
the epa proposes regulating ccrs as either non hazardous waste or hazardous waste and requested comments on three different alternatives 
the hazardous waste proposal would phase out the use of ash ponds for disposal of ccrs 
the other two proposals regulate ccrs as non hazardous waste and impose performance standards for ash disposal 
one of these proposals would require retrofitting or closure of currently unlined ash ponds  while the other proposal would not require the installation of liners or pond closures 
the epa has not yet indicated a preference for any of the alternatives 
aps filed comments on the proposed rule during the public comment period  which ended on november  we do not know when the epa will issue a final rule  including required compliance dates 
we cannot currently predict the outcome of the epa s actions or whether such actions will have a material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
ozone national ambient air quality standards 
in march  the epa adopted new  more stringent eight hour ozone standards  known as national ambient air quality standards or naaqs 
in january  the epa proposed to adopt even more stringent eight hour ozone naaqs 
as ozone standards become more stringent  our fossil generation units may come under increasing pressure to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds and or to generate emission offsets for new projects or facility expansions 
at this time  aps is unable to predict what impact the adoption of these standards may have on its operations 

table of contents new source review 
on april   aps received a request from the epa under section of the clean air act seeking detailed information regarding projects at and operations of four corners 
this request is part of an enforcement initiative that the epa has undertaken under the clean air act 
the epa has taken the position that many utilities have made certain physical or operational changes at their plants that should have triggered additional regulatory requirements under the new source review provisions of the clean air act 
other electric utilities have received and responded to similar section requests  and several of them have been the subject of notices of violation and lawsuits by the epa 
aps responded to the epa s request in august and is currently unable to predict the timing or content of the epa s response  if any  or any resulting actions 
on may   aps received a notice of intent to sue from earthjustice  on behalf of several environmental organizations  related to alleged violations of the clean air act at four corners the notice 
the notice alleges new source review related violations and nsps violations 
under the clean air act  a citizens group is required to provide days advance notice of its intent to file a lawsuit 
within that day time period  the epa may step in and file a lawsuit regarding the allegations 
if the epa does so  the citizens group is precluded from filing its own lawsuit  but it may still intervene in the epa s lawsuit  if it so desires 
the day period lapsed in early july  and the epa did not take any action 
at this time  we cannot predict whether or when earthjustice might file a lawsuit 
endangered species act 
on january   the center for biological diversity  dine citizens against running our environment  and san juan citizens alliance field a lawsuit against the office of surface mining reclamation and enforcement osm and the department of the interior  alleging that osm failed to engage in mandatory endangered species act esa consultation with the fish and wildlife service prior to authorizing the renewal of an operating permit for the mine that serves four corners 
the lawsuit alleges that activities at the mine  including mining and the disposal of coal combustion residue  will adversely affect several endangered species and their critical habitats 
the lawsuit requests the court to vacate and remand the mining permit and enjoin all activities carried out under the permit until osm has complied with the esa 
although we are not a party to the lawsuit  we are evaluating the lawsuit to determine its potential impact on plant operations 
superfund 
the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act superfund establishes liability for the cleanup of hazardous substances found contaminating the soil  water or air 
those who generated  transported or disposed of hazardous substances at a contaminated site are among those who are prps 
prps may be strictly  and often are jointly and severally  liable for clean up 
on september   the epa advised aps that the epa considers aps to be a prp in the motorola nd street superfund site  operable unit ou in phoenix  arizona 
aps has facilities that are within this superfund site 
aps and pinnacle west have agreed with the epa to perform certain investigative activities of the aps facilities within ou in addition  on september   aps agreed with the epa and one other prp to voluntarily assist with the funding and management of the site wide groundwater remedial investigation and feasibility study work plan 
aps estimates that its costs related to this investigation and study will be approximately million  which is reserved as a liability on its financial statements 
we anticipate incurring additional expenditures in the future  but because the overall investigation is not complete and ultimate remediation requirements are not yet finalized  at the present time we cannot accurately estimate our total expenditures 
by letter dated april   the epa informed aps that it may be a prp in the gila river indian reservation superfund site in maricopa county  arizona 
aps  along with three other electric utility companies  owns a parcel of property on which a transmission pole and a portion of a transmission line are located 
the property abuts the gila river indian community boundary and  at one time  may have been part of an airfield where crop dusting took place 
currently  the epa is only seeking payment from aps and four other prps for past cleanup related costs involving contamination from the crop dusting 
based upon the total amount of cleanup costs reported by the epa in its letter to aps  we do not expect that the resolution of this matter will have a material adverse impact on aps s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
manufactured gas plant sites 
certain properties which aps now owns or which were previously owned by it or its corporate predecessors were at one time sites of  or sites associated with  manufactured gas plants 
aps is taking action to voluntarily remediate these sites 
aps does not expect these matters to have a material adverse effect on its financial position  results of operations  cash flows or liquidity 

table of contents navajo nation environmental issues four corners and the navajo plant are located on the navajo reservation and are held under easements granted by the federal government as well as leases from the navajo nation 
see energy sources and resource planning generation facilities coal fueled generating facilities above for additional information regarding these plants 
in july  the navajo nation enacted the navajo nation air pollution prevention and control act  the navajo nation safe drinking water act and the navajo nation pesticide act collectively  the navajo acts 
the navajo acts purport to give the navajo nation environmental protection agency authority to promulgate regulations covering air quality  drinking water and pesticide activities  including those activities that occur at four corners and the navajo plant 
on october   the four corners participants and the navajo plant participants each filed a lawsuit in the district court of the navajo nation  window rock district  challenging the applicability of the navajo acts as to four corners and the navajo plant 
the court has stayed these proceedings pursuant to a request by the parties  and the parties are seeking to negotiate a settlement 
in april  the navajo nation council approved operating permit regulations under the navajo nation air pollution prevention and control act 
aps believes the navajo nation exceeded its authority when it adopted the operating permit regulations 
on july   the four corners participants and the navajo plant participants each filed a petition with the navajo supreme court for review of these regulations 
those proceedings have been stayed  pending the settlement negotiations mentioned above 
aps cannot currently predict the outcome of this matter 
on may   aps  salt river project  as the operating agent for the navajo plant  and the navajo nation executed a voluntary compliance agreement to resolve their disputes regarding the navajo nation air pollution prevention and control act 
as a result of this agreement  aps sought  and the courts granted  dismissal of the pending litigation in the navajo nation supreme court and the navajo nation district court  to the extent the claims relate to the clean air act 
the agreement does not address or resolve any dispute relating to other navajo acts 
aps cannot currently predict the outcome of this matter 
water supply assured supplies of water are important for aps s generating plants 
at the present time  aps has adequate water to meet its needs 
however  the four corners region  in which four corners is located  has been experiencing drought conditions that may affect the water supply for the plants if adequate moisture is not received in the watershed that supplies the area 
aps is continuing to work with area stakeholders to implement agreements to minimize the effect  if any  on future operations of the plant 
the effect of the drought cannot be fully assessed at this time  and aps cannot predict the ultimate outcome  if any  of the drought or whether the drought will adversely affect the amount of power available  or the price thereof  from four corners 
conflicting claims to limited amounts of water in the southwestern united states have resulted in numerous court actions  which  in addition to future supply conditions  have the potential to impact aps operations 

table of contents san juan river adjudication 
both groundwater and surface water in areas important to aps s operations have been the subject of inquiries  claims and legal proceedings  which will require a number of years to resolve 
aps is one of a number of parties in a proceeding  filed march   before the eleventh judicial district court in new mexico to adjudicate rights to a stream system from which water for four corners is derived 
an agreement reached with the navajo nation in  however  provides that if four corners loses a portion of its rights in the adjudication  the navajo nation will provide  for an agreed upon cost  sufficient water from its allocation to offset the loss 
gila river adjudication 
a summons served on aps in early required all water claimants in the lower gila river watershed in arizona to assert any claims to water on or before january   in an action pending in maricopa county  arizona  superior court 
palo verde is located within the geographic area subject to the summons 
aps s rights and the rights of the other palo verde participants to the use of groundwater and effluent at palo verde are potentially at issue in this action 
as operating agent of palo verde  aps filed claims that dispute the court s jurisdiction over the palo verde participants groundwater rights and their contractual rights to effluent relating to palo verde 
alternatively  aps seeks confirmation of such rights 
five of aps s other power plants are also located within the geographic area subject to the summons 
aps s claims dispute the court s jurisdiction over its groundwater rights with respect to these plants 
alternatively  aps seeks confirmation of such rights 
in november  the arizona supreme court issued a decision confirming that certain groundwater rights may be available to the federal government and indian tribes 
in addition  in september  the arizona supreme court issued a decision affirming the lower court s criteria for resolving groundwater claims 
litigation on both of these issues has continued in the trial court 
in december  aps and other parties filed a petition with the arizona supreme court requesting interlocutory review of a september trial court order regarding procedures for determining whether groundwater pumping is affecting surface water rights 
the court denied the petition in may  and the trial court is now proceeding with implementation of its order 
no trial date concerning aps s water rights claims has been set in this matter

table of contents item a 
risk factors in addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in the description of these operations contained elsewhere in this report  set forth below are risks and uncertainties that could affect our financial results 
unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires  the following risks and uncertainties apply to pinnacle west and its subsidiaries  including aps 
regulatory risks our financial condition depends upon aps s ability to recover costs in a timely manner from customers through regulated rates and otherwise execute its business strategy 
aps is subject to comprehensive regulation by several federal  state and local regulatory agencies that significantly influence its business  liquidity  results of operations and its ability to fully recover costs from utility customers in a timely manner 
the acc regulates aps s retail electric rates and the ferc regulates rates for wholesale power sales and transmission services 
the profitability of aps is affected by the rates it may charge 
consequently  our financial condition and results of operations are dependent upon the satisfactory resolution of any aps retail rate proceedings and ancillary matters which may come before the acc and the ferc 
arizona  like certain other states  has a statute that allows the acc to reopen prior decisions and modify final orders under certain circumstances 
the acc must also approve aps s issuance of securities and any transfer of aps property used to provide retail electric service  and must approve or receive prior notification of certain transactions between us  aps and our respective affiliates 
decisions made by the acc and the ferc could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
aps s ability to conduct its business operations and avoid fines and penalties depends upon compliance with federal  state or local statutes and regulations  and obtaining and maintaining certain regulatory permits  approvals and certificates 
aps must comply in good faith with all applicable statutes  regulations  rules  tariffs  and orders of agencies that regulate aps s business  including the ferc  the nrc  the epa and state and local governmental agencies 
these agencies regulate many aspects of aps s utility operations  including safety and performance  emissions  siting and construction of facilities  customer service and the rates that aps can charge retail and wholesale customers 
failure to comply can subject aps to  among other things  fines and penalties 
for example  under the energy policy act of  the ferc can impose penalties up to one million dollars per day per violation for failure to comply with mandatory electric reliability standards 
in addition  aps is required to have numerous permits  approvals and certificates from these agencies 
aps believes the necessary permits  approvals and certificates have been obtained for its existing operations and that aps s business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws in all material respects 
however  changes in regulations or the imposition of new or revised laws or regulations could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
we are also unable to predict the impact on our business and operating results from pending or future regulatory activities of any of these agencies 
the operation of aps s nuclear power plant exposes it to substantial regulatory oversight and potentially significant liabilities and capital expenditures 
the nrc has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety related requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities 
in the event of noncompliance  the nrc has the authority to impose monetary civil penalties or a progressively increased inspection regime that could ultimately result in the shut down of a unit  or both  depending upon the nrc s assessment of the severity of the situation  until compliance is achieved 
the increased costs resulting from penalties  a heightened level of scrutiny and implementation of plans to achieve compliance with nrc requirements may adversely affect aps s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
aps is subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations  and changes in  or liabilities under  existing or new laws or regulations may increase aps s cost of operations or impact its business plans 
aps is subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of its present and future operations  including air emissions  water quality  wastewater discharges  solid waste  hazardous waste  and coal combustion products  which consist of bottom ash  fly ash and air pollution control wastes 
these laws and regulations can result in increased capital  operating  and other costs  particularly with regard to enforcement efforts focused on power plant emissions obligations 
these laws and regulations generally require aps to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses  permits  and other approvals 
if there is a delay or failure to obtain any required environmental regulatory approval  or if aps fails to obtain  maintain or comply with any such approval  operations at affected facilities could be suspended or subject to additional expenses 
in addition  failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations could result in civil liability or criminal penalties 
both public officials and private individuals may seek to enforce applicable environmental laws and regulations 
aps cannot predict the outcome financial or operational of any related litigation that may arise 

table of contents environmental clean up 
aps has been named as a prp for a superfund site in phoenix  arizona and it could be named a prp in the future for other environmental clean up at sites identified by a regulatory body 
aps cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of all future expenditures related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating clean up costs 
there is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on all potentially responsible parties 
regional haze 
aps is currently awaiting a final rulemaking from the epa that could impose new requirements on four corners and the navajo plant 
aps is also awaiting a final rulemaking from adeq that could impose new requirements on cholla 
the epa and adeq will require these plants to install pollution control equipment that constitutes the best available retrofit technology to lessen the impacts of emissions on visibility surrounding the plants 
depending upon the agencies final determinations of what constitutes bart for these plants  the financial impact of installing the required pollution control equipment could jeopardize the economic viability of the plants or the ability of individual participants to continue their participation in these plants 
coal ash 
the epa released proposed regulations governing the disposal of ccrs  which are generated as a result of burning coal and consist of  among other things  fly ash and bottom ash 
the epa proposed regulating ccrs as either non hazardous or hazardous waste 
aps currently disposes of ccrs in ash ponds and dry storage areas at four corners and cholla  and also sells a portion of its fly ash for beneficial reuse as a constituent in concrete products 
if the epa regulates ccrs as a hazardous solid waste or phases out aps s ability to dispose of ccrs through the use of ash ponds  aps could incur significant costs for ccr disposal and may be unable to continue its sale of fly ash for beneficial reuse 
new source review 
the epa has taken the position that many projects electric utilities have performed are major modifications that trigger new source review requirements under the clean air act 
the utilities generally have taken the position that these projects are routine maintenance and did not result in emissions increases  and thus are not subject to new source review 
in  aps received and responded to a request from the epa regarding projects and operations of four corners 
a civilian organization notified the four corners participants that it intends to file a citizen suit against the participants for alleged violations of new source review and the nsps program of the clean air act 
if the epa seeks to impose new source review requirements at four corners or any other aps plant  or if the citizen suit is filed and the citizens group prevails  significant capital investments could be required to install new pollution control technologies 
the epa could also seek civil penalties 
mercury and other hazardous air pollutants 
the epa is required to adopt maximum achievable control technology emissions standards for mercury and other hazardous air pollutants by november compliance with the new standards will be required three years after the epa issues its final rule 
depending on the compliance requirements contained in the final rule  aps may need to make significant capital investments to install additional pollution control equipment to meet these new standards 
aps cannot assure that existing environmental regulations will not be revised or that new regulations seeking to protect the environment will not be adopted or become applicable to it 
revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions  particularly if those costs incurred by aps are not fully recoverable from aps s customers  could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents aps faces physical and operational risks related to climate change  and potential financial risks resulting from climate change litigation and legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions 
concern over climate change  deemed by many to be induced by rising levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere  has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit co  which is a major byproduct of the combustion of fossil fuel  and other greenhouse gas emissions 
in addition  lawsuits have been filed against companies that emit greenhouse gases  including a lawsuit filed by the native village of kivalina and the city of kivalina  alaska against us and several other utilities seeking damages related to climate change  which was dismissed but has been appealed 
financial risks potential legislation and regulation 
in the past several years  the united states congress has considered bills that would regulate domestic greenhouse gas emissions 
it is possible that some form of legislation may occur in the future at the federal level with respect to greenhouse gas emissions 
if the united states congress  or individual states or groups of states in which aps operates  ultimately pass legislation regulating the emissions of greenhouse gases  any resulting limitations on co and other greenhouse gas emissions could result in the creation of substantial additional capital expenditures and operating costs in the form of taxes  emissions allowances or required equipment upgrades and could have a material adverse impact on all fossil fuel fired generation facilities particularly coal fired facilities  which constitute approximately of aps s generation capacity 
at the state level  the california legislature enacted legislation to address greenhouse gas emissions and the california air resources board approved regulations that will establish a cap and trade program for greenhouse gas 
this legislation  regulation and other state specific initiatives may affect aps s business  including sales into the impacted states or the ability of its out of state power plant participants to continue their participation in certain coal fired power plants  including four corners following expiration of the current lease term in in addition  the epa has determined that greenhouse gas emissions endanger public health and welfare 
this determination was made in response to a united states supreme court ruling that greenhouse gases fit within the clean air act s broad definition of air pollutant and  as a result  the epa has the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions of new motor vehicles under the clean air act 
as a result of the endangerment finding  the epa determined that the clean air act required new regulatory requirements for new and modified major greenhouse gas emitting sources  including power plants 
several groups have filed lawsuits challenging the epa s endangerment finding 
aps cannot predict what rules or regulations may ultimately result from the epa s endangerment finding  whether the parties challenging the endangerment finding will be successful  or what impact other potential rules or regulations will have on aps s operations 
excessive costs to comply with future legislation or regulations could force aps and other similarly situated electric power generators to retire or suspend operations at certain coal fired facilities 
physical and operational risks 
assuming that the primary physical and operational risks to aps from climate change are increased potential for drought or water shortage  and a mild to moderate increase in ambient temperatures  aps believes it is taking the appropriate steps to respond to these risks 
weather extremes such as drought and high temperature variations are common occurrences in the southwest s desert area  and these are risks that aps considers in the normal course of business in the engineering and construction of its electric system 
large increases in ambient temperatures could require evaluation of certain materials used within its system and represent a greater challenge 

table of contents if aps cannot meet or maintain the level of renewable energy required under arizona s increasing renewable energy standards  aps may be subject to penalties or fines for non compliance 
the res requires aps to supply an increasing percentage of renewable energy each year  so that the amount of retail electricity sales from eligible renewable resources is at least of total retail sales by this amount increases annually to by in its retail rate case settlement agreement  aps agreed to exceed these standards and committed to an interim renewable energy target of  gwh of renewable resources to be in service by year end in addition to its renewable resource commitments 
taken together  aps s commitment is estimated to be  gwh  or approximately of retail sales  by year end a portion of this total renewable energy requirement must be met with an increasing percentage of distributed energy resources generally  small scale renewable technologies located on customers properties 
the distributed energy requirement is of the overall res requirement of in and increases to of the applicable res requirement in and subsequent years 
if aps fails to implement any of its annual acc approved renewable implementation plans  it may be subject to penalties imposed by the acc  including aps s inability to recover certain costs 
compliance with the distributed resource requirement is contingent upon customer participation 
the development of any renewable generation facilities resulting from the res is subject to many other risks  including risks relating to financing  permitting  technology  fuel supply  and the construction of sufficient transmission capacity to support these facilities 
deregulation or restructuring of the electric industry may result in increased competition  which could have a significant adverse impact on aps s business and its results of operations 
in  the acc approved rules for the introduction of retail electric competition in arizona 
retail competition could have a significant adverse financial impact on aps due to an impairment of assets  a loss of retail customers  lower profit margins or increased costs of capital 
although some very limited retail competition existed in aps s service area in and  there are currently no active retail competitors offering unbundled energy or other utility services to aps s customers 
as a result  aps cannot predict if  when  and the extent to which  additional competitors may re enter aps s service territory 
in  the acc issued a decision holding that solar vendors that install and operate solar facilities for non profit schools and governments pursuant to a specific type of contract that calculates payments based on the energy produced are not public service corporations under the arizona constitution  and are therefore not regulated by the acc 
a second matter is pending with the acc to determine whether that ruling should extend to solar providers who serve a broader customer base under the same business model 
the use of such products by customers within our territory would result in some level of competition 
aps cannot predict whether the acc will deem these vendors public service corporations subject to acc regulation and when  and the extent to which  additional service providers will enter aps s service territory  increasing the level of competition in the market 

table of contents operational risks aps s results of operations can be adversely affected by various factors impacting demand for electricity 
weather conditions 
weather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and affect the price of energy commodities 
electric power demand is generally a seasonal business 
in arizona  demand for power peaks during the hot summer months  with market prices also peaking at that time 
as a result  aps s overall operating results fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis 
in addition  aps has historically sold less power  and consequently earned less income  when weather conditions are milder 
as a result  unusually mild weather could diminish aps s results of operations 
higher temperatures may decrease the snowpack  which might result in lowered soil moisture and an increased threat of forest fires 
forest fires could threaten aps s communities and electric transmission lines 
any damage caused as a result of forest fires could negatively impact aps s results of operations 
effects of energy conservation measures and distributed energy 
the acc has enacted rules regarding energy efficiency that mandate a annual energy savings requirement by this will likely increase participation by aps customers in energy efficiency and conservation programs and other demand side management efforts  which in turn will impact the demand for electricity 
the rules also include a requirement for the acc to review and address financial disincentives  recovery of fixed costs and the recovery of net lost income revenue that would result from lower sales due to increased energy efficiency requirements 
to that end  the acc passed a policy statement on per customer revenue decoupling in december of the policy statement will have no effect on aps s rates unless implemented in a rate case 
the retail rate case settlement agreement also establishes energy efficiency goals for aps that begin in that extend through  subjecting aps to energy efficiency requirements slightly greater for those years than required under the rules described above 
aps must also meet certain distributed energy requirements 
a portion of aps s total renewable energy requirement must be met with an increasing percentage of distributed energy resources generally  small scale renewable technologies located on customers properties 
the distributed energy requirement is of the overall res requirement of in and increases to of the applicable res requirement in and subsequent years 
customer participation in distributed energy programs would result in lower demand  since customers would be meeting some or all of their own energy needs 
reduced demand due to these energy efficiency and distributed energy requirements  unless offset through ratemaking mechanisms  could have a material adverse impact on aps s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the operation of power generation facilities involves risks that could result in unscheduled power outages or reduced output  which could materially affect aps s results of operations 
the operation of power generation facilities involves certain risks  including the risk of breakdown or failure of equipment  fuel interruption  and performance below expected levels of output or efficiency 
unscheduled outages  including extensions of scheduled outages due to mechanical failures or other complications  occur from time to time and are an inherent risk of aps s business 
if aps s facilities operate below expectations  especially during its peak seasons  it may lose revenue or incur additional expenses  including increased purchased power expenses 

table of contents the lack of access to sufficient supplies of water could have a material adverse impact on aps s business and results of operations 
assured supplies of water are important for aps s generating plants 
water in the southwestern united states is limited and various parties have made conflicting claims regarding the right to access and use such limited supply of water 
both groundwater and surface water in areas important to aps s generating plants have been and are the subject of inquiries  claims and legal proceedings 
in addition  the four corners region  in which four corners is located  has been experiencing drought conditions that may affect the water supply for the plants if adequate moisture is not received in the watershed that supplies the area 
aps s inability to access sufficient supplies of water could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 
the ownership and operation of power generation and transmission facilities on indian lands could result in uncertainty related to continued leases  easements and rights of way  which could have a significant impact on our business 
certain aps power plants  including four corners  and portions of the transmission lines that carry power from these plants are located on indian lands pursuant to leases  easements or other rights of way that are effective for specified periods 
aps is currently unable to predict the final outcome of discussions with the appropriate indian tribes and approval by their respective governing bodies with respect to renewals of these leases  easements and rights of way 
there are inherent risks in the ownership and operation of nuclear facilities  such as environmental  health  fuel supply  spent fuel disposal  regulatory and financial risks and the risk of terrorist attack 
aps has an ownership interest in and operates  on behalf of a group of participants  palo verde  which is the largest nuclear electric generating facility in the united states 
palo verde is subject to environmental  health and financial risks such as the ability to obtain adequate supplies of nuclear fuel  the ability to dispose of spent nuclear fuel  the ability to maintain adequate reserves for decommissioning  potential liabilities arising out of the operation of these facilities  the costs of securing the facilities against possible terrorist attacks  and unscheduled outages due to equipment and other problems 
aps maintains nuclear decommissioning trust funds and external insurance coverage to minimize its financial exposure to some of these risks  however  it is possible that damages could exceed the amount of insurance coverage 
in addition  aps may be required under federal law to pay up to million but not more than million per year of liabilities arising out of a nuclear incident occurring not only at palo verde  but at any other nuclear power plant in the united states 
although we have no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at palo verde  if an incident did occur  it could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
a major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the nrc to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit 
the operation of palo verde requires licenses that need to be periodically renewed and or extended 
in december  aps applied for renewed operating licenses for all three palo verde units for years beyond the expirations of the current licenses 
aps does not anticipate any problems renewing these licenses 
however  as a result of potential terrorist threats and increased public scrutiny of utilities  the licensing process could result in increased licensing or compliance costs that are difficult to predict 

table of contents the use of derivative contracts in the normal course of our business could result in financial losses that negatively impact our results of operations 
aps s operations include managing market risks related to commodity prices 
aps is exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the price and transportation costs of electricity  natural gas and coal to the extent that unhedged positions exist 
we have established procedures to manage risks associated with these market fluctuations by utilizing various commodity derivatives  including exchange traded futures and options and over the counter forwards  options  and swaps 
as part of our overall risk management program  we enter into derivative transactions to hedge purchases and sales of electricity and fuels 
the changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to price changes in the hedged commodity 
to the extent that commodity markets are illiquid  we may not be able to execute our risk management strategies  which could result in greater unhedged positions than we would prefer at a given time and financial losses that negatively impact our results of operations 
the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank act  which was signed into law in july  contains measures aimed at increasing the transparency and stability of the over the counter  or otc  derivative markets and preventing excessive speculation 
the dodd frank act could restrict  among other things  trading positions in the energy futures markets  require different collateral or settlement positions  or increase regulatory reporting over derivative positions 
based on the provisions included in the dodd frank act and the implementation of regulations yet to be developed  these changes could  among other things  impact our ability to hedge commodity price and interest rate risk or increase the costs associated with our hedging programs 
we are exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance or nonpayment by counterparties 
we use a risk management process to assess and monitor the financial exposure of all counterparties 
despite the fact that the majority of aps s trading counterparties are rated as investment grade by the rating agencies  there is still a possibility that one or more of these companies could default  which could result in a material adverse impact on our earnings for a given period 
changes in technology could create challenges for aps s existing business 
research and development activities are ongoing to assess alternative technologies that produce power or reduce power consumption  including clean coal and coal gasification  renewable technologies including photovoltaic solar cells  customer sited generation solar and efficiency technologies  and improvements in traditional technologies and equipment  such as more efficient gas turbines 
advances in these  or other technologies could reduce the cost of power production  making aps s existing generating facilities less economical 
in addition  advances in technology could reduce the demand for power supply  which could adversely affect aps s business 
aps is pursuing and implementing smart grid technologies  including advanced transmission and distribution system technologies  digital meters enabling two way communications between the utility and its customers  and electric usage monitoring devices for customers homes and businesses 
many of the products and processes resulting from these and other alternative technologies have not yet been widely used or tested  and their use on large scale systems is not as advanced and established as aps s existing technologies and equipment 
uncertainties and unknowns related to these and other advancements in technology and equipment could adversely affect aps s business if national standards develop that do not embrace the current technologies or if the technologies and equipment fail to perform as expected 
in addition  widespread installation and acceptance of these devices could enable the entry of new market participants  such as technology companies  into the interface between aps and its customers 

table of contents we are subject to employee workforce factors that could adversely affect our business and financial condition 
like most companies in the electric utility industry  our workforce is aging and a number of our employees will become eligible to retire within the next few years 
although we have undertaken efforts to recruit and train new employees  we may not be successful 
we are subject to other employee workforce factors  such as the availability of qualified personnel  the need to negotiate collective bargaining agreements with union employees and potential work stoppages 
exposure to these or other employee workforce factors could negatively impact our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we are subject to information security risks 
in the regular course of our business we handle a range of sensitive security and customer information 
we are subject to laws and rules issued by different agencies concerning safeguarding and maintaining the confidentiality of this information 
a security breach of our information systems such as theft or the inappropriate release of certain types of information  including confidential customer information or system operating information could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition 
financial risks financial market disruptions may increase our financing costs or limit our access to the credit and capital markets  which may adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to implement our financial strategy 
we rely on access to short term money markets  longer term capital markets and the bank market as a significant source of liquidity and for capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flow from our operations 
we believe that we will maintain sufficient access to these financial markets 
however  certain market disruptions may increase our cost of borrowing or adversely affect our ability to access one or more financial markets 
such disruptions could include continuation of the current economic downturn  terrorist attacks or threatened attacks  mergers among financial institutions and the overall health of the banking industry  or the overall health of the utility industry 
in addition  the credit commitments of our lenders under our bank facilities may not be satisfied for a variety of reasons  including unexpected periods of financial distress affecting our lenders  which could materially adversely affect the adequacy of our liquidity sources 

table of contents changes in economic conditions could result in higher interest rates  which would increase our interest expense on our debt and reduce funds available to us for our current plans 
additionally  an increase in our leverage could adversely affect us by reducing our credit ratings  increasing the cost of future debt financing and refinancing  increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions  and requiring us to dedicate an increased portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt  which would reduce funds available to us for operations  future business opportunities or other purposes 
a reduction in our credit ratings could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our current ratings are set forth in liquidity and capital resources credit ratings in item we cannot be sure that any of our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if  in its judgment  circumstances in the future so warrant 
any downgrade or withdrawal could adversely affect the market price of pinnacle west s and aps s securities  limit our access to capital and increase our borrowing costs  which would diminish our financial results 
we would be required to pay a higher interest rate in future financings  and our potential pool of investors and funding sources could decrease 
in addition  borrowing costs under certain of our existing credit facilities depend on our credit ratings 
a downgrade would also require us to provide substantial additional support in the form of letters of credit or cash or other collateral to various counterparties 
if our short term ratings were to be lowered  it could completely eliminate any possible future access to the commercial paper market 
we note that the ratings from rating agencies are not recommendations to buy  sell or hold our securities and that each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
market performance  changing interest rates and other economic factors could decrease the value of our benefit plan assets and nuclear decommissioning trust funds and increase our related obligations  resulting in significant additional funding that could negatively impact our business 
disruptions in the capital markets and or decline in market value may adversely affect the values of fixed income and equity investments held in our employee benefit plan trusts and nuclear decommissioning trusts 
we have significant obligations in these areas and hold substantial assets in these trusts 
a decline in the market value of the investments in these trusts may increase our funding requirements 
additionally  the pension plan and other postretirement benefit liabilities are impacted by the discount rate  which is the interest rate used to discount future pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 
declining interest rates impact the discount rate  and may result in increases in pension and other postretirement benefit costs  cash contributions  regulatory assets  and charges to other comprehensive income 
changes in demographics  including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions  may also increase the funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
a significant portion of the pension costs and other postretirement benefit costs and all of the nuclear decommissioning costs are recovered in regulated electricity prices 
our inability to fully recover these costs in a timely manner or any increased funding obligations could negatively impact our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents we may be required to adopt ifrs 
the ultimate adoption of such standards could negatively impact our business  financial condition or results of operations 
ifrs is a comprehensive series of accounting standards published by the international accounting standards board iasb that is being considered by the sec to replace accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap for use in preparation of financial statements 
if the sec requires mandatory adoption of ifrs  we may lose our ability to use regulatory accounting treatment  and would follow ifrs rather than gaap for the preparation of our financial statements beginning in in the meantime  the fasb and the iasb are working on several accounting standards jointly to converge certain accounting differences before the implementation and adoption of these new standards and the inability to use regulatory accounting could negatively impact our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our cash flow largely depends on the performance of aps 
we conduct our operations primarily through our subsidiary  aps 
substantially all of our consolidated assets are held by aps 
accordingly  our cash flow is dependent upon the earnings and cash flows of aps and its distributions to us 
aps is a separate and distinct legal entity and has no obligation to make distributions to us 
aps s debt agreements may restrict its ability to pay dividends  make distributions or otherwise transfer funds to us 
in addition  an acc financing order requires aps to maintain a common equity ratio of at least and does not allow aps to pay common dividends if the payment would reduce its common equity below that threshold 
the common equity ratio  as defined in the acc order  is total shareholder equity divided by the sum of total shareholder equity and long term debt  including current maturities of long term debt 
pinnacle west s ability to meet its debt service obligations could be adversely affected because its debt securities are structurally subordinated to the debt securities and other obligations of its subsidiaries 
because pinnacle west is structured as a holding company  all existing and future debt and other liabilities of our subsidiaries will be effectively senior in right of payment to our debt securities 
the assets and cash flows of our subsidiaries will be available  in the first instance  to service their own debt and other obligations 
our ability to have the benefit of their assets and cash flows  particularly in the case of any insolvency or financial distress affecting our subsidiaries  would arise only through our equity ownership interests in our subsidiaries and only after their creditors have been satisfied 
the market price of our common stock may be volatile 
the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to factors such as the following  some of which are beyond our control variations in our quarterly operating results  operating results that vary from the expectations of management  securities analysts and investors  changes in expectations as to our future financial performance  including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors  
table of contents developments generally affecting industries in which we operate  particularly the energy distribution and energy generation industries  announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts  acquisitions  joint marketing relationships  joint ventures or capital commitments  announcements by third parties of significant claims or proceedings against us  favorable or adverse regulatory or legislative developments  our dividend policy  future sales by the company of equity or equity linked securities  and general domestic and international economic conditions 
in addition  the stock market in general has experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and of arizona law make it difficult for shareholders to change the composition of our board and may discourage takeover attempts 
these provisions  which could preclude our shareholders from receiving a change of control premium  include the following restrictions on our ability to engage in a wide range of business combination transactions with an interested shareholder generally  any person who owns or more of our outstanding voting power or any of our affiliates or associates or any affiliate or associate of an interested shareholder  unless specific conditions are met  anti greenmail provisions of arizona law and our bylaws that prohibit us from purchasing shares of our voting stock from beneficial owners of more than of our outstanding shares unless specified conditions are satisfied  the ability of the board of directors to increase the size of the board and fill vacancies on the board  whether resulting from such increase  or from death  resignation  disqualification or otherwise  and the ability of our board of directors to issue additional shares of common stock and shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and  with respect to preferred stock  the other terms  including preferences and voting rights  of those shares without shareholder approval 
while these provisions have the effect of encouraging persons seeking to acquire control of us to negotiate with our board of directors  they could enable the board to hinder or frustrate a transaction that some  or a majority  of our shareholders might believe to be in their best interests and  in that case  may prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors 
suncor s continuing wind down of its real estate business may give rise to various claims 
since  suncor has been engaged in a program to dispose of its homebuilding operations  master planned communities  land parcels  commercial assets and golf courses in order to reduce its outstanding debt 
as of december   suncor had no existing bank debt and had total assets remaining on its books of million  consisting of million of intercompany receivables  million of assets held for sale and million of other assets 
suncor is focusing on concluding an orderly wind down of its business 
this effort includes addressing contingent liabilities  such as warranty and construction claims that may be brought by property owners and potential funding obligations to local taxing districts that financed infrastructure at certain of its real estate developments 
pinnacle west has not guaranteed any of suncor s obligations 
suncor s remaining business operations  and its ability to generate cash from operations  are minimal 
as a result  suncor may seek judicial protection to effectuate a resolution of any claims that cannot be successfully addressed by other means 
in such event  pinnacle west could be exposed to the uncertainties and complexities inherent for parent companies in such proceedings

aps s transmission facilities consist of approximately  pole miles of overhead lines and approximately miles of underground lines   miles of which are located in arizona 
aps s distribution facilities consist of approximately  miles of overhead lines and approximately  miles of underground primary cable  all of which are located in arizona 
aps shares ownership of some of its transmission facilities with other companies

each year aps prepares and files with the acc a ten year transmission plan 
in aps s plan  aps projects it will invest approximately million in new transmission over the next ten years  which includes miles of new lines 
this investment will increase the import capability into metropolitan phoenix by approximately and will increase the import capability into the yuma area by approximately 
one significant project presently nearing completion is the morgan pinnacle peak project  which consists of miles of kv and kv lines 
aps continues to work with regulators to identify transmission projects necessary to support renewable energy facilities 
two such projects  which are included in aps s transmission plan  are the delany to palo verde line and the north gila to palo verde line  both of which are intended to support the transmission of renewable energy to phoenix and california 

table of contents plant and transmission line leases and easements on indian lands the navajo plant and four corners are located on land held under leases from the navajo nation and also under easements from the federal government 
the easement and lease for the navajo plant expire in and the easement and lease for four corners expire in each of the leases contains an option to extend for an additional year period from the end of the existing lease term  for a rental amount tied to the original rent payment adjusted based on an index 
the easements do not contain an express renewal option and it is unclear what conditions to renewal or extension of the easements may be imposed 
aps is currently working with the navajo nation to extend the four corners leases and the transmission rights of way discussed below for an additional twenty five years 
see business of arizona public service company energy sources and resource planning generation facilities coal fueled generating facilities in item for details of this extension and the related required approvals 
the ultimate cost of renewal of the navajo plant and four corners leases and easements is uncertain 
the coal contracted for use in these plants is also located on indian reservations 
certain portions of the transmission lines that carry power from several of our power plants are located on indian lands pursuant to easements or other rights of way that are effective for specified periods 
some of these rights of way have expired and our renewal applications have not yet been acted upon by the appropriate indian tribes 
other rights expire at various times in the future and renewal action by the applicable tribe will be required at that time 
the majority of our transmission lines residing on indian lands are on the navajo nation 
the four corners and navajo plant leases provide navajo nation consent to certain of the rights of way for transmission lines related to those plants at a specified rental rate for the original term of the rights of way and for a like payment in any renewal period 
in addition  a amendment to the leases provides a formula for calculating payments for certain new and renewal rights of way 
however  some of our rights of way are not covered by the leases  or are granted by other indian tribes 
in recent negotiations with other utilities or companies for renewal of similar rights of way  certain of the affected indian tribes have required payments substantially in excess of amounts that we have paid in the past for such rights of way or that are typical for similar permits across non indian lands  however  we are unaware of the underlying agreements and or specific circumstances surrounding these renewals 
the ultimate cost of renewal of the rights of way for our transmission lines is uncertain 
we are monitoring these rights of way and easement issues and have had extensive discussions with the navajo nation regarding them 
we are currently unable to predict the outcome of this matter

for information on the broad factors that may cause our actual future results to differ from those we currently seek or anticipate  see forward looking statements at the front of this report and risk factors in item a 
overview pinnacle west owns all of the outstanding common stock of aps 
aps is a vertically integrated electric utility that provides either retail or wholesale electric service to most of the state of arizona  with the major exceptions of about one half of the phoenix metropolitan area  the tucson metropolitan area and mohave county in northwestern arizona 
aps accounts for substantially all of our revenues and earnings  and is expected to continue to do so 
areas of business focus operational performance  reliability and recent developments 
nuclear 
in  palo verde achieved its best generation year ever  producing over million megawatt hours  with an overall station capacity factor of 
the generation from each palo verde operating unit directly reflects the station s currently effective month refueling cycle 
in  palo verde successfully refueled both unit and unit as part of the refueling outages  palo verde installed new reactor vessel closure heads and simplified head assembly modifications 
these projects are designed to provide safety benefits  eliminate costly inspections and reduce the duration of future outages 
coal and related environmental matters 
aps operated coal plants  four corners and cholla  achieved net capacity factors of and  respectively  in aps is focused on the impacts on its coal fleet that may result from potential legislation and increased regulation concerning greenhouse gas emissions 
recent concern over climate change and other emission related issues could have a significant impact on our capital expenditures and operating costs in the form of taxes  emissions allowances or required equipment upgrades for these plants 
aps is closely monitoring its long range capital management plans  understanding that any resulting legislation and regulation could impact the economic viability of certain plants  as well as the willingness or ability of power plant participants to fund any such equipment upgrades 
in particular  on october   the epa issued its proposed determination for best available retrofit technology bart requirements for four corners that  as proposed  would require installation of additional pollution control equipment on all five of the plant s units 
based on aps s current ownership share of four corners  aps currently estimates that its total costs for the proposed controls could be up to approximately million for nitrogen oxide controls and about million for particulate removal equipment 
it is currently evaluating the impacts of the proposed determination and intends to submit comments during the epa s comment period 
see business of arizona public service company environmental matters in item and environmental and climate change related risks described in item a for additional environmental and climate change developments and risks facing aps 

table of contents in addition  sce  a participant in four corners  has indicated that certain california legislation may prohibit it from making emission control expenditures at the plant 
on november   aps and sce entered into an asset purchase agreement  providing for the purchase by aps of sce s interest in each of units and of four corners 
the purchase price is million  subject to certain adjustments 
completion of the purchase by aps  which is expected to occur in the second half of  is subject to the receipt of approvals by the acc  the california public utilities commission and the ferc 
aps and sce filed applications with their respective commissions seeking requisite authority or approvals to complete the transaction 
closing is also conditioned on the execution of a new coal supply contract for the lease renewal period described below  expiration of the waiting period under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act and other typical closing conditions 
aps  on behalf of the four corners participants  has negotiated amendments to an existing facility lease with the navajo nation which would extend the four corners leasehold interest to execution by the navajo nation of the lease amendments is a condition to closing of the purchase by aps of sce s interests in four corners 
the execution of these amendments by the navajo nation requires the approval of the navajo nation council  which occurred on february  and is awaiting final signature by the nation s president 
the effectiveness of the amendments also requires the approval of the doi  as does a related federal rights of way grant which the four corners participants will pursue 
a federal environmental review will be conducted as part of the doi review process 
pursuant to a co tenancy agreement among the four corners participants  the other participants have a right of first refusal to purchase shares of sce s interests proportional to their current ownership percentages 
the exercise of this purchase right by any of the other participants must be exercised by march  if any of the purchase rights are exercised  the amount available for purchase by aps would be reduced 
at this time aps does not know whether any of the other participants will exercise the right of first refusal 
aps has announced that  if aps s purchase of sce s interests in units and at four corners is consummated  it will close units  and at the plant 
these events will change the plant s overall generating capacity from  mw to  mw and aps s entitlement from the plant from mw to mw 
when applying for approval to purchase units and  aps also requested from the acc recovery of any unrecovered costs associated with the closure of units  and transmission and delivery 
in the area of transmission and delivery to its customers  aps ranked favorably during  with top quartile performance for average customer outage time and its best reliability year to date 
during  aps undertook several significant transmission projects  including the morgan to pinnacle peak transmission line scheduled for completion in aps s transmission plan projects that it will invest approximately million in new transmission over the next ten years  which includes miles of new lines 
the first three years of these additions are included in the capital expenditures table presented in the liquidity section below along with other transmission costs for upgrades and replacements 
aps is working closely with regulators to identify and plan for transmission needs resulting from the current focus on renewable energy 
aps is also working to establish and expand smart grid technology throughout its service territory designed to provide long term benefits both to aps and its customers 
aps is piloting and deploying a variety of technologies that are intended to allow customers to better monitor their energy use and needs  minimize system outage durations and the number of customers that experience outages  and facilitate cost savings to aps through improved reliability and the automation of certain distribution functions  including remote meter reading and remote connects and disconnects 

table of contents renewable energy 
the acc approved the res in  recognizing the importance of renewable energy to our state 
the renewable energy requirement is of retail electric sales in and increases annually until it reaches in in the retail rate case settlement agreement  aps agreed to exceed the res standards  committing to  gwh of new renewable resources to be in service by year end in addition to its renewable resource commitments 
taken together  aps s commitment is estimated to be  gwh or approximately of aps s retail energy sales by year end  which is double the existing res target of for that year 
see note a component of the res is focused on stimulating development of distributed energy systems generally speaking  small scale renewable technologies that are located on customers properties 
aps has a diverse portfolio of existing and planned renewable resources totaling mw  including solar  wind  geothermal  biomass and biogas 
of this portfolio  mw are currently in operation and mw are under contract for development or are under construction 
renewable resources in operation include mw of utility scale facilities owned by aps  mw of long term purchased power agreements  and an estimated mw of customer sited  third party owned distributed energy resources 
to achieve our res requirements  as mentioned above  to date aps has entered into contracts for mw of renewable resources that are planned  in development or under construction 
aps s strategy to procure these resources includes new facilities to be owned by aps  purchased power contracts for new facilities and ongoing development of distributed energy resources 
through the az sun program  approved by the acc on march   aps plans to own mw of solar photovoltaic power plants across arizona by investing up to million through under this program  aps has executed contracts for the development of mw of new solar generation  representing an investment commitment of approximately million 
see note for additional details of the az sun program  including the related cost recovery 
aps has also entered into long term purchased power agreements for mw from solar  wind and biogas facilities currently planned  in development or under construction  and mw from distributed energy resources 
agreements for the development and completion of future resources are subject to various conditions  including successful siting  permitting and interconnection of the project to the electric grid 
aps continues to actively consider opportunities to enhance its renewable energy portfolio  both to ensure its compliance with the renewable energy standard and to meet the needs of its customer base 
demand side management 
arizona regulators are placing an increased focus on energy efficiency and other demand side management programs to encourage customers to conserve energy  while incentivizing utilities to aid in these efforts that ultimately reduce the demand for energy 
in december  the acc initiated energy efficiency rulemaking  with a proposed energy efficiency standard of cumulative annual energy savings by the figure represents the cumulative reduction in future energy usage through attributable to energy efficiency initiatives 
on july   the proposed energy efficiency standard was adopted by the acc  approved by the arizona attorney general and became effective on january  this ambitious standard will likely impact arizona s future energy resource needs 

table of contents rate matters 
aps needs timely recovery through rates of its capital and operating expenditures to maintain adequate financial health 
aps s retail rates are regulated by the acc and its wholesale electric rates primarily for transmission are regulated by the ferc 
at the end of  the acc approved a settlement agreement entered into by aps and twenty one of the twenty three other parties to aps s general retail rate case  with modifications that did not materially affect the overall economic terms of the agreement 
the rate case settlement authorizes and requires equity infusions into aps of at least million prior to the end of the settlement demonstrated cooperation among aps  the acc staff  the residential utility consumer office ruco and other intervenors to the rate case  and establishes a future rate case filing plan that allows aps the opportunity to help shape arizona s energy future outside of continual rate cases 
see note for a detailed discussion of the settlement agreement terms and information on aps s ferc rates 
aps has several recovery mechanisms in place that provide more timely recovery to aps of its fuel and transmission costs  and costs associated with the promotion and implementation of its demand side management and renewable energy efforts and customer programs 
these mechanisms are described more fully in note on october   the chairman of the acc issued a draft decoupling policy statement for consideration by the commission 
on december  the acc unanimously approved a slightly modified decoupling policy statement supportive of using a revenue per customer methodology  which is the mechanism aps and a number of other parties support 
decoupling refers to a ratemaking design which reduces or removes the linkage between sales and utility revenues and or profits  reducing utility disincentives to the adoption of programs that benefit customers by saving energy 
mechanically  decoupling compares actual versus authorized revenues or revenue per customer over a period and either credits or collects any differences from customers in a subsequent period 
the policy permits regulated utilities to file a decoupling proposal in their next general rate case 
aps intends to include a decoupling model consistent with the policy statement for consideration in its upcoming general rate case  currently expected to be filed in june financial strength and flexibility 
pinnacle west and aps currently have ample borrowing capacity under their respective credit facilities and have been able to access these facilities  ensuring adequate liquidity for each company 
in early february  aps entered into a million revolving credit facility  replacing its million revolving credit facility that would have otherwise terminated in december at that same time  pinnacle west entered into a million revolving credit facility that replaced its million facility that also would have otherwise terminated in december since march  pinnacle west and aps have accessed the commercial paper market  which neither company had utilized since the third quarter of due to negative market conditions 
in april  pinnacle west issued  shares of common stock at an offering price of per share  resulting in net proceeds of approximately million 
pinnacle west contributed all of the net proceeds from this offering into aps in the form of equity infusions 
aps has used these capital contributions to repay short term indebtedness  to finance capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes 
in early february  aps entered into a million revolving credit facility  replacing its million revolving credit facility that would have otherwise terminated in september suncor real estate operations 
as a result of the continuing distressed conditions in the real estate markets  during suncor undertook a program to dispose of its homebuilding operations  master planned communities  land parcels  commercial assets and golf courses in order to reduce its outstanding debt 
at december   suncor had total remaining assets of about million  which includes approximately million of assets held for sale

table of contents district cooling business sale 
on june   apses sold its district cooling business consisting of operations in downtown phoenix  tucson  and on certain arizona state university campuses 
the sale resulted in an after tax gain of approximately million 
apses is now focused on its core business of energy conservation and renewable energy contracting services 
subsidiaries 
the operations of apses and our other first tier subsidiary  el dorado  are not expected to have any material impact on our financial results  or to require any material amounts of capital  over the next three years 
key financial drivers in addition to the continuing impact of the matters described above  many factors influence our financial results and our future financial outlook  including those listed below 
we closely monitor these factors to plan for the company s current needs  and to adjust our expectations  financial budgets and forecasts appropriately 
electric operating revenues 
for the years through  retail electric revenues comprised approximately of our total electric operating revenues 
our electric operating revenues are affected by customer growth or decline  variations in weather from period to period  customer mix  average usage per customer and the impacts of energy efficiency programs  electricity rates and tariffs  the recovery of psa deferrals and the operation of other recovery mechanisms 
off system sales of excess generation output  purchased power and natural gas are included in regulated electricity segment revenues and related fuel and purchased power because they are credited to aps s retail customers through the psa 
these revenue transactions are affected by the availability of excess generation or other energy resources and wholesale market conditions  including competition  demand and prices 
customer and sales growth 
customer growth in aps s service territory for the year ended december  was compared with the prior year 
for the three years through  aps s customer growth averaged per year 
we currently expect customer growth to average about per year for through due to anticipated improving economic conditions both nationally and in arizona 
retail sales in kilowatt hours  adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations  for declined compared to the prior year  reflecting the poor economic conditions in and the effects of our energy efficiency programs 
for the three years through  aps s actual retail electricity sales in kilowatt hours  adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations  declined at an average annual rate of 
we currently estimate that total retail electricity sales in kilowatt hours will remain flat on average per year during through  including the effects of aps s energy efficiency programs  but excluding the effects of weather variations 
a continuation of the economic downturn  or the failure of the arizona economy to rebound in the near future  could further impact these estimates 
the customer and sales growth referred to in this paragraph apply to native load customers 
actual sales growth  excluding weather related variations  may differ from our projections as a result of numerous factors  such as economic conditions  customer growth  usage patterns  impacts of energy efficiency programs and responses to retail price changes 
our experience indicates that a reasonable range of variation in our kilowatt hour sales projection attributable to such economic factors under normal business conditions can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of up to million 
weather 
in forecasting the retail sales growth numbers provided above  we assume normal weather patterns based on historical data 
historical extreme weather variations have resulted in annual variations in net income in excess of million 
however  our experience indicates that the more typical variations from normal weather can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of up to million 

table of contents fuel and purchased power costs 
fuel and purchased power costs included on our consolidated statements of income are impacted by our electricity sales volumes  existing contracts for purchased power and generation fuel  our power plant performance  transmission availability or constraints  prevailing market prices  new generating plants being placed in service in our market areas  our hedging program for managing such costs and psa deferrals and the related amortization 
operations and maintenance expenses 
operations and maintenance expenses are impacted by growth  power plant operations  maintenance of utility plant including generation  transmission  and distribution facilities  inflation  outages  higher trending pension and other postretirement benefit costs  renewable energy and demand side management related expenses which are offset by the same amount of regulated electricity segment operating revenues and other factors 
in its retail rate case settlement  aps committed to operational expense reductions from through and received approval to defer certain pension and other postretirement benefit cost increases to be incurred in and depreciation and amortization expenses 
depreciation and amortization expenses are impacted by net additions to utility plant and other property such as new generation  transmission  and distribution facilities  and changes in depreciation and amortization rates 
see capital expenditures below for information regarding the planned additions to our facilities 
we have also applied to the nrc for renewed operating licenses for each of the palo verde units 
if the nrc grants the extension  we estimate that our annual pretax depreciation expense will decrease by approximately million at the later of the license extension date or january  property taxes 
taxes other than income taxes consist primarily of property taxes  which are affected by the value of property in service and under construction  assessment ratios  and tax rates 
the average property tax rate for aps  which currently owns the majority of our property  was of the assessed value in  of the assessed value in and of the assessed value in we expect property taxes to increase as we add new utility plants including new generation  transmission and distribution facilities described below under capital additions and as we improve our existing facilities 
income taxes 
income taxes are affected by the amount of pre tax book income  income tax rates  and certain non taxable items  such as the afudc 
in addition  income taxes may also be affected by the settlement of issues with taxing authorities 
interest expense 
interest expense is affected by the amount of debt outstanding and the interest rates on that debt see note the primary factors affecting borrowing levels are expected to be our capital expenditures  long term debt maturities  equity issuances and internally generated cash flow 
an allowance for borrowed funds offsets a portion of interest expense while capital projects are under construction 
we stop accruing afudc on a project when it is placed in commercial operation

debt provisions pinnacle west s and aps s debt covenants related to their respective bank financing arrangements include maximum debt to capitalization ratios 
pinnacle west and aps comply with this covenant and each anticipates it will continue to meet this and other significant covenant requirements 
for both pinnacle west and aps  this covenant requires that the ratio of consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization not exceed 
at december   the ratio was approximately for pinnacle west and for aps 
failure to comply with such covenant levels would result in an event of default which  generally speaking  would require the immediate repayment of the debt subject to the covenants and could cross default other debt 
see further discussion of cross default provisions below 

table of contents neither pinnacle west s nor aps s financing agreements contain rating triggers that would result in an acceleration of the required interest and principal payments in the event of a rating downgrade 
however  our bank credit agreements contain a pricing grid in which the interest rates we pay for borrowings thereunder are determined by our current credit ratings 
all of pinnacle west s loan agreements contain cross default provisions that would result in defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under these loan agreements if pinnacle west or aps were to default under certain other material agreements

credit ratings the ratings of securities of pinnacle west and aps as of february  are shown below 
the ratings reflect the respective views of the rating agencies  from which an explanation of the significance of their ratings may be obtained 
there is no assurance that these ratings will continue for any given period of time 
the ratings may be revised or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if  in their respective judgments  circumstances so warrant 
any downward revision or withdrawal may adversely affect the market price of pinnacle west s or aps s securities and or result in an increase in the cost of  or limit access to  capital 
such revisions may also result in substantial additional cash or other collateral requirements related to certain derivative instruments  insurance policies  natural gas transportation  fuel supply  and other energy related contracts 
at this time  we believe we have sufficient liquidity to cover a downward revision to our credit ratings

critical accounting policies in preparing the financial statements in accordance with gaap  management must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period 
some of those judgments can be subjective and complex  and actual results could differ from those estimates 
we consider the following accounting policies to be our most critical because of the uncertainties  judgments and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved 

table of contents regulatory accounting regulatory accounting allows for the actions of regulators  such as the acc and the ferc  to be reflected in our financial statements 
their actions may cause us to capitalize costs that would otherwise be included as an expense in the current period by unregulated companies 
regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because they are probable of future recovery in customer rates 
regulatory liabilities generally represent expected future costs that have already been collected from customers 
management continually assesses whether our regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as applicable regulatory environment changes and recent rate orders to other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction 
this determination reflects the current political and regulatory climate in the state and is subject to change in the future 
if future recovery of costs ceases to be probable  the assets would be written off as a charge in current period earnings 
we had billion of regulatory assets and million of regulatory liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets at december  included in the balance of regulatory assets at december  is a regulatory asset of million for pension and other postretirement benefits 
this regulatory asset represents the future recovery of these costs through retail rates as these amounts are charged to earnings 
if these costs are disallowed by the acc  this regulatory asset would be charged to oci and result in lower future earnings 
see notes and for more information 
pensions and other postretirement benefit accounting changes in our actuarial assumptions used in calculating our pension and other postretirement benefit liability and expense can have a significant impact on our earnings and financial position 
the most relevant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate used to measure our liability and net periodic cost  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets used to estimate earnings on invested funds over the long term  and the assumed healthcare cost trend rates 
we review these assumptions on an annual basis and adjust them as necessary

table of contents derivative accounting derivative accounting requires evaluation of rules that are complex and subject to varying interpretations 
our evaluation of these rules  as they apply to our contracts  determines whether we use accrual accounting for contracts designated as normal or fair value mark to market accounting 
mark to market accounting requires that changes in the fair value are recognized periodically in income unless certain hedge criteria are met 
for cash flow hedges  the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized in common stock equity as a component of other comprehensive income loss and the ineffective portion is recognized in current earnings 
see market risks commodity price risk below for quantitative analysis 
see fair value measurements below for additional information on valuation 
see note for discussion on accounting policies and note for a further discussion on derivative accounting 
fair value measurements we apply recurring fair value measurements to derivative instruments  nuclear decommissioning trusts  certain cash equivalents and plan assets held in our retirement and other benefit plans 
fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
we use inputs  or assumptions that market participants would use  to determine fair market value 
the significance of a particular input determines how the instrument is classified in the fair value hierarchy 
we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
the determination of fair value sometimes requires subjective and complex judgment 
our assessment of the inputs and the significance of a particular input to fair value measurement may affect the valuation of the instruments and their placement within the fair value hierarchy 
actual results could differ from our estimates of fair value 
see note for further fair value measurement discussion  note for discussion on accounting policies and note for a further discussion on derivative accounting 
our nuclear decommissioning trusts invest in fixed income securities and equity securities 
the fair values of these securities are based on observable inputs for identical or similar assets 
see note for further discussion of our nuclear decommissioning trusts 
real estate investment impairments while we do not have any real estate investments or home inventory at december   we did have real estate investments of million and million of home inventory on our consolidated balance sheets at december  for purposes of evaluating impairment  in accordance with guidance on the impairment and disposal of long lived assets  we classified our real estate assets  such as land under development  land held for future development  and commercial property  as held and used 
when events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying value of real estate assets considered held and used were not recoverable  we compared the undiscounted cash flows that we estimated would be generated by each asset to its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount exceeded the undiscounted cash flows  we adjusted the asset to fair value and recognized an impairment charge 
the adjusted value became the new book value carrying amount for held and used assets 
we may have had real estate assets classified as held and used with fair values that were lower than their carrying amounts  but were not deemed to be impaired because the undiscounted cash flows exceeded the carrying amounts 

table of contents real estate home inventory was considered to be held for sale for the purposes of evaluating impairment 
home inventories were reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
fair value less cost to sell was evaluated each period to determine if it had changed 
losses and gains not to exceed any cumulative loss previously recognized were reported as adjustments to the carrying amount 
we determined fair value for our real estate assets primarily based on the future cash flows that we estimated would be generated by each asset discounted for market risk 
our impairment assessments and fair value determinations required significant judgment regarding key assumptions such as future sales prices  future construction and land development costs  future sales timing  and discount rates 
the assumptions were specific to each project and may have varied among projects 
the discount rates we used to determine fair values at december  ranged from to 
due to the judgment and assumptions applied in the estimation process  with regard to impairments  it is possible that actual results could have differed from those estimates 
other accounting matters on january  we adopted amended accounting guidance relating to vies and  as a result  we have consolidated certain entities which were previously not consolidated 
the consolidation of these entities has impacted our consolidated financial statements 
see notes  and for a discussion of these impacts

our risk management committee  consisting of officers and key management personnel  oversees company wide energy risk management activities to ensure compliance with our stated energy risk management policies 
we manage risks associated with these market fluctuations by utilizing various commodity instruments that qualify as derivatives  including exchange traded futures and options and over the counter forwards  options and swaps 
as part of our risk management program  we use such instruments to hedge purchases and sales of electricity and fuels 
the changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to price changes in the hedged commodities
