table of contents recently adopted accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new accounting guidance that amends the accounting and disclosure requirements for the consolidation of variable interest entities 
the implementation of the new accounting guidance related to variable interest entities  effective january   did not have a material impact on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the following paragraphs include a discussion of some critical areas that require a higher degree of judgment  estimates and complexity 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when title passes to the customer 
this occurs at the shipping point  except for certain exported goods and certain foreign entities  for which it occurs when the goods reach their destination 
selling prices are fixed based on purchase orders or contractual arrangements 
inventory inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  with approximately valued by the last in  first out lifo method and the remaining valued by the first in  first out fifo method 
the majority of the company s domestic inventories are valued by the lifo method and all of the company s international outside the united states inventories are valued by the fifo method 
an actual valuation of the inventory under the lifo method can be made only at the end of each year based on the inventory levels and costs at that time 
accordingly  interim lifo calculations are based on management s estimates of expected year end inventory levels and costs 
because these are subject to many factors beyond management s control  annual results may differ from interim results as they are subject to the final year end lifo inventory valuation 
the company recognized an increase in its lifo reserve of million for  compared to a decrease in its lifo reserve of million for goodwill the company tests goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually 
the company performs its annual impairment test during the fourth quarter after the annual forecasting process is completed 
furthermore  goodwill is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
each interim period  management of the company assesses whether or not an indicator of impairment is present that would necessitate that a goodwill impairment analysis be performed in an interim period other than during the fourth quarter 
the goodwill impairment analysis is a two step process 
step one compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value 
to the extent that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value  step two is performed  where the reporting unit s carrying value of goodwill is compared to the implied fair value of goodwill 
to the extent that the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill  impairment exists and must be recognized 
the company reviews goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level 
the company s reporting units are the same as its reportable segments mobile industries  process industries  aerospace and defense and steel 
the company prepares its goodwill impairment analysis by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit  using an income approach a discounted cash flow model as well as a market approach  with its carrying value 
the income approach and the market approach are equally weighted in arriving at fair value  which the company has applied consistently 
the discounted cash flow model requires several assumptions including future sales growth  ebit earnings before interest and taxes margins and capital expenditures 
the company s four reporting units each provide their forecast of results for the next three years 
these forecasts are the basis for the information used in the discounted cash flow model 
the discounted cash flow model also requires the use of a discount rate and a terminal revenue growth rate the revenue growth rate for the period beyond the three years forecasted by the reporting units  as well as projections of future operating margins for the period beyond the forecasted three years 
during the fourth quarter of  the company used a discount rate for each of its four reporting units of to and a terminal revenue growth rate ranging from to 
the difference in the discount rates and terminal revenue growth rates is based on the underlying markets and risks associated with each of the company s reporting units 
the market approach requires several assumptions including sales multiples and ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization multiples for comparable companies that operate in the same markets as the company s reporting units 
during the fourth quarter of  the company used sales multiples for its four reporting units ranging from to and ebitda multiples ranging from to the difference in the sales multiples and the ebitda multiples is due to the underlying markets associated with each of the company s reporting units 

table of contents as a result of the goodwill impairment analysis performed during the fourth quarter of  the company recognized no goodwill impairment charges for the year ended december  the mobile industries segment s has no carrying value of goodwill  as it was fully impaired in the fair value of each of the process industries and steel segments exceeded their carrying value by a significant amount 
as of december   the company had million of goodwill on its consolidated balance sheet  of which million was attributable to the aerospace and defense segment 
see note goodwill and other intangible assets in the notes to consolidated financial statements for the carrying amount of goodwill by segment 
the fair value of this reporting unit was million compared to a carrying value of million 
a basis point increase in the discount rate would have resulted in the aerospace and defense segment failing step one of the goodwill impairment analysis  which would have required the completion of step two of the goodwill impairment analysis to arrive at a potential goodwill impairment loss 
a  basis point decrease in the projected cash flows would have resulted in the aerospace and defense segment failing step one of the goodwill impairment analysis  which would have required the completion of step two of the goodwill impairment analysis to arrive at a potential goodwill impairment loss 
restructuring costs the company s policy is to recognize restructuring costs in accordance with accounting standards codification asc  exit or disposal cost obligations  and asc  compensation and non retirement post employment benefits 
detailed contemporaneous documentation is maintained and updated to ensure that accruals are properly supported 
if management determines that there is a change in estimate  the accruals are adjusted to reflect this change 
benefit plans the company sponsors a number of defined benefit pension plans that cover eligible associates 
the company also sponsors several funded and unfunded postretirement plans that provide health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retirees and their dependents 
these plans are accounted for in accordance with accounting rules for defined benefit pension plans and postemployment plans 
the measurement of liabilities related to these plans is based on management s assumptions related to future events  including discount rates  rates of return on pension plan assets  rates of compensation increases and health care cost trend rates 
management regularly evaluates these assumptions and adjusts them as required and appropriate 
other plan assumptions are also reviewed on a regular basis to reflect recent experience and the company s future expectations 
actual experience that differs from these assumptions may affect future liquidity  expense and the overall financial position of the company 
while the company believes that current assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in these assumptions may materially affect the company s pension and other postretirement employee benefit obligations and its future expense and cash flow 
a discount rate is used to calculate the present value of expected future pension and postretirement cash flows as of the measurement date 
the company establishes the discount rate by constructing a portfolio of high quality corporate bonds and matching the coupon payments and bond maturities to projected benefit payments under the company s pension and postretirement welfare plans 
the bonds included in the portfolio are generally non callable 
a lower discount rate will result in a higher benefit obligation  conversely  a higher discount rate will result in a lower benefit obligation 
the discount rate is also used to calculate the annual interest cost  which is a component of net periodic benefit cost 
for expense purposes in  the company applied a discount rate of for the defined benefit pension plans and for the postretirement welfare plans 
for expense purposes for  the company will apply a discount rate of for the defined benefit pension plans and for the postretirement welfare plans 
a 
percentage point reduction in the discount rate would increase pension expense by approximately million for the defined benefit pension plans and million for the postretirement welfare plans for the expected rate of return on plan assets is determined by analyzing the historical long term performance of the company s pension plan assets  as well as the mix of plan assets between equities  fixed income securities and other investments  the expected long term rate of return expected for those asset classes and long term inflation rates 
short term asset performance can differ significantly from the expected rate of return  especially in volatile markets 
a lower than expected rate of return on pension plan assets will increase pension expense and future contributions 
for expense purposes in  the company applied an expected rate of return of for the company s pension plan assets 
for expense purposes for  the company will apply an expected rate of return on plan assets of 
a 
percentage point reduction in the expected rate of return would increase pension expense by approximately million for in addition  at the end of the company established a veba for certain bargained associates retiree medical benefits 
beginning in  the company will apply an expected rate of return of to the veba assets for expense purposes 
the expected return will decrease expense for postretirement welfare benefits by approximately million in 
table of contents for measurement purposes for postretirement benefits  the company assumed a weighted average annual rate of increase in per capita cost health care cost trend rate for medical benefits of for  declining steadily for the next years to  and for prescription drug benefits for  declining steadily for the next years to 
the assumed health care cost trend rate may have a significant effect on the amounts reported 
a one percentage point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have increased the total service and interest cost components by million and would have increased the postretirement obligation by million 
a one percentage point decrease would provide corresponding reductions of million and million  respectively 
the patient protection and affordable care act ppaca was enacted on march  ppaca consists of a broad range of provisions that may impact future plan design and administrative cost 
the company s actuary determined the impact ppaca has on the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation  to the extent measurable 
the effect of ppaca resulted in an increase in the reported postretirement benefit obligation of approximately million 
the net periodic postretirement benefit cost for was not impacted by ppaca 
it has been estimated that the net periodic postretirement benefit cost will increase by approximately million to reflect the impact of ppaca 
the us medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of medicare act was signed into law on december  the medicare act provides for prescription drug benefits under medicare part d and contains a tax free subsidy to plan sponsors who provide actuarially equivalent prescription plans 
the company s actuary determined that the prescription drug benefit provided by the company s postretirement plan is considered to be actuarially equivalent to the benefit provided under the medicare act 
the effects of the medicare act include reductions to the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and net periodic postretirement benefit cost of million and million  respectively 
the expected medicare subsidy was million  of which million was received prior to december  income taxes the company  which is subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous non us jurisdictions  accounts for income taxes in accordance with asc  income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the company records valuation allowances against deferred tax assets by tax jurisdiction when it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 
in determining the need for a valuation allowance  the historical and projected financial performance of the entity recording the net deferred tax asset is considered along with any other pertinent information 
net deferred tax assets relate primarily to pension and postretirement benefit obligations in the united states  which the company believes are more likely than not to result in future tax benefits 
in the ordinary course of the company s business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate income tax determination is uncertain 
the company is regularly under audit by tax authorities 
accruals for uncertain tax positions are provided for in accordance with the requirements of asc the company records interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  valuation allowances against deferred tax assets  and accruals for uncertain tax positions 
other loss reserves the company has a number of loss exposures that are incurred in the ordinary course of business such as environmental claims  product liability  product warranty  litigation and accounts receivable reserves 
establishing loss reserves for these matters requires management s estimate and judgment with regards to risk exposure and ultimate liability or realization 
these loss reserves are reviewed periodically and adjustments are made to reflect the most recent facts and circumstances 
other matters foreign currency assets and liabilities of subsidiaries are translated at the rate of exchange in effect on the balance sheet date  income and expenses are translated at the average rates of exchange prevailing during the quarter 
related translation adjustments are reflected as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss

this legislation would be expected to eventually reduce any distributions in years beyond  with distributions eventually ceasing 
several countries have objected that this us legislation is not consistent with wto rulings  and have been granted retaliation rights by the wto  typically in the form of increased tariffs on some imported goods from the united states 
the european union and japan have been retaliating in this fashion against the operation of us law 
in  the us court of international trade cit ruled  in two separate decisions  that the procedure for determining recipients eligible to receive cdsoa distributions is unconstitutional 
in february  the us court of appeals for the federal circuit reversed both decisions of the cit 
in december  a plaintiff petitioned the us supreme court to hear a further appeal  but the supreme court declined the petition  allowing the appellate court reversals to stand 
there are  however  several remaining constitutional challenges to the cdsoa law that are now before the cit 
the company is unable to determine  at this time  what the ultimate outcome of litigation regarding cdsoa will be 
there are a number of factors that can affect whether the company receives any cdsoa distributions and the amount of such distributions in any given year 
these factors include  among other things  potential additional changes in the law  ongoing and potential additional legal challenges to the law and the administrative operation of the law 
accordingly  the company cannot reasonably estimate the amount of cdsoa distributions it will receive in future years  if any 
it is possible that court rulings might prevent the company from receiving any cdsoa distributions in and beyond 
any reduction of cdsoa distributions would reduce the company s earnings and cash flow 
quarterly dividend on february   the company s board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share 
the dividend will be paid on march  to shareholders of record as of february  this will be the th consecutive dividend paid on the common stock of the company

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk changes in short term interest rates related to several separate funding sources impact the company s earnings 
these sources are borrowings under an asset securitization agreement  borrowings under the million senior credit facility  floating rate tax exempt us municipal bonds with a weekly reset mode and short term bank borrowings at international subsidiaries 
if the market rates for short term borrowings increased by one percentage point around the globe  the impact would be an increase in interest expense of million with a corresponding decrease in income from continuing operations before income taxes of the same amount 
the amount was determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the company s borrowing cost  year end debt balances by category and an estimated impact on the tax exempt municipal bonds interest rates 
fluctuations in the value of the us dollar compared to foreign currencies  including the euro  also impact the company s earnings 
the greatest risk relates to products shipped between the company s european operations and the united states 
foreign currency forward contracts are used to hedge these intercompany transactions 
additionally  hedges are used to cover third party purchases of product and equipment 
as of december   there were million of hedges in place 
a uniform weakening of the us dollar against all currencies would have resulted in a charge of million related to these hedges  which would have partially offset the otherwise favorable impact of the underlying currency fluctuation 
in addition to the direct impact of the hedged amounts  changes in exchange rates also affect the volume of sales or foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive
