item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations currency exchange rate information 
due to the significant fluctuation in the value of the zar and its impact on our reported results  you may find it difficult to compare our results of operations between financial reporting periods even though we provide supplemental information about our results of operations determined on a zar basis 
this difficulty may increase as we expand our business internationally and record additional revenue and expenses in the euro and other currencies 
it may also have a negative impact on our stock price 
we generally do not engage in any currency hedging transactions intended to reduce the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on our results of operations  other than economic hedging relating to our inventory purchases which are settled in us dollars or euros 
we have used forward contracts in order to hedge our economic exposure to the zar us dollar and zar euro exchange rate fluctuations from these foreign currency transactions 
we cannot guarantee that we will enter into hedging transactions in the future or  if we do  that these transactions will successfully protect us against currency fluctuations 
south africa s high levels of poverty  unemployment and crime may increase our costs and impair our ability to maintain a qualified workforce 
while south africa has a highly developed financial and legal infrastructure  it also has high levels of crime and unemployment and there are significant differences in the level of economic and social development among its people  with large parts of the population  particularly in the rural areas  having limited access to adequate education  healthcare  housing and other basic services  including water and electricity 
in addition  south africa has a high prevalence of hiv aids and tuberculosis 
government policies aimed at alleviating and redressing the disadvantages suffered by the majority of citizens under previous governments may increase our costs and reduce our profitability  all of which could negatively affect our business 
these problems may prompt emigration of skilled workers  hinder investment into south africa and impede economic growth 
as a result  we may have difficulties attracting and retaining qualified employees 
the economy of south africa is exposed to high inflation and interest rates which could increase our operating costs and thereby reduce our profitability 
the economy of south africa in the past has been  and in the future may continue to be  characterized by rates of inflation and interest rates that are substantially higher than those prevailing in the united states and other highly developed economies 
high rates of inflation could increase our south african based costs and decrease our operating margins 
although higher interest rates would increase the amount of income we earn on our cash balances  they would also adversely affect our ability to obtain cost effective debt financing in south africa 
if we do not achieve applicable black economic empowerment objectives in our south african businesses  we risk losing our government and private contracts 
in addition  it is possible that we may be required to achieve black shareholding of our company in a manner that could dilute your ownership 
the south african government  through the broad based black economic empowerment act   established a legislative framework for the promotion of bee 
the law recognizes two distinct mechanisms for the achievement of bee objectives compliance with codes of good practice  which have already been issued  and compliance with industry specific transformation charters 
although the charter that will likely apply to our company has not yet been finalized  we believe it is likely that the charter will not differ substantially from the codes of good practice 
achievement of bee objectives is measured by a scorecard which establishes a weighting to various components of bee 
one component of bee is achieving a certain percentage of shareholdings by black south africans in south african businesses over a period of years 
this shareholding component carries the highest bee scorecard weighting 
other components include procuring goods and services from black owned businesses or from businesses that have earned good bee scores and achieving certain levels of black south african employment 
compliance with the codes and applicable charters are not enforced through civil or criminal sanction  but compliance does affect the ability of a company to secure contracts in the public and private sectors 
thus  it will be important for us to achieve applicable bee objectives 
failing to do so could jeopardize our ability to maintain existing business  including our south african pension and welfare business  or to secure future business 
we have taken a number of actions as a company to increase empowerment of black south africans 
however  it is possible that these actions may not be sufficient to enable us to achieve applicable bee objectives 
in that event  in order to avoid risking the loss of our government and private contracts  we may have to seek to comply through other means  including by selling shares of net or of our south african subsidiaries to black south africans 
such sales of shares could have a dilutive impact of your ownership interest  which could cause the market price of our stock to decline 
south african exchange control regulations could hinder our ability to make foreign investments and obtain foreign denominated financing 
south africa s exchange control regulations restrict the export of capital from south africa  the republic of namibia and the kingdoms of lesotho and swaziland  known collectively as the common monetary area without the prior approval of sarb 
while the south african government has relaxed exchange controls in recent years  it is difficult to predict whether or how it will further relax or abolish exchange control measures in the foreseeable future 
although net is a us corporation and is not itself subject to south african exchange control regulations  these regulations do restrict the ability of our south african subsidiaries to raise and deploy capital outside the common monetary area  to borrow money in currencies other than the south african rand and to hold foreign currency 
exchange control restrictions may also affect the ability of these subsidiaries to pay dividends to net unless the affected subsidiary can show that any payment of such dividend will not place it in an over borrowed position 
as of june   approximately of our cash and cash equivalents were held by our south african subsidiaries 
exchange control regulations could make it difficult for our south african subsidiaries to i export capital from south africa  ii hold foreign currency or incur indebtedness denominated in foreign currencies without the approval of sarb  iii acquire an interest in a foreign venture without the approval of sarb and first having complied with the investment criteria of sarb  iv repatriate to south africa profits of foreign operations  and v limit our business to utilize profits of one foreign business to finance operations of a different foreign business 
under current exchange control regulations  sarb approval would be required for any acquisition of our company which would involve payment to our south african shareholders of any consideration other than south african rand 
this restriction could limit our management in its ability to consider strategic options and thus  our shareholders may not be able to realize the premium over the current trading price of our shares 
most of south africa s major industries are unionized  and the majority of employees belong to trade unions 
we face the risk of disruption from labor disputes and new south african labor laws 
in the past  trade unions have had a significant impact on the collective bargaining process as well as on social and political reform in south africa in general 
although only approximately percent of our workforce is unionized and we have not experienced any labor disruptions in recent years  such labor disruptions may occur in the future 
in addition  developments in south african labor laws may increase our costs or alter our relationship with our employees and trade unions  which may have an adverse effect on us  our financial condition and our operations 
operating in south africa and other emerging markets subjects us to greater risks than those we would face if we operated in more developed markets 
emerging markets such as south africa  as well as some of the other markets into which we have recently begun to expand  including african countries outside south africa  south america  southeast asia and central and eastern europe  are subject to greater risks than more developed markets 
while we focus our business primarily on emerging markets because that is where we perceive there to be the greatest opportunities to market our products and services successfully  the political  economic and market conditions in many of these markets present risks that could make it more difficult to operate our business successfully 
some of these risks include political and economic instability  including higher rates of inflation and currency fluctuations  high levels of corruption  including bribery of public officials  loss due to civil strife  acts of war or terrorism  guerrilla activities and insurrection  a lack of well developed legal systems which could make it difficult for us to enforce our intellectual property and contractual rights  logistical and communications challenges  potential adverse changes in laws and regulatory practices  including import and export license requirements and restrictions  tariffs  legal structures and tax laws  difficulties in staffing and managing operations and ensuring the safety of our employees  restrictions on the right to convert or repatriate currency or export assets  greater risk of uncollectible accounts and longer collection cycles  indigenization and empowerment programs  and exposure to liability under us securities and foreign trade laws  including the foreign corrupt practices act  or fcpa  and regulations established by the us department of treasury s office of foreign assets control  or ofac 
many of these countries and regions are in various stages of developing institutions and political  legal and regulatory systems that are characteristic of democracies 
however  institutions in these countries and regions may not yet be as firmly established as they are in democracies in the developed world 
many of these countries and regions are also in the process of transitioning to a market economy and  as a result  are experiencing changes in their economies and their government policies that can affect our investments in these countries and regions 
moreover  the procedural safeguards of the new legal and regulatory regimes in these countries and regions are still being developed and  therefore  existing laws and regulations may be applied inconsistently 
in some circumstances  it may not be possible to obtain the legal remedies provided under those laws and regulations in a timely manner 
as the political  economic and legal environments remain subject to continuous development  investors in these countries and regions face uncertainty as to the security of their investments 
any unexpected changes in the political or economic conditions in these or neighboring countries or others in the region may have a material adverse effect on the international investments that we have made or may make in the future  which may in turn have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  cash flows and financial condition 
risks relating to government regulation we are required to comply with certain us laws and regulations  including the foreign corrupt practices act as well as economic and trade sanctions  which could adversely impact our future growth 
we must comply with the fcpa  which prohibits us companies or their agents and employees from providing anything of value to a foreign official for the purposes of influencing any act or decision of these individuals in their official capacity to help obtain or retain business  direct business to any person or corporate entity or obtain any unfair advantage 
in addition  ofac administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions against targeted foreign countries  entities and individuals based on us foreign policy and national security goals 
any failure by us to adopt appropriate compliance procedures and ensure that our employees  agents and business partners comply with the fcpa could subject us to substantial penalties 
in addition  the requirement that we comply with the fcpa could put us at a competitive disadvantage with companies that are not required to comply with the fcpa or could otherwise harm our business 
for example  in many emerging markets  there may be significant levels of official corruption  and thus  bribery of public officials may be a commonly accepted cost of doing business 
our refusal to engage in illegal behavior  such as paying bribes  may result in us not being able to obtain business that we might otherwise have been able to secure or possibly even result in unlawful  selective or arbitrary action being taken against us by foreign officials 
furthermore  the trade sanctions administered and enforced by ofac target countries which are typically less developed countries 
since less developed countries present some of the best opportunities for us to expand our business internationally  restrictions against entering into transactions with those foreign countries  as well as with certain entities and individuals in those countries  can adversely affect our ability to grow our business 
changes in current south african government regulations relating to social welfare grants could adversely affect our revenues and cash flows 
we derive a substantial portion of our current business from the distribution of social welfare grants onto smart cards in south africa and the transaction fees resulting from use of these smart cards 
because social welfare eligibility and grant amounts are regulated by the south african government  any changes to or reinterpretations of the government regulations relating to social welfare may result in the non renewal or reduction of grants for certain individuals  or a determination that currently eligible social welfare grant recipients are no longer eligible 
if any of these changes were to occur  the number of smart cards in use could decrease  the amount of money on any particular smart card could decrease or the amount of transactions effected on any particular smart card may decrease  all of which could result in a reduction of our revenues and cash flows 
we do not have a south african banking license and therefore we provide our wage payment solution through an arrangement with a third party bank  which limits our control over this business and the economic benefit we derive from it 
if this arrangement were to terminate  we would not be able to operate our wage payment business without alternate means of access to a banking license the south african retail banking market is highly regulated  but the south african government has identified the need to service the unbanked market through the liberalization of the regulatory environment in order for retailers and non banking service providers to innovate products and delivery channels for the unbanked market 
however  under current law and regulations  a portion of our south african wage payment business activities in the unbanked market requires us to be registered as a bank in south africa or to have access to an existing banking license 
we are not currently so registered  but we have entered into an agreement with grindrod bank limited that enables us to implement our wage payment solution in compliance with the relevant laws and regulations 
if the agreement were to be terminated  we would not be able to operate our wage payment business unless we were able to obtain access to a banking license through alternate means 
in addition  the south african financial advisory and intermediary services act   requires persons who give advice regarding the purchase of financial products or who act as intermediaries between financial product suppliers and consumers in south africa to register as financial service providers 
we have applied for a license under this act in order to continue to provide advice and intermediary services in respect of the financial products on which we advise and the payment processing services we provide in south africa on behalf of insurers and other financial product suppliers 
if we fail to obtain this license  we may be stopped from continuing this part of our business in south africa 
our payment processing businesses are subject to substantial governmental regulation and may be adversely affected by liability under  or any future inability to comply with  existing or future regulations or requirements 
our payment processing activities are subject to extensive regulation 
compliance with the requirements under these various regulatory regimes may cause us to incur significant additional costs and failure to comply with such requirements could result in the shutdown of the non complying facility  the imposition of liens  fines and or civil or criminal liability 
we may be subject to regulations regarding privacy  data use and or security which could adversely affect our business 
we are subject to regulations in a number of the countries in which we operate relating to the collection  use  retention  security and transfer of personally identifiable information about the people who use our products and services  in particular  personal financial and health information 
new laws in this area have been passed by several jurisdictions  and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions 
the interpretation and application of user data protection laws are in a state of flux 
these laws may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and our current data protection policies and practices may not be consistent with those interpretations and applications 
complying with these varying requirements could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business 
any failure  or perceived failure  by us to comply with any regulatory requirements or international privacy or consumer protection related laws and regulations could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others  subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity and adversely affect us 
in addition  as noted above  we are subject to the possibility of security breaches  which themselves may result in a violation of these laws 
risks relating to our common stock our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile 
our stock price has experienced recent significant volatility 
during the fiscal year  our stock price ranged from a low of to a high of 
we expect that the trading price of our common stock may continue to be volatile as a result of a number of factors  including  but not limited to the following developments or the absence of developments in obtaining a contract from sassa  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  particularly the us dollar zar exchange rate  quarterly variations in our operating results  especially if our operating results fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors  announcements of acquisitions  disposals or impairments of intangible assets  the timing of or delays in the commencement  implementation or completion of major projects  large purchases or sales of our common stock  general conditions in the markets in which we operate  and economic and financial conditions 
approximately of our outstanding common stock is owned by two shareholders 
the interests of these shareholders may conflict with those of our other shareholders 
there is a concentration of ownership of our outstanding common stock because approximately of our outstanding common stock is owned by two shareholders 
based on its most recent sec filing disclosing its ownership of our shares  international value advisers  llc  or iva  beneficially owned of our outstanding common stock 
in addition  investment entities affiliated with general atlantic llc owned of our outstanding common stock 
general atlantic also has representation on our board of directors 
the interests of iva and general atlantic may be different from or conflict with the interests of our other shareholders 
as a result of the ownership by iva and general atlantic  as well as general atlantic s board seat  they will be able  if they act together  to influence our management and affairs and all matters requiring shareholder approval  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company  thus depriving shareholders of a premium for their shares  or facilitating a change of control that other shareholders may oppose 
we may seek to raise additional financing by issuing new securities with terms or rights superior to those of our shares of common stock  which could adversely affect the market price of our shares of common stock 
we may require additional financing to fund future operations  including expansion in current and new markets  programming development and acquisition  capital costs and the costs of any necessary implementation of technological innovations or alternative technologies  or to fund acquisitions 
because of the exposure to market risks associated with economies in emerging markets  we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  the percentage ownership of our current shareholders will be reduced  and the holders of the new equity securities may have rights superior to those of the holders of shares of common stock  which could adversely affect the market price and voting power of shares of common stock 
if we raise additional funds by issuing debt securities  the holders of these debt securities would similarly have some rights senior to those of the holders of shares of common stock  and the terms of these debt securities could impose restrictions on operations and create a significant interest expense for us 
we may have difficulty raising necessary capital to fund operations or acquisitions as a result of market price volatility for our shares of common stock 
in recent years  the securities markets in the united states have experienced a high level of price and volume volatility  and the market price of securities of many companies have experienced wide fluctuations that have not necessarily been related to the operations  performance  underlying asset values or prospects of such companies 
for these reasons  our shares of common stock can also be expected to be subject to volatility resulting from purely market forces over which we will have no control 
if our business development plans are successful  we may require additional financing to continue to develop and exploit existing and new technologies  to expand into new markets and to make acquisitions  all of which may be dependent upon our ability to obtain financing through debt and equity or other means 
issuances of significant amounts of stock in the future could potentially dilute your equity ownership and adversely affect the price of our common stock 
we believe that it is necessary to maintain a sufficient number of available authorized shares of our common stock in order to provide us with the flexibility to issue shares for business purposes that may arise from time to time 
for example  we could sell additional shares to raise capital to fund our operations or to acquire other businesses  issue additional shares under our stock incentive plan or declare a stock dividend 
our board may authorize the issuance of additional shares of common stock without notice to  or further action by  our shareholders  unless shareholder approval is required by law or the rules of the nasdaq stock market 
the issuance of additional shares could dilute the equity ownership of our current shareholders 
in addition  additional shares that we issue would likely be freely tradable which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act  especially over companies that we may acquire  could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price 
our management evaluation and auditor attestation regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of june   excluded the operations of ksnet 
if we are not able to integrate ksnet s operations into our internal control over financial reporting  our internal control over financial reporting may not be effective 
under section of the sarbanes oxley act of  or sarbanes  we are required to furnish a management certification and auditor attestation regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
we are required to report  among other things  control deficiencies that constitute a material weakness or changes in internal control that materially affect  or are reasonably likely to materially affect  internal control over financial reporting 
a material weakness is a deficiency  or a combination of deficiencies  in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 
the requirement to evaluate and report on our internal controls also applies to companies that we acquire 
as a private company  ksnet was not required to comply with sarbanes prior to the time we acquired it 
the integration of ksnet into our internal control over financial reporting has required significant time and resources from our management and other personnel and may increase our compliance costs 
our management evaluation and auditor attestation regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of june   excluded the operations of ksnet 
if we fail to successfully integrate these operations into our internal control over financial reporting  our internal control over financial reporting may not be effective 
while we continue to dedicate resources and management time to ensuring that we have effective controls over financial reporting  including with respect to ksnet s operations  failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on the market s perception of our business and our stock price 
you may experience difficulties in effecting service of legal process  enforcing foreign judgments or bringing original actions based upon us laws  including the federal securities laws or other foreign laws  against us or our directors and officers and experts 
while net is incorporated in the state of florida  united states  the company is headquartered in johannesburg  south africa and substantially all of the company s assets are located outside the united states 
in addition  the majority of net s directors and officers reside outside of the united states and our experts  including our independent registered public accountants  are based in south africa 
as a result  even though you could effect service of legal process upon net  as a florida corporation  in the united states  you may not be able to collect any judgment obtained against net in the united states  including any judgment based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal securities laws  because substantially all of our assets are located outside the united states 
moreover  it may not be possible for you to effect service of legal process upon the majority of our directors and officers or upon our experts within the united states or elsewhere outside south africa and any judgment obtained against any of our foreign directors  officers and experts in the united states  including one based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal securities laws  may not be collectible in the united states and may not be enforced by a south african court 
a foreign judgment is not directly enforceable in south africa  but constitutes a cause of action which will be enforced by south african courts provided that the court or arbitral body which pronounced the judgment had international jurisdiction and competence to entertain the case according to the principles recognized by south african law with reference to the jurisdiction of foreign courts  the judgment is final and conclusive that is  it cannot be altered by the court which pronounced it  the judgment has not lapsed  the recognition and enforcement of the judgment by south african courts would not be contrary to public policy in south africa  including observance of the rules of natural justice which require that no award is enforceable unless the defendant was duly served with documents initiating proceedings  that he was given a fair opportunity to be heard and that he enjoyed the right to be legally represented in a free and fair trial before an impartial tribunal  the judgment was not obtained by improper or fraudulent means  the judgment does not involve the enforcement of a penal or foreign revenue law or any award of multiple or punitive damages  and the enforcement of the judgment is not otherwise precluded by the provisions of the protection of business act of as amended  of the republic of south africa 
it has been the policy of south african courts to award compensation for the loss or damage actually sustained by the person to whom the compensation is awarded 
south african courts have awarded compensation to shareholders who have suffered damages as a result of a diminution in the value of their shares based on various actions by the corporation and its management 
although the award of punitive damages is generally unknown to the south african legal system  that does not mean that such awards are necessarily contrary to public policy 
whether a judgment was contrary to public policy depends on the facts of each case 
exorbitant  unconscionable  or excessive awards will generally be contrary to public policy 
south african courts cannot enter into the merits of a foreign judgment and cannot act as a court of appeal or review over the foreign court 
further  if a foreign judgment is enforced by a south african court  it will be payable in south african currency 
also  under south africa s exchange control laws  the approval of sarb is required before a defendant resident in south africa may pay money to a nonresident plaintiff in satisfaction of a foreign judgment enforced by a court in south africa 
it is doubtful whether an original action based on united states federal securities laws may be brought before south african courts 
a plaintiff who is not resident in south africa may be required to provide security for costs in the event of proceedings being initiated in south africa 
furthermore  the rules of the high court of south africa require that documents executed outside south africa must be authenticated for the purpose of use in south african courts 
in reaching the foregoing conclusions  we consulted with our south african legal counsel  cliffe dekker hofmeyr inc we may become subject to a us tax liability for failing to withhold on certain distributions on instruments issued in connection with the aplitec transaction 
there is no statutory  judicial or administrative authority that directly addresses the tax treatment of non us holders that elected to receive units in a trust representing beneficial interests in one of our subsidiaries in connection with our acquisition of aplitec 
we believe these interests should be treated for united states federal income tax purposes as  and we did treat them as  separate and distinct interests in the subsidiary 
as such  we and our affiliates did not withhold any amounts for us federal taxes in respect of any distributions paid on such interests 
there is a risk  however  that these interests  together with the special convertible preferred stock  may be treated as representing a single direct equity interest in us for us federal income tax purposes 
in such case  distributions received with respect to the interests in the subsidiary could be subject to us federal withholding tax  and we could be liable for failure to withhold such taxes in our capacity as withholding agent 
in addition  our failure to collect and remit us federal withholding tax may also subject us to penalties

item legal proceedings in  we instituted a lawsuit against sassa in the high court  alleging that it unlawfully moved beneficiaries to sapo in violation of our contract and the pfma  seeking injunctive relief 
in january  the high court ruled in our favor and directed sassa to discontinue the registration of any beneficiaries with sapo until a proper procurement process had been completed 
sassa appealed the high court s ruling to the south african supreme court of appeal  which overturned the high court s judgment in march we applied for leave to appeal to the south african constitutional court  which was denied in june see also a 
risk factors we were unsuccessful in our lawsuit against sassa challenging sassa s right to contract with sapo to provide banking or payment services relating to social grant beneficiaries 
if sassa provides this business to sapo rather than to us  the revenue and operating income we derive from our current sassa contract could be substantially reduced  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
we also made application to the high court for the review and setting aside of the decision to withdraw the previous sassa tender and we are currently responding to sassa s answering affidavit  where after the parties will apply for a hearing date
