item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and notes thereto 
the company s subsidiaries are listed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
overview the company presently owns producing and non producing properties located primarily in texas  oklahoma  west virginia  the gulf of mexico  new mexico  colorado and louisiana  and owns a substantial amount of well servicing equipment 
all of the company s oil and gas properties and interests are located in the united states 
assets in our principal focus areas include mature properties with long lived reserves and significant development opportunities as well as newer properties with development and exploration potential 
we believe our balanced portfolio of assets and our ongoing hedging program position us well for both the current commodity price environment and future potential upside as we develop our attractive resource opportunities 
our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from our operations and our credit facility 
the company attempts to assume the position of operator in all acquisitions of producing properties 
the company will continue to evaluate prospects for leasehold acquisitions and for exploration and development operations in areas in which it owns interests and is actively pursuing the acquisition of producing properties 
in order to diversify and broaden its asset base  the company will consider acquiring the assets or stock in other entities and companies in the oil and gas business 
the main objective of the company in making any such acquisitions will be to acquire income producing assets so as to increase the company s net worth and increase the company s oil and gas reserve base 
our cash flows depend on many factors  including the price of oil and gas  the success of our acquisition and drilling activities and the operational performance of our producing properties 
we use derivative instruments to manage our commodity price risk 
this practice may prevent us from receiving the full advantage of increases in oil and gas prices above the maximum fixed amount specified in the derivative agreements and subjects us to the credit risk of the counterparties to such agreements 
since all of our derivative contracts are accounted for under mark to market accounting  we expect continued volatility in gains and losses on mark to market derivative contracts in our consolidated income statement as changes occur in the nymex price indices 
critical accounting estimates proved oil and gas reserves proved oil and gas reserves directly impact financial accounting estimates  including depreciation  depletion and amortization 
proved reserves represent estimated quantities of natural gas  crude oil  condensate  and natural gas liquids that geological and engineering data demonstrate  with reasonable certainty  to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions existing at the time the estimates were made 
the process of estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves is very complex  requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available geological  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including  but not limited to  additional development activity  evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 
consequently  material revisions upward or downward to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time 

table of contents depreciation  depletion and amortization for oil and gas properties the quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of our calculation of depletion expense and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense 
holding all other factors constant  if reserves were revised upward or downward  earnings would increase or decrease respectively 
depreciation  depletion and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties are calculated using the unit of production method 
the reserve base used to calculate depletion  depreciation or amortization is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties 
the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves for lease and well equipment costs  which include development costs and successful exploration drilling costs 
estimated future dismantlement  restoration and abandonment costs  net of salvage values  are taken into account 
liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million  compared to million in the prior year 
additionally  under a joint development agreement  million of the company s capital expenditures were carried by the joint venture partners 
excluding the effects of significant unforeseen expenses or other income  our cash flow from operations fluctuates primarily because of variations in oil and gas production and prices or changes in working capital accounts 
our oil and gas production will vary based on actual well performance but may be curtailed due to factors beyond our control 
hurricanes in the gulf of mexico may shut down our production for the duration of the storm s presence in the gulf or damage production facilities so that we cannot produce from a particular property for an extended amount of time 
in addition  downstream activities on major pipelines in the gulf of mexico can also cause us to shut in production for various lengths of time 
our realized oil and gas prices vary due to world political events  supply and demand of products  product storage levels  and weather patterns 
we sell the vast majority of our production at spot market prices 
accordingly  product price volatility will affect our cash flow from operations 
to mitigate price volatility we sometimes lock in prices for some portion of our production through the use of financial instruments 
if our exploratory drilling results in significant new discoveries  we will have to expend additional capital in order to finance the completion  development  and potential additional opportunities generated by our success 
we believe that  because of the additional reserves resulting from the successful wells and our record of reserve growth in recent years  we will be able to access sufficient additional capital through additional bank financing 
the company has in place both a stock repurchase program and a limited partnership interest repurchase program 
spending under these programs in was million 
the company expects continue spending under these programs in as of march   the company maintains a credit facility totaling million  with a borrowing base of million 
the bank reviews the borrowing base semi annually and  at their discretion  may decrease or propose an increase to the borrowing base relative to a redetermined estimate of proved oil and gas reserves 
our oil and gas properties are pledged as collateral for the line of credit and we are subject to certain financial covenants defined in the agreement 
if we do not comply with these covenants on a continuing basis  the lenders have the right to refuse to advance additional funds under the facility and or declare all principal and interest immediately due and payable 
during the second quarter of  the company s offshore subsidiary arranged a subordinated credit facility with a private lender controlled by a director of the company 
the facility provides availability of million and is secured by properties released by the bank and pledged under this agreement 
as of march   the advances under this credit facility are million due november 
table of contents it is the goal of the company to increase its oil and gas reserves and production through the acquisition and development of oil and gas properties 
the company also continues to explore and consider opportunities to further expand its oilfield servicing revenues through additional investment in field service equipment 
however  the majority of the company s capital spending is discretionary  and the ultimate level of expenditures will be dependent on the company s assessment of the oil and gas business environment  the number and quality of oil and gas prospects available  the market for oilfield services  and oil and gas business opportunities in general 
results of operations as compared to the company had net income of  in as compared to a net loss of  in the significant components of net income are discussed below 
oil and gas sales were  in as compared to  in a chart summarizing oil and gas production and revenue is presented below 
increase decrease barrels of oil produced average price received rounded  including the impact of derivatives oil revenue mcf of gas produced average price received rounded  including the impact of derivatives gas revenue total oil gas revenue oil gas prices received excluding the impact of derivatives were increase decrease oil price gas price the decrease in oil production reflects the natural decline of existing properties offset by properties added during from our west texas drilling program 
the decrease in gas production is primarily due to the natural decline of the offshore properties 
lease operating expense for increased by  or compared to the offshore properties natural decline in gas production resulted in decreased costs  primarily in the area of marketing and transportation and workover expense 
the decrease in lease operating expense on our offshore properties was offset by across the board increases on our onshore properties 
the onshore properties increase was primarily due to increased production taxes related to higher commodity prices coupled with costs from the additional wells drilled in our west texas region 
general and administrative expense increased  in or as compared to primarily due to increased personnel costs 
the largest component of these personnel costs was salaries  however  engineering consultants  rent and employee related taxes and insurance also contributed to the increase 

table of contents field service income for increased to  in as compared to  in the most significant factor contributing to this increase was additional gas transportation revenue of approximately million from our offshore properties recorded during the fourth quarter of in it was determined that we could recover a portion of the cost of our pipelines and we filed for and received payment on current as well as past recoveries 
there are no expenses associated with this increase in gas transportation revenue 
water transport income contributed approximately thousand towards the increase as a result of adding additional transport trucks and placing a new salt water disposal well into service in our south texas area 
service rig income was the final contributor with a net increase of approximately thousand 
service rig income in our west texas area increased but was offset by a decrease in our south texas area primarily as a result of the transfer of a rig from south texas to west texas 
depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion on discounted liabilities expense decreased to  in from  in or 
this decrease is primarily related to the decrease in offshore production during interest expense decreased to  in from  in this decrease is due to lower outstanding debt balances during the year offset by slightly higher average interest rates 
the average interest rates paid on outstanding bank borrowings subject to interest during and were and respectively 
as of december  and  the total outstanding borrowings were  and  respectively 
a provision for income taxes of  was recorded for while a benefit from income taxes of  was recorded for the provision for income taxes varies from the federal statutory tax rate primarily due to percentage depletion 
the company is entitled to percentage depletion on certain of its wells  which is calculated without reference to the basis of the property 
to the extent that such depletion exceeds a property s basis it creates a permanent difference  which lowers the company s effective rate
