direct revenue also decreased due to inventory reduction initiatives in the first half of  which affected inventory levels resulting in fill rates being lower comparing the respective periods  and due to a decrease in the sales of ammunition and reloading supplies as supply has caught up to demand and consumers are now able to find ammunition at retail stores

we added new credit cardholders as the number of average active accounts increased to million compared to on a managed basis  financial services revenue increased million  or  in compared to primarily due to lower loan losses  increases in interchange income  a decrease in interest expense  and growth in the number of active accounts and average balance per account  partially offset by higher customer reward costs 
in  wfb completed two securitization transactions for a total of million and renewed its million and million variable funding facilities 
curren t business environment worldwide credit markets and macroeconomic environment during  the economic environment has shown signs of improvement  which we believe has led to a lower level of delinquencies and to a decrease in charge offs in compared to we expect our charge off and delinquency levels to remain below industry standards 
our financial services business continues to monitor developments in the securitization and certificates of deposit markets to ensure adequate access to liquidity 
developments in legislation and regulation on march   wfb received a preliminary report related to a compliance examination conducted in the second quarter of from the fdic 
wfb received the final version of this report from the fdic on may  the fdic findings were that certain wfb practices regarding the assessment of overlimit fees  late fees  and penalty interest charges and contacting delinquent cardholders at their place of employment were improper because such practices were unfair and or deceptive under applicable law 
the fdic has indicated that it intends to require wfb to reimburse cardholders who paid improper fees and or interest charges and has also indicated that it will seek to impose on wfb a monetary penalty as a result of the improper practices 
subsequent to january   wfb and the fdic agreed in principle to settle all matters related to the compliance examination 
as of january   we had accrued a liability of million recorded as a charge to selling  distribution  and administrative expense in our consolidated financial statements for the matters cited by the fdic in its examination report 
the practices cited by the fdic in its examination report as improper were eliminated in and will not be reimposed 
wfb remained well capitalized following the accrual of costs to resolve these matters with the fdic 
the costs incurred by wfb in resolving the matters cited by the fdic were reflected in a reduced marketing fee paid by the financial services segment to the direct and retail segments according to contractual arrange ment 
in may  the card act was signed into law 
some provisions were effective in august  but many of the provisions became effective in february and august the card act has and will continue to affect various credit card practices of card issuers  including our financial services business  such as marketing  underwriting  pricing  billing  and disclosure 
for example  the card act and related regulations restrict our ability to increase interest rates on existing credit card balances  charge over limit fees  and charge fees for making a payment 
the card act provisions also further define acceptable due dates  payment allocations  disclosure requirements  and reasonable fees  and prohibit incr easing the interest rates on variable rate credit card accounts that are subject to a fixed rate floor 
as a result of the card act  revenue from our financial services business was negatively impacted 
beginning in february  the third phase of the card act requires creditors that increased annual percentage rates due to credit criteria  market conditions  or other factors on or after january   to review accounts at least every six months to determine whether the annual percentage rate should be reduced  which could result in reduced interest income 
the card act also requires the federal reserve to conduct various studies regarding interchange fees  credit limit reductions  financial literacy  marketing  and credit card terms and conditions 
future legislation or regulations may be issued as a result of these studies 
the full impact of the remaining card act requirements on wfb is unknown at this time due to the uncertainty of the results of these studies 
on july   the reform act was signed into law 
the reform act makes extensive changes to the laws regulating financial services firms and credit rating agencies and requires significant rule making 
in addition  the legislation mandates multiple studies which could result in additional legislative or regulatory action 
wfb is currently reviewing the impact the reform act will have on its business 
the reform act imposes a moratorium on the approval of applications for fdic insurance for an industrial bank  credit card bank  or trust bank that is owned by a commercial firm 
furthermore  the fdic must  under most circumstances  disapprove any change in control that would result in direct or indirect control by a commercial firm of a credit card bank  such as wfb 
for purposes of this provision  a company is a commercial firm if its consolidated annual gross revenues from activities that are financial in nature and  if applicable  from the ownership or control of one or more insured depository institutions  in the aggregate  represent less than of its consolidated annual gross revenues 
the reform act does not  however  elimina te the exception from the definition of bank under the bhca for credit card banks  such as wfb 
in addition  the reform act directs the comptroller general of the united states to complete a study within months of the reform act enactment to determine whether it is necessary  in order to strengthen the safety and soundness of institutions or the stability of the financial system  to eliminate certain exceptions under the bhca  including the exception for credit card banks 
if the credit card bank exception were eliminated or modified  we may be required to divest our ownership of wfb unless we were willing and able to become a bank holding company under the bhca 
any such forced divestiture would materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 
the reform act established the new independent bureau which will have broad rulemaking  supervisory  and enforcement authority over consumer products  including credit cards 
the bureau will be directed to prevent unfair  deceptive  or abusive practices and ensure that all consumers have access to markets for consumer financial products and services  and that such markets are fair  transparent  and competitive 
states are permitted to adopt stricter consumer protection laws and state officials can enforce consumer protection rules issued by the bureau 
the reform act will also affect a number of significant changes relating to asset backed securities  including additional oversight and regulation of credit rating agencies and additional reporting and disclosure requirements 
among other things  the reform act requires the federal banking agencies and the sec to prescribe regulations to require securitizers to retain an economic interest in securitized assets  generally at a level of not less than five percent 
the reform act also requires the sec to adopt regulations regarding the use of representations and warranties in the market for asset backed securities 
in addition  the reform act will prohibit issuers and payment card networks from placing restrictions on vendors relating to credit card transactions  which could affect consumer behavior and the use of credit cards as a form of payment 
the changes resulting from the reform act may impact our profitability  require changes to certain of wfb business practices  impose upon wfb more stringent capital  liquidity  and leverage ratio requirements  increase fdic deposit insurance premiums  or otherwise adversely affect wfb busines s 
these changes may also require wfb to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make necessary changes 
as a result of the recent accounting guidance on consolidations and the accounting for transfers of financial assets and the criteria for determining whether to consolidate a variable interest entity  there was uncertainty over fdic guidance regarding the safe harbor for legal isolation of transferred assets provided by fdic rule cfr treatment by the federal deposit insurance corporation as conservator or receiver of financial assets transferred by an insured depository institution in connection with a securitization or participation 
in march  the fdic announced an interim amendment of this regulation 
under the interim amendment  the legal isolation of property transferred in a securitization transaction prior to september   was preserved  regardless of whether the transfer qualified for sale accounting treatment under new accounting standards if the transfer otherwise complied with the fdic regulation 
on september   the fdic approved a final rule that  subject to certain conditions  preserves the safe harbor treatment applicable to certain grandfathered revolving trusts and master trusts that had issued at least one series of asset backed securities as of such date  which we believe includes the trust 
the final rule imposes significant new conditions on the availability of the safe harbor with respect to securitizations that are not grandfathered 
several rules and regulations have recently been proposed or adopted that may substantially affect issuers of asset backed securities 
on april   the sec issued proposed rules that will significantly change the offering process  disclosure  and reporting for asset backed securities 
pursuant to the provisions of the reform act  on january   the sec adopted rules that require issuers of asset backed securities to disclose demand  repurchase  and replacement information through the perio dic filing of a new form with the sec 
these rules also require rating agencies to disclose in any report accompanying a credit rating for an asset backed security the representations  warranties  and enforcement mechanisms available to investors and how they differ from those in similar securities 
also pursuant to the provisions of the reform act  on january   the sec issued rules that require issuers of registered asset backed securities to perform a review of the assets underlying the securities and to publicly disclose information relating to the review 
these rules also require issuers of asset backed securities to make publicly available the findings and conclusions of any third party due diligence report obtained by the issuer 
it remains to be seen whether and to what extent the january   rules or any other final rules adopted by the sec will impact wfb and its ability and willingness to continue to rely on the securitization market for funding 
impact of new accounting pronouncements the accounting guidance on consolidations and accounting for transfers of financial assets and the criteria for determining whether to consolidate a variable interest entity resulted in the consolidation of the trust effective january  consequently  there was a material impact on our total assets  total liabilities  retained earnings and other comprehensive i ncome  statement of cash flows  and the components of our financial services revenue 
the consolidation of the trust eliminated retained interests in securitized loans and required the establishment of an allowance for loan losses on the securitized credit card loans 
the credit card loans of the trust are recorded as restricted credit card loans and the liabilities of the trust are recorded as secured borrowings 
the secured borrowings still contain the legal isolation requirements which would protect the assets pledged as collateral for the securitization investors as well as protecting cabela and wfb from any liability from default on the notes 
the trust was consolidated on january   resulting in an increase in total assets and liabilities of billion and billion  respectively  and retained earnings and other comprehensive income decreasing million  after tax 
in  we began reporting the results of operations of our financial services business in a manner similar to our historical managed presentation for financial performance of the total managed portfolio of credit card loans  excluding income derived from the changes in the valuation of our interest only strip  cash reserve accounts  and cash accounts associated with the securitized loans 
at the beginning of  wfb required capital was increased under regulatory capital requirements of the applicable federal agencies as a result of new accounting standards which required the consolidation of the assets and liabilities of the trust on wfb balance sheet 
as of december   the most recent notification from the fdic categorized wfb as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
in order for wfb to continue to meet the minimum requirements for the well capitalized classification under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  we invested million in in additional capital in wfb 
effective december   we amended the terms of our credit agreement to allow us to invest up to million into wfb in plus up to million per year through june   when this credit agreement expires

our aging method is based on the number of completed billing cycles during which a customer has failed to make a required payment 
as part of collection efforts  a credit card loan may be closed and placed on non accrual or restructured in a fixed payment plan prior to charge off 
our fixed payment plans consist of a lower interest rate  reduced minimum payment  and elimination of fees 
loans on fixed payment plans include loans in which the customer has engaged a consumer credit counseling agency to assist them in managing their debt 
non accrual loans with two consecutive missed payments will resume accruing interest at the rate they had accrued at before they were placed on non accrual 
payments received on non accrual loans will be applied to principal and reduce the amount of the loan 
the following chart shows delinquent  non accrual  and restructured loans as a percentage of our managed credit card loans  including any accrued interest and fees  at the years ended number of days delinquent and still accruing greater than days greater than days greater than days non accrual restructured excluded from percentages above the following chart reports delinquencies as a percentage of our managed credit card loans  including any delinquent non accrual and restructured credit card loans  that is consistent with our monthly external reporting for the years ended number of days delinquent greater than days greater than days greater than days we have devoted significant attention to processes which will mitigate our charge offs 
these processes include changes in our collection strategies and practices that proactively promote fixed payment and non accrual plans to certain cardholders as necessary 
allowance for loan losses and charge offs the allowance for loan losses represents management estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio segment 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a charge to the provision for loan losses and is regularly evaluated by management for adequacy 
management estimates losses inherent in the credit card loans and restructured credit card loans based on a model which tracks historical loss experience on delinquent accounts and charge offs  net of estimated recoveries 
wfb uses a migration analysis that estimates the likelihood that a credit card loan will progress through the various stages of delinquency and to charge off 
the migration analysis estimates the gross amount of principal that will be charged off over of the next twelve months  net of recoveries 
this estimate is used to derive an estimated allowance 
in addition to these methods of measurement  management also considers other factors such as general economic and business conditions affecting key lending areas  credit concentration  changes in origination and portfolio management  and credit quality trends 
since the evaluation of the inherent loss with respect to these factors is subject to a high degree of uncertainty  the measurement of the overall allowance is subject to estimation risk  and the amount of actual losses can vary significantly from the estimated amounts 
charge offs consist of the uncollectible principal  interest  and fees on a customer account 
recoveries are the amounts collected on previously charged off accounts 
most bankcard issuers charge off accounts at days 
we charge off credit card loans on a daily basis after an account becomes at a minimum days contractual ly delinquent to allow us to manage the collection process more efficiently 
accounts relating to cardholder bankruptcies  cardholder deaths  and fraudulent transactions are charged off earlier 
wfb records charged off cardholder fees and accrued interest receivable directly against interest and fee income included in financial services revenue 
the following chart shows the activity in our allowance for loan losses and charge off activity for the years ended dollars in thousands balance  beginning of period change in allowance for loan losses upon consolidation of the trust provision for loan losses charge offs recoveries net charge offs balance  end of period net charge offs on securitized credit card loans net charge offs on credit card loans charge offs of accrued interest and fees recorded as a reduction in interest and fee income total net charge offs including accrued interest and fees net charge offs including accrued interest and fees as a percentage of average managed credit card loans for  net charge offs as a percentage of average managed credit card loans decreased to  down basis points compared to for we believe our charge off levels remain well below industry averages 
our net charge off rates and allowance for loan losses have decreased due to improved outlooks in the quality of our credit card portfolio evidenced by lower delinquencies and delinquency roll rates and favorable charge off trends 
aging of credit cards loans outstanding the quality of our managed credit card loan portfolio at any time reflects  among other factors the creditworthiness of cardholders  general economic conditions  the success of our account management and collection activities  and the life cycle stage of the portfolio 
during periods of economic weakness  delinquencies and n et charge offs are more likely to increase 
we have mitigated periods of economic weakness by selecting a customer base that is very creditworthy

in  our financial services business completed two securitization transactions totaling million and renewed two variable funding facilities totaling million 
we will continue to evaluate additional funding sources to determine the most cost effective source of funds for our financial services business segment 
these potential sources include  among others  certificates of deposit and securitizations 
our retail and direct business segments and our financial services business segment have significantly differing liquidity and capital needs 
the primary cash requirements of our merchandising business relate to capital for new retail stores  purchases of inventory  investments in our management in formation systems and infrastructure  purchases of economic development bonds related to the construction of new retail stores  and general working capital needs 
we historically have met these requirements with cash generated from our merchandising business operations  borrowing under revolving credit facilities  issuing debt and equity securities  obtaining economic development grants from state and local governments when developing new retail stores  collecting principal and interest payments on our economic development bonds  and from the retirement of economic development bonds 
retail and direct business segments the cash flow we generate from our merc handising business is seasonal  with our peak cash requirements for inventory occurring from april through november 
while we have consistently generated overall positive annual cash flow from our operating activities  other sources of liquidity are required by our merchandising business during these peak cash use periods 
these sources historically have included short term borrowings under our revolving credit facility and access to debt markets 
while we generally have been able to manage our cash needs during peak periods  if any disruption occurred to our funding sources  or if we underestimated our cash needs  we would be unable to purchase inventory and otherwise conduct our merchandising business to its maximum effectiveness  which could result in reduced revenue and profits 
our million unsecured revolving credit facility and unsecured senior notes contain certain financial covenants  including the maintenance of minimum debt coverage  a fixed charge coverage ratio  a cash flow leverage ratio  and a minimum tangible net worth standard 
in the event that we failed to comply with these covenants and the failure to comply would go beyond days  a default would trigger and all principal and outstanding interest would immediately be due and payable 
at january   we were in compliance with all financial covenants under our credit agreements and unsecured notes 
we anticipate that we will continue to be in compliance with all financial covenants under our credit agreements and unsecured notes through the next months 
although our million unsecured revolving credit facility does not expire until june  volatility and tightening in the credit markets could jeopardize the counterparty obligations of one or more of the banks participating in our facility  which could have an adverse effect on our business if we are not able to replace such credit facility or find other sources of liquidity on acceptable terms 
we currently expect all participating banks to provide funding as needed pu rsuant to the terms of our credit facility 
effective june   we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement for our operations in canada extending our million canadian dollars cad unsecured revolving credit facility through june  the credit facility permits the issuance of up to million cad in letters of credit  which reduce the overall credit limit available under the credit facility 
interest remains variable  is computed at rates which are defined in the agreement plus a margin  and is payable monthly 
all other terms of the credit agreement remained unchanged 
financial services business segment the primary cash requirements of wfb relate to the financing of credit card loans 
these cash requirements will increase if our credit card originations increase or if our cardholders balances or spending increase 
wfb sources operating funds in the ordinary course of business through various financing activities  which include funding obtained from securitization transactions  borrowing under its federal funds purchase agreements  obtaining brokered and non brokered certificates of deposit  and generating cash from operations 
wfb completed term securitization transactions for million in april and million in february under the term asset backed securities loan facilities talf program 
the most senior class of asset backed notes issued in the transactions qualified as eligible collateral under the talf program provided by the federal reserve bank of new york frbny 
under the talf program  the frbny provided non recourse funding to eligible investors who purchased talf eligible asset backed notes sponsored by wfb 
no funding was provided directly to wfb 
the talf program ceased making new loans secured by eligible collateral backed by credit card receivables on march  wfb does not have any significant continuing obligations under the talf program  except that under certain circumstances wfb must notify the frbny and investors if the asset backed notes cease to qualify as eligible collateral under the talf program and wfb agrees to provide certain information regarding the asset backed notes to the frbny 
during  wfb renewed its million and million variable funding facilities that will mature in november and september  resp ectively  and completed an additional million term securitization 
in  wfb intends to issue additional certificates of deposit and additional term securitizations or variable funding facilities 
we believe that these liquidity sources are sufficient to fund wfb foreseeable cash requirements and near term growth plans 
wfb is prohibited by regulations from lending money to cabela or other affiliates 
wfb is subject to capital requirements imposed by nebraska banking law and the visa membership rules  and its ability to pay dividends is also limited by nebraska and federal banking law 
if there are any disruptions in the credit markets  our financial services business  like many other financial institutio ns  may increase its funding from certificates of deposit which may result in increased competition in the deposits market with fewer funds available or at unattractive rates 
our ability to issue certificates of deposit is reliant on our current regulatory capital levels 
wfb is classified as a well capitalized bank  the highest category under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
if wfb were to be classified as an adequately capitalized bank  which is the next level category down from well capitalized  we would be required to obtain a waiver from the fdic in order to continue to issue certificates of deposit 
in addition to the non brokered certificates of deposit market to fund growth and maturing securitizations  we have access to the brokered certificates of deposit market through multiple financial institutions for liquidity and funding purposes 
the ability of our financial services business to engage in securitization transactions on favorable terms or at all could be adversely affected by disruptions in the capital markets or other events  which could materially affect our business and cause our financial services business to lose an important source of capital 
the reform act will also affect a number of significant changes relating to asset backed securities  including additional oversight and regulation of credit rating agencies and additi onal reporting and disclosure requirements 
as a result of the accounting guidance on consolidations and the accounting for transfers of financial assets and the criteria for determining whether to consolidate a variable interest entity  there was uncertainty over fdic guidance regarding the safe harbor for legal isolation of transferred assets provided by fdic rule cfr treatment by the federal deposit insurance corporation as conservator or receiver of financial assets transferred by an insured depository institution in connection with a securitization or participation 
in march  the fdic announced an interim amendment of this regulation 
under the interim amendment  the legal isolation of property transferred in a securitization transaction prior to september   was preserved  regardless of whether the transfer qualified for sal e accounting treatment under new accounting standards if the transfer otherwise complied with the fdic regulation 
on september   the fdic approved a final rule that  subject to certain conditions  preserves the safe harbor treatment applicable to certain grandfathered revolving trusts and master trusts that had issued at least one series of asset backed securities as of such date  which we believe includes the trust 
the final rule imposes significant new conditions on the availability of the safe harbor with respect to securitizations that are not grandfathered 
in addition  several rules and regulations have recently been proposed or adopted that may substantially affect issuers of asset backed securities 
on april   th e sec issued proposed rules that will significantly change the offering process  disclosure  and reporting for asset backed securities 
pursuant to the provisions of the reform act  on january   the sec adopted rules that require issuers of asset backed securities to disclose demand  repurchase  and replacement information through the periodic filing of a new form with the sec 
these rules also require rating agencies to disclose in any report accompanying a credit rating for an asset backed security the representations  warranties  and enforcement mechanisms available to investors and how they differ from those in similar securities 
also pursuant to the provisions of the reform act  on january   the sec issued rules that require issuers of registered asset backed securities to perform a review of the assets underlying the securities and to publicly disclose information relating to the review 
these rules also require issuers of asset backed securities to make publicly available the findin gs and conclusions of any third party due diligence report obtained by the issuer 
it remains to be seen whether and to what extent the january   rules or any other final rules adopted by the sec will impact wfb and its ability and willingness to continue to rely on the securitization market for funding 
at the beginning of  wfb required capital was increased under regulatory capital requirements of the applicable federal agencies as a result of new accounting standards which required the consolidation of the assets and liabilities of the trust on wfb balance sheet 
as of december   the most recent notification from the fdic categorized wfb as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for p rompt corrective action 
in order for our bank subsidiary to continue to meet the minimum requirements for the well capitalized classification under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  we invested million in in additional capital in wfb

wfb classified these notes as asset backed available for sale securities which are reflected in the consolidated balance sheet under the caption retained interests in securitized loans  including asset backed securities 
in  we realized million in proceeds from the disposition of certain premises and equipment 
we purchased million of economic development bonds in financing activities cash provided by financing activities decreased million in compared to this net decrease was primarily due to a net change in wfb s borrowing of time deposits  which wfb utilizes to fund its credit card operations  decreasing million in compared to a net increase of million in our lines of credit  short and long term debt  and the variable funding facility of wfb  decreased million in compared to a decrease of million in economic development bonds and grants in the past  we have negotiated economic development arrangements relating to the construction of a number of our new retail stores  including free land  monetary grants  and the recapture of incremental sales  property  or other taxes through economic development bonds  with many local and state governments 
we design our retail stores to provide exciting tourist and entertainment shopping experiences for the entire family 
our retail stores also employ many people from the local community  draw customer traffic from a broad geographic range  and serve as a catalyst for the opening of additional retail businesses such as restaurants  hotels  and gas stations in the surrounding areas 
we believe these factors increase the revenue for the state and the local municipality where the retail store is located  making us a compelling partner for community development and expansion 
where appropriate  we intend to continue to utilize economic development arrangements with state and local governments to offset some of the construction costs and improve the return on investment of our new retail stores 
economic development bonds through econ omic development bonds  the state or local government sells bonds to provide funding for land acquisition  readying the site  building infrastructure and related eligible expenses associated with the construction and equipping of our retail stores 
in the past  we have primarily been the sole purchaser of these bonds 
the bond proceeds that are received by the governmental entity are then used to fund the construction and equipping of new retail stores and related infrastructure development 
while purchasing these bonds involves an initial cash outlay by us in connection with a new store  some or all of these costs can be recaptured through the repayments of the bonds 
the payments of principal and interest on the bonds are typically tied to sales  property  or lodging taxes generated from the store and  in some cases  from businesses in the surrounding area  over periods which range between and years 
in addition  some of the bonds that we have purchased may be repurchased for par value by the governm ental entity prior to the maturity date of the bonds 
however  the governmental entity from which we purchase the bonds is not otherwise liable for repayment of principal and interest on the bonds to the extent that the associated taxes are insufficient to pay the bonds 
after purchasing the bonds  we typically record them on our consolidated balance sheet classified as available for sale and value them based upon management s projections of the amount of tax revenue expected to be generated to support principal and interest payments on the bonds 
because of the unique features of each project  there is no independent market data for valuation of these types of bonds 
if sufficient tax revenue is not gene rated by the subject properties  we will not receive scheduled payments and will be unable to realize the full value of the bonds carried on our consolidated balance sheet 
at january   and january   economic development bonds totaled million and million  respectively 
the negotiation of these economic development arrangements has been important to our retail store expansion in the past  and these arrangements may be an important factor in our retail store expansion strategy in certain locations because they allow us to avoid or recapture a portion of the costs involved with opening a new store 
grants we generally have received grant funding in exchange for commitments made by us to the state or local government providing the funding 
the commitments  such as assurance of agreed employment and wage levels at our retail stores or that the retail store will remain open  typically phase out over approximately five to ten years 
if we fail to maintain the commitments during the applicable period  the funds we received may have to be repaid or other adverse consequences may arise  which could affect our cash flows and profitability 
at janua ry   and january   the total amount of grant funding subject to specific contractual remedies was million and million  respectively 
securitization of credit card loans our financial services business historically has funded most of its growth in credit card loans through an asset securitization program 
wfb utilizes the trust for the purpose of routinely selling and securitizing credit card loans and issuing beneficial interest to investors 
the trust issues variable funding facilities and long term notes each of which has an undivided interest in the assets of the trust 
wfb must retain a minimum day average of of the loans in the securitization trust which ranks pari passu with the investors interests in the securitization trusts 
in addition  wfb owns notes issued by the trust from some of the securitizations  which in some cases may be subordinated to other notes issued 
wfb retained interests are eliminated upon consolidation of the trust 
the consolidated assets of the trust are subject to credit  payment  and interest rate risks on the transferred credit card loans 
the credit card loans of the trust are restricted for the repayment of the secured borrowings of the trust 
to protect investors  the securitization structures include certain features that could result in earlier than expected repayment of the securities  which could cause wfb to sustain a loss of one or more of its retained interests and could prompt the need for wfb to seek alternative sources of funding 
the primary investor protection feature relates to the availabi lity and adequacy of cash flows in the securitized pool of loans to meet contractual requirements  the insufficiency of which triggers early repayment of the securities 
wfb refers to this as the early amortization feature 
investors are allocated cash flows derived from activities related to the accounts comprising the securitized pool of loans  the amounts of which reflect finance charges collected  certain fee assessments collected  allocations of interchange  and recoveries on charged off accounts 
these cash flows are considered to be restricted under the governing documents to pay interest to investors  servicing fees  and to absorb the investor share of charge offs occurring within the securitized pool of loans 
any cash flows remaining in excess of these requirements are reported to investors as excess spread 
an excess spread of less than zero percent for a contractually specified period  generally a three month average  would trigger an early amortiz ation event 
such an event could result in wfb incurring losses related to its retained interests 
in addition  if wfb retained interest in the loans falls below the minimum day average and wfb fails to add new accounts to the securitized pool of loans  an early amortization event would be triggered 
the investors have no recourse to wfb other assets for failure of debtors to pay other than for breaches of certain customary representations  warranties  and covenants 
these representations  warranties  covenants  and the related indemnities do not protect the trust or third party investors against credit related losses on the loans 
another feature  which is applicable to the notes issued from the trust  is one in which excess cash flows generated by the transferred loans are held at the trust for the benefit of the investors 
this cash reserve account funding is triggered when the three month average excess spread rate of the trust decreases to below or depending on the series with increasing funding requirements as excess spread levels decline below preset levels or as contractually required by the governing documents 
similar to early amortization  this feature also is designed to protect the investors interests from loss thus making the cash restricted 
upon scheduled maturity or early amortization of a securitization  wfb is required to remit principal payments received on the securitized pool of loans to the trust which are restricted for the repayment of the investors principal note 
the total amounts and maturities for our credit card securitizations as of january   were as follows third party total investor third party available available investor expected series type capacity capacity outstanding in terest rate maturity dollars in thousands series iii term fixed october series iii term floating october series iv term fixed september series iv term floating september series i term fixed march series i term floating march series i term fixed january series i term floating january series ii term fixed august series ii term floating august total term series i variable funding floating september series iii variable funding floating nov ember total variable total available we have been  and will continue to be  particularly reliant on funding from securitization transactions for wfb 
a failure to renew existing facilities or to add additional capacity on favorable terms as it becomes necessary could increase our financing costs and potentially limit our ability to grow the business of wfb 
unfavorable conditions in the asset backed securities markets generally  including the unavailability of commercial bank liquidity support or credit enhancements  could have a similar effect 
wfb completed a securitization transaction for million under the talf program in february  and an additional million securitization transaction in september during  wfb renewed its million and million variable funding facilities that will mature in november and september  respectively 
in  wfb intends to issue additional certificates of deposit and additional term securitizations or variable funding facilities 
we believe that these liquidity sources are sufficient to fund wfb foreseeable cash requirements and near term growth plans 
furthermore  wfb securitized credit card loans could experience poor performance  including increased delinquencies and credit losses  lower payment rates  or a decrease in excess spreads below certain thresholds 
this could result in a downgrade or withdrawal of the ratings on the outstanding securities issued in wfb securitization transactions  cause early amortization of these securities  or result in higher required credit enhancement levels 
cr edit card loans performed within established guidelines and no events which could trigger an early amortization occurred during the years ended january   and january  certificates of deposit wfb utilizes brokered and non brokered certificates of deposit to partially finance its operating activiti es 
wfb issues certificates of deposit in a minimum amount of one hundred thousand dollars in various maturities 
at january   wfb had million of certificates of deposit outstanding with maturities ranging from january to april and with a weighted average effective annual fixed rate of 
this outstanding balance compares to million at january   with a weighted average effective annual fixed rate of 
impact of inflation we do not believe that our operating results have been materially affected by inflation during the preceding thre e years 
we cannot assure  however  that our operating results will not be adversely affected by inflation in the future 
contractual obligations and other commercial commitments the following tables provide summary information concerning our future contractual obligations at january  thereafter total in thousands long term debt interest payments on long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases time deposits by maturity interest payments on time deposits secured obligations of the trust interest payments on secured obligations of the trust obligations under new store and expansion arrangements purchase obligations unrecognized tax benefits total td style vertical align bottom  padding left px  padding top px  padding b ottom px  padding right px  excludes amounts owed under capital lease obligations 
these amounts do not include estimated interest payments due under our revolving credit facilities because the amount that will be borrowed under these facilities in future years is uncertain 
at january   obligations for new store and expansion arrangements include approximately million of estimated contractual obligations and commitments associated with projected retail store related expansion and certain obligations under economic development bonds 
the table does not include any amounts for contractual obligations associated with retail store locations where we are in the process of certain negotiations 
our purchase obligations relate primarily to purchases of inventory  shipping  and other goods and services in the ordinary course of business under binding purchase orders or contracts 
the amount of purchase obligations shown is based on assumptions regarding the legal enforceability against us of purchase orders or contracts we had outstanding at the end of under different assumptions regarding our rights to cancel our purchase orders  or different assumptions regarding the enforceability of the purchase orders under applicable laws  the amount of purchase obligations shown in the preceding table would be less 
amounts for unrecognized tax benefits are not reflected in year through since the ultimate amount and timing of any future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty

at january   the total amount of borrowings under this revolving line of credit  including lender letters of credit and standby letters of credit  was million 
our credit agreement for operations in canada is for million cad  of which all is available for borrowing at january  the line of credit for boat and all terrain vehicles fi nancing is limited by the aforementioned million revolving line of credit to million of secured collateral 
the maximum amount that can be borrowed on the federal funds agreements is million 
off balance sheet arrangements operating leases we lease various items of office equipment and buildings 
rent expense for these operating leases is recorded in selling  distribution  and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income 
future obligations are shown in the preceding contractual obligations table 
credit card limits wfb bears off balance sheet risk in the normal course of its business 
one form of this risk is through wfb s commitment to extend credit to cardholders up to the maximum amount of their credit limits 
the aggregate of such potential funding requirements totaled billion above existing balances at the end of these funding obligations are not included on our consolidated balance sheet 
while wfb has not experienced  and does not anticipate that it will experience  a significant draw down of unfunded credit lines by its cardholders  such an event would create a cash need at wfb which likely could not be met by our available cash and funding sources 
wfb has the right to reduce or cancel these available lines of credit at any time 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
management has discussed the development  selection  and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of cabela s board of directors 
while our estimates and assumptions are based on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future  actual results may ultimately differ from our estimates and assumptions 
our estimation processes contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and apply judgment to make these estimates 
should actual results be different than our estimates  we could be exposed to gains or losses from differences that are material 
for a summary of our significant accounting policies  please refer to note of our consolidated financial statements 
we believe the accounting policies discussed below represent accounting policies we apply that are the most critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements 
merchandise revenue recognition revenue is recognized on our internet and catalog sales when merchandise is delivered to customers at the point of delivery  with the point of delivery based on our estimate of shipping time from our distribution centers to the customer 
we recognize reserves for estimated product returns based upon our historical return experience and expectations 
had our estimate of merchandise in transit to customers and our esti mate of product returns been different by at the end of  our operating income would have been higher or lower by approximately million 
sales of gift instruments are recorded in merchandise revenue when the gift instruments are redeemed in exchange for merchandise and as a liability prior to redemption 
we recognize breakage on gift instruments as revenue when the probability of redemption is remote 
had our estimate of breakage on our recorded liability for gift instruments been different by of the recorded liability at the end of  our operating income would have been higher or lower by approximately million 
inventories we estimate provisions for inventory shrinkage  damaged goods returned values  and obsolete and slow moving items based on historical loss and product performance statistics and future merchandising objectives 
while we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future impacting these estimates  actual losses can be higher or lower ba sed on future merchandising decisions and retail economic trends 
had our estimated inventory reserves been different by at the end of  our cost of sales would have been higher or lower by approximately million 
allowance for loan losses on credit cards the allowance for loan losses represents management estimate of probable losses inherent in the credit card loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a charge to the provision for loan losses and is regularly evaluated by management for adequacy 
loans on a payment plan or non accrual are segmented from the rest of the credit card loan portfolio into a restructured credit card loan portfolio before establishing an allowance for loan losses as these loans have a higher probability of loss 
management estimates losses inherent in the credit card loan portfolio based on a model which tracks historical loss experience on delinquent accounts and charge offs  net of estimated recoveries 
wfb uses a migration analysis that estimates the likelihood that a credit card loan will progress through the various stages of delinquency and to charge off 
the migration anal ysis estimates the gross amount of principal that will be charged off over of the next twelve months  net of recoveries 
this estimate is used to derive an estimated allowance 
in addition to these methods of measurement  management also considers other factors such as general economic and business conditions affecting key lending areas  credit concentration  changes in origination and portfolio management  and credit quality trends 
since the evaluation of the inherent loss with respect to these factors is subject to a high degree of uncertainty  the measurement of the overall allowance is subject to estimation risk  and the amount of actual losses can vary significantly from the estimated amounts 
for example  had management estimate of net losses over the next twelve months been different by at the end of  wfb allowance for loan losses and provision for loan losses would have changed by approximately million 
credit card loans that have been modified through a fixed payment plan or placed on non accrual are considered impaired and are collectively evaluated for impairment 
wfb charges off credit card loans segment and restructured credit card loans segment on a daily basis after an account becomes at a minimum days contractually delinquent 
accounts relating to cardholder bankruptcies  cardholder deaths  and fraudulent transactions are charged off earlier 
wfb recognizes charged off cardholder fees and accrued interest receivable in interest and fee income that is included in financial services revenue 
catalog costs deferred catalog costs consist of incremental internal and third party direct costs incurred in the development  production  and circulation of our direct mail catalogs  composed principally of creative design  prepress production  paper  printing  postal  and mailing costs 
deferred catalog costs are amortized over their expected period of future benefit or twelve months  whichever is shorter  based upon sales forecasts developed using historical sales for similar catalog offerings 
deferred catalog ex penses are evaluated for recoverability at each reporting period by comparing the carrying amount associated with each catalog to actual sales data and to projected future cash flows 
had our amortization estimate of deferred catalog costs been different by for  our catalog costs expense would have been higher or lower by approximately million 
long lived assets long lived assets other than goodwill and other intangible assets  which generally are tested separately for impairment on an annual basis  are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
when we evaluate long lived assets for potential impairment  we first compare the carrying value of the asset to that asset s estimated future undiscounted cash flows 
if the estimated fut ure cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset  we then calculate an impairment loss 
the calculation for an impairment loss compares the carrying value of the asset to that asset s estimated fair value  which may be based on estimated future discounted cash flows or quoted market prices 
we recognize an impairment loss if the asset s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value 
if we recognize an impairment loss  the newly adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new basis 
for a depreciable long lived asset  the new cost basis will be depreciated over its remaining useful life 
frequently our impairment loss calculations contain multiple uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values  including forecasting cash flows under different scenarios  determining a discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows  and incorporating financial data from other parties 
we have consistently applied our accounting methodologies that we use to assess impairment loss 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values  we may be exposed to losses that could be material 
economic development bonds we recognize economic development bond investments based on estimates of the discounted future cash payments to be received under these bonds 
these estimates are also the basis for our recognition of deferred grant revenue to be received under the economic development grants as an offset to construction costs which is amortized over the asset lives of the development 
these cash flow estimates are dependent on property and or sales tax collections derived from our operations  and potentially other businesses  some of which may be in the development stage 
had our fair value estimates been lower by as of the end of  the value of economic development bonds reflected in our consolidated financial statements would have been approximately million less with the unrealized loss reflected in comprehensive income loss if the loss was deemed to be temp orary 
any declines in the fair value of held to maturity and available for sale economic development bonds below cost that are deemed to be other than temporary are reflected in earnings as realized losses 
gains and losses on sales are recorded on the trade date and determined using the specific identification method 
recent accounting standards and pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asu no 
 fair value measurements and disclosures topic improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
this guidance revises two disclosure requirements concerning fair value measurements and clarifies two others 
this statement requires separate presentation of significant transfers into and out of levels and of the fair value hierarchy and disclosure of the reasons for such transfers 
it will also require the presentation of purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements within level on a gross basis rather than a net basis 
the amendments also clarify that disclosures should be disaggregated by class of asset or liabili ty and that disclosures about inputs and valuation techniques should be provided for both recurring and non recurring fair value measurements 
the new disclosures about fair value measurements are presented in note to our consolidated financial statements  except for the requirement concerning gross presentation of level activity  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of this statement had no effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in july  the fasb issued asu no 
 disclosures about the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses 
this guidance enhances the existing disclosure requirements providing more transparency of the allowance for loan losses and credit quality of financing receivables 
the new disclosures that relate to information as of the end of a reporting period are effective for our fiscal year end reporting and are presented in notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
the new disclosures that relate to activity occurring during the reporting period will be effective beginning with our first quarter of fiscal item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risk through wfb operations and  to a lesser extent  through our merchandising operations 
we also are exposed to foreign currency risk through our merchandising operations 
financial services interest rate risk interest rate risk refers to changes in earnings due to interest rate changes 
to the extent that interest income collected on credit card loans and interest expense on certificates of deposit and secured borrowings do not respond equally to changes in interest rates  or that rates do not change uniformly  earnings could be affected 
the variabl e rate credit card loans are indexed to the one month london interbank offered rate libor and the credit card portfolio is segmented into risk based pricing tiers each with a different interest margin 
variable rate secured borrowings are indexed to libor based rates of interest and are periodically repriced 
certificates of deposit and fixed rate secured borrowings are priced at the current prevailing market rate at the time of issuance 
we manage and mitigate our interest rate sensitivity through several techniques  but primarily by indexing the customer rates to the same index as our cost of funds 
additional techniques we use include managing the maturity  repricing  and mix of fixed and variable assets and liabilities by issuing fixed rate secured borrowings or certificates of deposit and entering into interest rate swaps 
the table below shows the mix of our credit card account balances at the years ended as a percentage of total balances outstanding balances carrying an interest rate based upon various interest rate indices balances carrying an interest rate of balances carrying an interest rate of balances not carrying interest because their previous month s balance was paid in full charges on the credit cards issued by our financial services segment were priced at a margin over various defined lending rates 
no interest is charged if the account is paid in full within days of the billing cycle  which represented of total balances outstanding as of year end 
some of the zero percentage promotion expenses are passed through to the merchandise vendors for each specific promotion offered 
management has performed several interest rate risk analyses to measure the effects of the timing of the repricing of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities 
based on these analyses  we believe that an immediate decrease of basis points  or  in libor interest char ged to customers and on our cost of funds would cause a pre tax decrease to earnings of million for our financial services segment over the next twelve months 
merchandising business interest rate risk the interest payable on our line of credit is based on variable interest rates and therefore affected by changes in market interest rates 
if interes t rates on existing variable rate debt increased  our interest expense and results from operations and cash flows would not be materially affected 
foreign currency risk we purchase a significant amount of inventory from vendors outside of the united states in transactions that are primarily u 
s 
dollar transactions 
a small percentage of our international purchase transactions are in currencies other than the u 
s 
dollar 
any currency risks related to these transactions are immaterial to us 
a decline in the relative value of the u 
s 
dollar to other foreign currencies could  however  lead to increased merchandise costs 
for our operations in canada  we intend to fund all transactions in canadian dollars and utilize our unsecured revolving credit agreement of million cad to fund such operations
