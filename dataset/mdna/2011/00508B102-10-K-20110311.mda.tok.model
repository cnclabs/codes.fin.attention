our business general actuate corporation we  actuate or the company was incorporated in november in the state of california and reincorporated in the state of delaware in july actuate provides software and services to develop and deploy custom business intelligence and information applications that deliver rich interactive content that improve customer loyalty and corporate performance 
applications built on actuate s open source based platform provide all stakeholders inside and outside the firewall  including employees  customers  partners and citizens with information that they can easily access and understand to maximize revenue  cut costs  improve customer satisfaction  streamline operations  create competitive advantage and make better decisions 
our goal is to ensure that all users can use decision making information in their day to day activities  opening up completely new avenues for improving corporate performance 
december  in thousands financial summary total revenues total operating expenses income from operations operating margins despite the recent global recession  we have achieved year to date profitability and positive cash flows 
we achieved these results not only through our solid execution  leading technology and strong customer relationships  but also because of our commitment to operating efficiencies 
as we aligned our business to weather a turbulent and unpredictable macro economic environment  these efficiencies have resulted in reductions to our operating expenses  after excluding the increased operating expenses as a result of the acquisition of xenos group inc in february nevertheless  our business model and longer term financial results are not immune to a sustained economic downturn 
for example  the recent domestic and global economic downturn resulted in reduced demand for information technology  including enterprise software and services 
the direction and relative strength of the global economy continues to be uncertain and makes it difficult for us to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments 
it is unknown how long the current conditions will persist or whether they will worsen 
information technology spending has historically declined as general economic and market conditions worsened 
during challenging and uncertain economic times and in tight credit markets  many customers delay or reduce technology purchases 
contract negotiations may become more protracted or difficult 
table of contents if customers institute additional internal approvals for technology purchases or require more negotiation of contract terms and conditions 
if these economic conditions return  it could result in reductions in sales of our products  longer sales cycles  difficulties in collection of accounts receivable or delayed payments  slower adoption of new technologies  increased price competition and reductions in the rate at which our customers renew their maintenance agreements and procure consulting services 
furthermore  a significant portion of our revenues have historically been derived from customers in the financial services industry 
the company expects that it will continue to derive a significant portion of its revenues from these financial services customers for the foreseeable future 
unfavorable economic conditions have adversely impacted the financial services industry over the past several years 
if this trend continues  it will likely have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
we continue to monitor market conditions and may make adjustments to our business in order to reduce the adverse impact that changes to the economic environment could have on our business 
we expect to continue to explore both organic and strategic growth opportunities 
in particular  we may acquire companies or technology that can contribute to the strategic  operational and financial performance of our business 
we believe that the combination of our solid financials  leading technology and strong customer relationships will help us successfully execute our strategies 
business model we began shipping our first product in january we sell software products through two primary means i directly to end user customers through our direct sales force and ii through indirect channel partners such as oems  resellers and system integrators 
oems generally integrate our products with their applications and either provide hosting services or resell them with their products 
our other indirect channel partners resell our products to end user customers 
our revenues are derived from license fees for software products and fees for services relating to such products  including software maintenance and support  consulting and training 
fiscal year for the fiscal year ended december   we recorded total revenue of million  an increase of over fiscal year license revenue was million  an increase of over the previous year 
in addition  we generated cash flow from operations of million  which represented an increase of year over year 
diluted earnings per share under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap was in fiscal year as compared to for fiscal for a decrease of 
we ended fiscal with million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  compared with million at december   while having spent approximately million on the acquisition of xenos 
the acquisition of xenos was partially funded with million in additional borrowings under the existing credit facility with wells fargo foothill wff 
we also spent million to repurchase over million shares of our common stock during fiscal in february  we completed the acquisition of xenos group inc xenos  a provider of high performance software solutions that utilize the scalable xenos enterprise server tm and its components to process  extract  transform  repurpose and personalize high volumes of data and documents for storage  real time access  epresentment  printing and delivery in numerous formats across multiple channels 
the acquisition was concluded for total consideration of approximately million million  net of approximately million of xenos cash at the time of the acquisition 
under the terms of the agreement  we completed our tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of xenos common stock at a price of cad per outstanding share 
the transaction was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
actuate has included the financial results of xenos in its consolidated financial statements beginning on the acquisition date 
on september   we entered into a binding memorandum of understanding the mou with international business machines corporation ibm to end a dispute regarding distributions of actuate 
table of contents software by ibm 
under the mou  ibm agreed to pay actuate a total of million within five business days of execution of a definitive agreement  which the parties signed on september  of this total  approximately million was apportioned to license revenue and the remaining million to maintenance revenue during fiscal on june   we entered into an agreement the agreement with oracle to end a dispute regarding distributions of actuate software by oracle 
oracle agreed to pay actuate a total of million 
the terms of the agreement called for equal cash payments by oracle to actuate between june and march and in accordance with a pre determined schedule 
accordingly  actuate expects to recognize revenue when the payments are due 
consequently  every quarter as the payments from oracle become due  approximately million of revenue will be recognized by us 
this amount will be apportioned between license and maintenance revenue based on the maintenance rate dictated in the underlying oracle contract 
since november  we had elected to participate in a rights offering by ubs  the company s investment broker 
the offering provided actuate with rights the put option to sell ubs its ars portfolio at the million par value  at any time during a two year sale period beginning june  prior to the end of the second quarter of fiscal  several of our ars investments were re called and settled by the individual issuers at par value 
in addition  we exercised the put option for all of the remaining ars as of june  and the remaining ars balance totaling million was settled in july of the company held no investments in ars at december  during fiscal  we implemented restructuring actions that resulted in an aggregate charge of  and elimination of positions worldwide  across all levels  primarily within the sales and marketing organization 
also included in the aggregate charges for the year were  idle facilities charge related to the closure of one of our sales facilities in europe 
historically  restructuring charges have included costs associated with reductions in workforce  exits of idle facilities and disposals of fixed assets 
these restructuring charges were based on actual and estimated costs incurred including estimates of sublease income on portions of our idle facilities that we periodically update based on market conditions and in accordance with our restructuring plans 
these estimates were impacted by the rules governing the termination of employees  especially those in foreign countries 
our total headcount at the end of fiscal year was compared to employees at the end of last year 
fiscal year a significant portion of our revenues have historically been derived from customers in the financial services industry 
the company expects that it will continue to derive a significant portion of its revenues from these financial services customers for the foreseeable future 
unfavorable economic conditions starting in late fiscal year have adversely impacted it spending in the financial services industry throughout fiscal year if this trend continues into  it will likely have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
during fiscal year  we expect three additional trends to continue that would have a significant impact on the results of our operations 
we currently believe that corporate it budgets will grow modestly if at all in the fiscal year  particularly among financial services companies in the united states and western europe 
second  corporations are reluctant to buy software from new vendors and we continue to witness corporations consolidating their business intelligence  analytics and performance management software purchases among fewer suppliers 
finally  we expect to experience vigorous competition in the bi market 
several of our competitors have released products that are marketed to be directly competitive with our offerings 
as one of the few independent bi vendors remaining actuate faces competition from large and well established vendors  
table of contents including microsoft  sap  oracle and ibm all of which have acquired bi players to add to their technology stacks 
the existence of these competitive products may require additional sales and marketing efforts to differentiate our products  which could result in extended sales cycles 
we believe that competition in the bi and information applications market will be vigorous in the near future 
for fiscal year  we will continue to pursue the strategic initiatives to improve revenue growth driven by birt  initiatives related to performance management  and pursuing opportunities related to traditional xenos markets which we acquired in these initiatives are as follows investing in birt we are continuing to make a significant investment in birt 
birt has become widely adopted by developers and continues to drive demand for our birt based commercially available products  including actuateone 
the birt project is a core  long term initiative 
selling to it management we are re focusing our sales efforts on selling our products to it managers who we believe generally recognize the technical advantages of our products 
we hope this initiative will result in increased license revenue in the short term 
selling to line of business management we are creating performance management applications and software solutions to market to line of business managers 
these offerings are in the areas of performance management and customer self service reporting 
we hope these initiatives will result in increased license revenue over the medium to long term 
selling to global corporations in the financial services sector we continue to focus on selling our products to global financial services companies in an effort to increase our substantive market share in this sector 
we anticipate a negative impact of the slow recovery in it spending in this sector through however  we believe that once the short term issues in financial services are resolved  the industry will once again lead in the adoption of bi and information applications both inside and outside the firewall 
building out and delivering on the roadmap of applying birt to additional data sources including hard to reach print stream data by investing in the development of birt based xenos offerings 
we have a limited ability to forecast future revenues and expenses  thus the prediction of future operating results is difficult 
in addition  historical growth rates in our revenues and earnings should not be considered indicative of future revenue or earnings growth rates or operating results 
there can be no assurance that any of our business strategies will be successful or that we will be able to achieve and maintain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
it is possible that in some future quarter our operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors  and in such event the price of our common stock could decline 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates general 
the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
we base our estimates  assumptions and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on a regular basis we evaluate our estimates  assumptions and judgments and make changes accordingly 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in revenue recognition  allowances for doubtful accounts  stock based compensation  accounting for income taxes  restructuring and integration costs  allocation of purchase price of acquisitions  and the impairment of goodwill  have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 

table of contents we discuss below the critical accounting estimates associated with these policies 
historically  our estimates  assumptions and judgments relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results 
for further information on our significant accounting policies  see the discussion in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition 
actuate generates revenues from the sales of software licenses and related services 
the company receives software license revenues from licensing its products directly to end users and indirectly through resellers  system integrators and original equipment manufacturers oems 
the company receives service revenues from maintenance contracts  consulting services and training that actuate performs for customers 
if the license agreement contains payment terms indicating that the fee is not fixed or determinable  revenues are recognized as the payments become due and payable  assuming that all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
the significant judgments and estimates for revenue recognition typically relate to the timing of an amount recognized for software license fee revenue  including whether collectability is deemed probable  fees are fixed or determinable and services are essential to the functionality of the software 
changes to these assumptions would generally impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized for software related revenues 
the company typically establishes vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for maintenance and support using a bell shaped curve approach 
however  for certain types of license transactions  including oem and site licenses  the company uses a stated maintenance renewal approach 
the application of these rules requires judgment  including the identification of individual elements in multiple element arrangements  whether there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value  including vsoe of fair value  for some or all elements 
changes to the elements in our sales arrangements  or our ability to establish vsoe or fair value for those elements may result in a material change to the amount of revenue recorded in a given period 
the company assesses the collectability of fees from end users based on payment history and current credit profile 
when a customer is not deemed credit worthy  revenues are deferred and recognized upon cash receipt 
our standard payment terms are net  although we do offer payment terms beyond that 
we periodically provide extended payment terms and we consider any fees due beyond days to not be fixed or determinable 
in such cases  judgment is required in determining the appropriate timing of revenue recognition 
changes to our practice of providing extended payment terms or providing concessions following a sale  may result in a material change to the amount of revenue recorded in a given period 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding revenue recognition 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
our accounts receivable is subject to collection risks 
our gross accounts receivable is reserved against this risk through an allowance for doubtful accounts 
this allowance is for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
it is a significant estimate and is regularly evaluated by us for adequacy by taking into consideration a combination of factors 
we look at factors such as past experience  credit quality of the customer  age of the receivable balance  and current economic conditions 
these factors are reviewed to determine whether a specific reserve for bad debt should be recorded to reduce the related receivable to the amount believed to be collectible 
we also cease recognizing future revenues on any outstanding domestic maintenance renewal invoices which are older than days past due 
we also record unspecified reserves for bad debt for all other customers based on a variety of factors  including length of time the receivables are past due and historical experience 
a reserve percentage is applied to various aged categories of receivables based on historical experience to determine how much of an unspecified reserve is needed 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different allowance balances 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required 

table of contents stock based compensation 
we recognize stock based compensation expense over the service period for awards that are expected to vest based on the fair value measurement for all share based payment awards made to our employees and directors  including employee stock options  restricted stock units and employee stock purchases 
we calculate the fair value of each stock option award on the date of grant using the black scholes merton option pricing model 
the determination of fair value is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
the use of a black scholes merton model requires extensive actual employee exercise behavior data and a number of complex assumptions including expected life  expected volatility  risk free interest rate and expected forfeiture rate 
as a result  the future stock based compensation expense may differ from our historical amounts 
our estimate of volatility is based upon the historical volatility experienced in our stock price 
to the extent volatility of our stock price increases in the future  our estimates of the fair value of options granted in the future could increase  thereby increasing stock based compensation expense in future periods 
in addition  we apply an expected forfeiture rate when amortizing stock based compensation expense 
our estimate of the forfeiture rate is based primarily upon historical experience 
to the extent we revise this estimate in the future our stock based compensation expense could be materially impacted in the quarter of revision  as well as in following quarters 
our estimate of the expected term of options granted is derived from historical share option exercise experience 
in the future  we may change our estimate of the expected term  which would impact the fair value of our options granted in the future 
income taxes 
we provide for the effect of income taxes in our consolidated financial statements using the asset and liability method which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements 
under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date 
we also apply a two step approach to determining the financial statement recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions 
income tax expense or benefit is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year  and for deferred tax assets and liabilities for the tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
we must make significant assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine our current provision benefit for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our deferred tax assets 
our judgments  assumptions and estimates relating to the current provision benefit for income taxes include the geographic mix and amount of income loss  our interpretation of current tax laws  and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
our judgments also include anticipating the tax positions we will record in the financial statements before actually preparing and filing the tax returns 
our estimates and assumptions may differ from the actual results as reflected in our income tax returns and we record the required adjustments when they are identified or resolved 
changes in our business  tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws  and developments in current and future tax audits  could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to tax benefit carry forwards and to differences between the financial statement amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
to make this assessment  we take into account predictions of the amount and category of taxable income from various sources and all available positive and negative evidence about these possible sources of taxable income 
the weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the strength of the evidence can be objectively verified 
based on the analysis of positive and negative 
table of contents factors noted above  we have no valuation allowance against deferred tax assets generated in the company s us jurisdiction 
we maintain a full valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions with a history of losses and a partial valuation allowance in foreign jurisdictions where operating results beyond a certain time frame are less reliable 
if  in the future  we determine that these deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized  a release of all or part  of the related valuation allowance could result in an income tax benefit in the period such determination is made 
we only recognize an income tax expense or benefit with respect to uncertain tax positions in our financial statements that we judge is more likely than not to be sustained solely on its technical merits in a tax audit  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes 
to make this judgment  we must interpret complex and sometimes ambiguous tax laws  regulations and administrative practices 
if an income tax position meets the more likely than not recognition threshold  then we must measure the amount of the tax benefit to be recognized by determining the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than a likelihood of being realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all of the relevant facts 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible settlement outcomes 
to determine if a tax position is effectively settled  we must also estimate the likelihood that a taxing authority would review a tax position after a tax examination has otherwise been completed 
we must also determine when it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease in the months after each fiscal year end 
these judgments are difficult because a taxing authority may change its behavior as a result of our disclosures in our financial statements 
we must reevaluate our income tax positions on a quarterly basis to consider factors such as changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit  and new audit activity 
such a change in recognition or measurement would result in recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 
accrual for restructuring charges 
we incurred certain restructuring charges that were a combination of reductions in workforce  exits of idle facilities and disposals of fixed assets 
these restructuring charges were based on actual and estimated costs incurred  including estimates of sublease income on portions of our idle facilities 
we periodically update the estimates based on market conditions and in accordance with our restructuring plans 
updates to estimates of sublease income were not significant in fiscal years  and acquisitions purchase price allocation 
we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed  based on their respective fair values at the acquisition date 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the underlying acquired net tangible and intangible assets  if any  is recorded as goodwill 
management estimates the fair value of assets and liabilities based upon quoted market prices  and widely accepted valuation techniques 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable  they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain 
examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from software license sales  subscriptions  support agreements  consulting contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents  expected costs to develop the in process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed  the acquired company s trade name and trademarks as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name and trademarks will continue to be used in the combined company s product portfolio  and discount rates 

table of contents in connection with the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions  we estimate the fair value of the deferred revenue obligations assumed 
we adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation  as necessary  typically up to one year after the acquisition closing date as we obtain more information regarding asset valuations and liabilities assumed 
for additional discussion  see note  acquisition of xenos group inc  of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this form k 
valuation of goodwill 
we evaluate goodwill  at a minimum  on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  and whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill  to the fair value of the reporting unit 
the company begins its impairment test by applying a market approach 
given the company has one reporting unit  this approach involves comparing the market capitalization of the company to its carrying value 
if this market approach derives a fair value that significantly exceeds the carrying value of the company then no further testing is performed 
however  if the market approach indicates the fair value does not significantly exceed the carrying value of the company  we perform a supplemental calculation of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit using an income approach 
we then consider the results of both the market approach and income approach to determine whether or not it is necessary to move to the second step of the goodwill impairment analysis in order to measure the amount of any impairment loss 
thus far  the market approach has consistently indicated that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was significantly higher than the carrying value 
therefore  we have determined that there has been no impairment and consequently it has not been necessary to perform a supplemental income approach to the valuation

the increase in our total revenues in fiscal was primarily due to a favorable transaction with ibm totaling million  which ended a dispute regarding distributions of actuate software by ibm  revenues from our acquisition of xenos  which was completed in february of  and revenues from our transaction with oracle during the second quarter of  which ended a dispute regarding distributions of actuate software by oracle 
the agreement required oracle to pay actuate a total of million 
the terms of the agreement called for equal cash payments by oracle to actuate between june and march in accordance with a pre determined schedule 
accordingly  actuate recognizes the revenue similar to an extended payment term contract 
consequently  every quarter as the payments from oracle become due  approximately million of revenue is recognized by actuate 
this amount is apportioned between license and maintenance revenue based on the maintenance rate dictated in the underlying oracle contract 

table of contents we also experienced an increase in our professional services revenues due primarily to the acquisition of xenos 
despite this increase  the professional services revenues remain weak mainly due to a challenging economy which is causing some customers to either delay their projects or cancel their engagements 
we believe some customers continue to utilize their in house resources to complete previously outsourced projects 
another factor contributing to the weakness in the professional services environment is the increase in the adoption of birt based projects by our customers 
these birt based projects do not require professional service to the same extent as the company s traditional designer products 
despite the ibm and oracle transactions  which were apportioned between license and maintenance revenue  we experienced lower maintenance and support revenues during fiscal as continued reductions in our license revenues from the onset of the global recession in early has resulted in a negative compounding effect on our maintenance revenues 
we also continue to experience higher declines in maintenance renewals primarily related to certain of our legacy products 
revenues outside of north america remained almost unchanged at million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal year these international revenues represented of our total revenues versus in the same period last year 
foreign currency exchange losses negatively impacted our international revenues by approximately  during fiscal for fiscal year we closed approximately transactions in excess of  compared to in fiscal year in addition  we recognized license revenue of million or more on transactions during fiscal year compared to transactions in fiscal year the number of orders greater than million has historically ranged from none to three per quarter 
we do not expect to rely on any one customer for our future business 
for fiscal  we attribute a significant portion of the decline in our revenues to our professional services business 
as in fiscal  this decrease was mainly due to a weak macro economic environment which was causing some customers to either delay their projects or cancel their engagements 
we believe some customers were opting to use in house resources to complete previously outsourced projects 
another factor contributing to the decrease in the professional services revenues was the increase in the adoption of birt based projects by our customers which do not require professional service to the same extent as the company s traditional designer products

approximately million of this decrease in international revenues was due to the unfavorable impact of exchange rate fluctuations on revenue transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
for fiscal year we managed to close approximately transactions in excess of  compared to in fiscal year in addition  we recognized license revenue of million or more on transactions during fiscal year compared to transactions in fiscal year the number of orders greater than million has historically ranged from none to three per quarter

the decrease in license revenues for fiscal year over the same period in the prior year was primarily due to weak macro economic conditions that adversely impacted the financial services industry  a key component of actuate s customer portfolio

the decrease in services revenues in fiscal was driven primarily by a decrease in our non xenos maintenance and support revenues 
this decrease in our maintenance and support revenues was triggered by reductions in our license revenues from the onset of the global recession in early which has resulted in a negative compounding effect on our maintenance revenues 
in addition  we continue to experience higher declines in maintenance renewals primarily related to certain of our legacy products 
partially offsetting these decreases were increases in maintenance and support revenues from the ibm and oracle transactions 
our professional services and consulting revenues increased during fiscal compared with fiscal mainly because of the acquisition of xenos in february excluding xenos  our professional services revenues continue to decline from fiscal levels as we saw an increase in the adoption of birt based projects by our customers during the year 
we experienced a growth in our birt related business during fiscal these birt based projects do not require professional service to the same extent as the company s traditional designer products 
our average non xenos professional consulting headcount for fiscal was compared with last year 
the decrease in services revenues for fiscal was driven primarily by a decrease in our professional services and consulting revenues 
as was discussed above  our non xenos related professional services revenues declined mostly due to a weak macro economic environment  which caused some customers to either delay their projects or cancel their engagements 
we believe some customers opted to use in house resources to complete previously outsourced projects 
another factor contributing to the decrease in the professional services revenues was the increase in the adoption of birt based projects by our customers  which do not require professional service to the same extent as the company s traditional designer products 
we experienced a growth in our birt related business during fiscal despite weakness in license sales  our maintenance renewal revenues remained stable in fiscal as we secured several large compliance deals that included a back maintenance component

the increase in cost of license fees in absolute dollars for the fiscal year  compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year  was due primarily to the amortization of xenos purchased intangibles  which we started amortizing in february of and third party commissions incurred on the sale of xenos software 
the decrease in cost of license fees in absolute dollars for fiscal compared to the corresponding period in fiscal was due primarily to the full amortization of purchased technologies in fiscal associated with our december purchase of third party source code

table of contents costs incurred in providing training and consulting services 
the increase in cost of services for fiscal  compared to the corresponding period in the prior year  was primarily due to our acquisition of xenos in february of this increase was partially offset by decreases in employee compensation and related costs 
we experienced continued reductions in consulting revenues as demand for actuate s professional services engagements decreased during fiscal as a result  we reduced our average non xenos professional consulting headcount by approximately or employees from in fiscal to employees during fiscal these reductions in headcount translated to lower compensation  employee benefits  travel and third party consulting expenses for non xenos professional services personnel  totaling approximately  during fiscal these reductions in cost were offset by an overall increase in cost of services due to our acquisition of xenos in february of the decrease in cost of services for fiscal  compared to fiscal  was primarily due to the decrease in consulting revenues as demand for actuate s professional services engagements continued to decrease during fiscal in response to this decrease in services engagement opportunities  we reduced our cost structure during the second half of fiscal and continued these reductions throughout fiscal consequently  we reduced our average professional consulting headcount by approximately or employees from in fiscal to employees in fiscal as a result of these reductions  employee compensation and travel costs decreased by approximately million during fiscal third party consulting fees also decreased by approximately million in fiscal compared to the same period last year 
this was a direct result of an intentional reduction in the use of external contractors to staff engagements 
finally  during fiscal internal costs allocated to the services group decreased by approximately million  primarily due to a decrease in consulting revenues and reduced headcount in the services group upon which the allocations are based 
we currently expect cost of services to be in the range of to of total services revenues for fiscal sales and marketing year ended december  change change change change to to dollars in thousands percent of total revenue sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and bonuses earned by sales and marketing personnel  stock based compensation  promotional expenses  travel  entertainment and facility costs 
non xenos sales and marketing expenses decreased in almost every category during fiscal compensation related expenses decreased by approximately million as our average non xenos headcount decreased by approximately or employees from in fiscal to during fiscal most of the decrease in compensation expense was driven by lower salaries and benefits due to these headcount reductions 
these decreases were partially offset by higher commissions due to increase in license revenues 
we also continued our efforts to streamline our processes and lower operating expenses 
significant decreases were reflected in lower contractor costs of approximately  lower travel expenses of approximately  and lower marketing program expenses of approximately million 
the remaining reductions in marketing expenses were due to consolidation and streamlining of programs as well as scaling down of event costs 
these decreases were offset by increased operating expenses as a result of our acquisition of xenos in february of for fiscal  the decrease in sales and marketing expenses compared to the corresponding period in fiscal was primarily due to reductions in employee related expenses 
salaries  sales commissions  and stock based 
table of contents compensation and employee travel combined to account for approximately million of the decrease in fiscal expenses 
these reductions were mostly due to the drop in license revenues  which translated into lower sales commissions 
our average sales and marketing headcount also decreased by  or employees  from in fiscal to in fiscal our lower headcount also resulted in a reduction in recruiting fees of approximately  we also continued our ongoing efforts to streamline our processes and lower expenses 
because of this  our annual corporate kickoff and sales training expenses were significantly lower in fiscal as compared to fiscal marketing programs decreased by approximately  in fiscal as compared to fiscal as we combined the actuate international user conference with our annual sales kick off events into one 
finally  we reversed approximately  in legal fees as a result of a case settlement related to the fiscal employee termination in one of our european sales divisions 
we currently expect our sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues to increase as we expect to grow our sales force during fiscal as a result  we expect sales and marketing expenses to be in the range of to of total revenues for fiscal research and development year ended december  change change change change to to dollars in thousands percent of total revenue research and development costs are expensed as incurred and consist primarily of personnel and related costs associated with the development of new products  the enhancement of existing products  quality assurance and testing 
the increase in research and development expenses in fiscal was primarily due to the acquisition of xenos in february of and an increase in non xenos salaries associated with the annual merit increases 
the decrease in research and development expenses in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily attributed to employee compensation and related costs 
total worldwide research and development headcount decreased by employees from at the end of fiscal to at the end of fiscal also  during fiscal  we shifted a portion of our research and development headcount away from north america where employee costs are higher and into china  where employee costs are significantly lower 
the benefit of this shift was fully realized in fiscal we believe that continued investments in technology and product development are essential for us to remain competitive in the markets we serve  and expect our research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenues to be in the range of to of total revenues for fiscal general and administrative year ended december  change change change change to to dollars in thousands percent of total revenue 
table of contents general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  stock based compensation and related costs in finance  human resources  legal and tax functions  as well as audit and legal fees and bad debt expense 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal was primarily due to increased legal fees of approximately million resulting primarily from contract compliance matters 
our acquisition of xenos during the first quarter of also accounted for some of the increase 
we have other ongoing litigation with certain customers relating to their compliance with our license and services agreements and consequently we expect to incur legal fees associated with our contract compliance matters in the future 
nonetheless  we expect the level of legal fees to decline significantly in the near term because of the settlement of several large compliance matters and the current state of the remainder of the company s pending litigation 
the increases in expenses were partially offset by a reduction in stock based compensation as we issued fewer stock option grants to our employees during fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal are primarily due to increased legal fees of approximately million due mostly to contract compliance matters pursued during the year 
we also incurred approximately  of legal fees associated with the acquisition of xenos which were mostly incurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal these increases were partially offset by a reduction of approximately  in employee compensation  benefits and recruiting fees due to reduced headcount which decreased from at fiscal to at the end of fiscal we also benefited from a business tax refund of approximately  in china during the year 
we anticipate our general and administrative expenses to be in the range of to of total revenues for fiscal amortization of purchased intangibles year ended december  change change change change to to dollars in thousands percent of total revenue in accordance with the authoritative guidance issued by fasb related to goodwill and other intangible assets  we perform a goodwill impairment test at least annually  which we complete on october of each year 
these annual impairment tests have not resulted in an impairment of recorded goodwill in fiscal  or amortization expense increased during fiscal as compared to the same period in fiscal due to amortization expense associated with intangibles assets purchased through the acquisition of xenos 
these purchased intangibles are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of seven years 
in addition  as a result of our acquisition of performancesoft in the first quarter of fiscal  we acquired purchased intangibles which were amortized over their estimated useful lives of five years and were fully amortized at the end of fiscal the amortization expense is lower in fiscal when compared to fiscal as some intangibles related to our prior acquisitions were fully amortized at the end fiscal we expect amortization expense related to other purchased intangible assets to slightly decrease in fiscal as purchased intangibles from our acquisition of performancesoft were fully amortized during fiscal

interest expense totaling approximately million was recorded on the utilized portion of our credit facility with wells fargo foothill wff during fiscal as compared to approximately million in fiscal the increase in interest expense was due to million in additional borrowings under the existing credit facility with wff and was used to fund the acquisition of xenos which was completed on february  during fiscal  we also recorded unused line fees and amortization of debt issuance costs of approximately  for the year ended december   the decrease in interest income compared to fiscal was due to an overall decrease in interest rates and lower average cash balances 
the rate of return on our investment portfolio dropped significantly in although the cash and investments balance was higher at the end fiscal it was lower on average during the span of the year

to the extent that non cash items increase or decrease our future operating results  there will be no corresponding impact on our cash flows 
after excluding the effects of these non cash charges  the primary changes in cash flows relating to operating activities result from changes in working capital 
our primary source of operating cash flows is the collection of accounts receivable from our customers  including maintenance which is typically billed annually in advance 
our overall maintenance revenues comprised of our total revenues in fiscal and we believe that future proceeds from maintenance renewals will be the primary source of our

our operating cash flows are also impacted by the timing of payments to our vendors for accounts payable and other liabilities 
we generally pay our vendors and service providers in accordance with the invoice terms and conditions 
the timing of cash payments in future periods will be impacted by the terms of accounts payable arrangements 
the primary uses of cash from operations consist of salaries  commissions and bonuses paid to our employees 
we pay our employees on a semi monthly basis and we generally pay our vendors within one month from receiving an invoice for services rendered 
we are also contractually committed to pay rent and facility related charges in support of our worldwide operations 
as of december   we remained contractually committed to million in net operating lease obligations related to our worldwide facilities 
the majority of these commitments are due within the next three years

cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  the primary driver for the cash used during fiscal was the acquisition of xenos which resulted in a net cash payment of approximately million 
this cash payment is net of approximately million of acquired cash from xenos 
we funded the acquisition by using a combination of approximately million of company s cash and investment reserves and borrowed million under our existing credit facility with wells fargo foothill wff 
the remaining increase in cash used primarily relates to the timing of purchases and maturities of marketable securities 
cash flows from financing activities cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  during the fiscal  we borrowed an additional million under our existing credit facility with wells fargo foothill wff to partially fund the acquisition of xenos which was completed in february offsetting these proceeds were approximately million in payments associated with our share buyback program that resulted in the repurchase of  shares of actuate stock during fiscal finally  proceeds from exercise of employee stock options  offset by associated tax benefits accounted for the remainder of the net proceeds from financing activities for fiscal fiscal year cash flows from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities of million for fiscal was primarily comprised of net income plus the net effect of non cash expenses 
the primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with increases in deferred revenue  and changes in operating assets driven by timing differences in prepaid expenses and other current assets and liabilities 
the increase in deferred revenues was primarily due to several transactions that were recorded and billed at the end of fiscal as well as several multi year maintenance renewal billings for which we were able to obtain customer commitment and invoice in advance 
our overall maintenance revenues comprised over of our total revenues in fiscal in order to fund our on going operations  we rely heavily on timely collections of our accounts receivable 
our accounts receivable and dso are primarily driven by our billing and collections activities 
based on the latest fiscal quarter  our dso was days at december  and days for the same period in fiscal the increase in dso along with an increase in accounts receivable balance primarily relates to several transactions recorded and billed at the end of fiscal as well as a stronger focus on maintenance renewal follow up by our maintenance renewal group that resulted in acceleration of billings at the end of fiscal we

fiscal year cash flows from operating activities cash provided by operations is dependent primarily upon collection of monies from our license and maintenance agreements which consist of software fees and for ongoing support and unspecified product updates 
our maintenance revenues have historically remained the primary source of our operating cash flows

thereafter  if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may find it necessary to sell additional equity  or obtain additional credit facilities 
the sale of additional equity could result in additional dilution to our current stockholders 
a portion of our cash may be used to acquire or invest in complementary businesses  including the acquisition of the minority interest in our owned subsidiary in japan  or complementary products or to obtain the right to use complementary technologies

the floating rate is determined at the company s election and may either be i london interbank offered rate libor or ii the greater of the federal funds rate plus an applicable margin and the prime rate 
if the company s usage of the credit line exceeds of its trailing four quarters of recurring maintenance revenue  or if the sum of available funds under the credit agreement plus available cash is less than million  the company is required to meet certain minimum income targets and be subject to a limit on annual capital expenditures 
as of december   the company was able to meet the test as well as the million minimum cash threshold and was therefore not subject to the income or the capital expenditures covenants 
the company is required to make interest payments and pay an unused commitment fee on a monthly basis 
the company incurred approximately million of interest expense on the utilized portion of the credit facility in the fiscal compared with million in fiscal the increase in the interest expense in fiscal was due to million in additional borrowings under the credit facility which was used to fund the acquisition of xenos in february during fiscal  we recorded unused line fees and amortization of debt issuance costs of approximately  compared with approximately  during the same period last year

the company believes that cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet its current debt service requirements for interest and any payments under the credit agreement 
however  if such cash flow is not sufficient  the company may be required to issue additional debt or equity securities  refinance its obligations  or take other actions in order to make such scheduled payments 
the company cannot be sure that it would be able to effect any such transactions on favorable terms  if at all and failure to do so may cause an event of default under the credit agreement  which will have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial conditions

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk 
market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
our market risk exposure is primarily a result of credit risk  fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
foreign currency exchange risk 
during fiscal years  and we derived  and  respectively  of our total revenues from sales outside of north america 
we face exposure to market risk on the related receivables with respect to fluctuations in the relative value of currencies 
our international revenues and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies  principally the euro and the british pound sterling 
the functional currency of each of our foreign subsidiaries is the local currency 
we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  transaction gains and losses may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected profitability 
our losses due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations were approximately million in fiscal   in fiscal and approximately million during fiscal we performed a sensitivity analysis on the net monetary accounts subject to revaluation that are held primarily by our international subsidiaries 
we used the following steps to determine the approximate impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations identified material net monetary assets held in non functional currencies 
these primarily consist of the euro  british pound  canadian dollar  and the us dollar based net assets held by our international subsidiaries 
applied hypothetical changes in exchange rates to these net monetary balances held by each subsidiary as identified above 
the result was a hypothetical revaluation gain or loss in the subsidiary s functional currency 
we then translated the revaluation result as described above to us dollars using the latest quarter average exchange rate 
this resulted in hypothetical revaluation gains or losses before income taxes 
these hypothetical results are summarized in the table below as of december  annual change in currency exchange in thousands interest rate risk 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest primarily in highly liquid and high quality debt securities 
due to the nature of our investments  we believe that there is limited risk exposure 
we also have a million loan with wells fargo foothill which we used to partially fund our tender offer in the fourth quarter of and our acquisition of xenos in the first quarter of we performed a sensitivity analysis on the outstanding portion of this loan as of december  the analysis is based on an estimate of the hypothetical changes in annual interest expense that would result from an immediate increase decrease in interest rates 
the analysis is shown as of december  annual change in interest expense in thousands 
table of contents credit risk 
financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents  investments in marketable securities  and trade accounts receivable 
we have policies that limit investments in investment grade securities and the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we sell primarily to customers in the financial services industry  predominantly in the united states and europe 
accordingly  unfavorable economic conditions adversely impacting the financial services industry has had a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
for example  the financial services industry has experienced and may continue to experience cyclical fluctuations in profitability  which may affect timing of  or actual purchases of  our products which would have a material adverse effect on the our business  financial condition and results of operations 
there was no customer that accounted for more than of total sales in fiscal we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain an allowance for potential credit losses 
we do not require collateral or other security to support customer receivables
