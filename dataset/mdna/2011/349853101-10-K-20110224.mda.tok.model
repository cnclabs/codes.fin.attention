item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview and executive summary our operations can be broadly classified into two principal segments forward air and fasi 
through our forward air segment  we are a leading provider of time definite surface transportation and related logistics services to the north american deferred air freight market 
we offer our customers local pick up and delivery forward air complete and scheduled surface transportation of cargo as a cost effective  reliable alternative to air transportation 
we transport cargo that must be delivered at a specific time  but is less time sensitive than traditional air freight 
this type of cargo is frequently referred to in the transportation industry as deferred air freight 
we operate our forward air segment through a network of terminals located on or near airports in cities in the united states and canada  including a central sorting facility in columbus  ohio and regional hubs serving key markets 
we also offer our customers an array of logistics and other services including tlx  dedicated fleets  warehousing  customs brokerage  and shipment consolidation  deconsolidation and handling 
fasi provides pool distribution services throughout the mid atlantic  southeast  midwest and southwest continental united states 
pool distribution involves managing high frequency handling and distribution of time sensitive product to numerous destinations in specific geographic regions 
our primary customers for this product are regional and nationwide distributors and retailers  such as mall  strip mall and outlet based retail chains 
we service these customers through a network of terminals and service centers located in cities 
our operations  particularly our network of hubs and terminals  represent substantial fixed costs 
consequently  our ability to increase our earnings depends in significant part on our ability to increase the amount of freight and the revenue per pound or carton for the freight shipped through our networks and to grow other lines of businesses  such as tlx  which will allow us to maintain revenue growth in challenging shipping environments 
trends and developments acquisitions on september   we acquired certain assets and liabilities of service express 
service express was a privately held provider of pool distribution services primarily in the mid atlantic and southeastern continental united states 
service express generated approximately million in revenue during the year ended december  the acquisition of service express pool distribution services added to the geographic footprint of the fasi segment in the mid atlantic and southeastern united states 
on march   we acquired certain assets and liabilities of pinch 
pinch was a privately held provider of pool distribution  airport to airport  truckload  customs  and cartage services primarily to the southwestern continental united states 
pinch generated approximately million in revenue during the year ended december  the acquisition of pinch s pool distribution services expanded the geographic footprint of the fasi segment in the southwestern united states 
in addition  it provided additional tonnage density to the forward air airport to airport network  and the acquisition of pinch s cartage and truckload business provided an opportunity for forward air to expand its service options in the southwestern united states 
results from operations during the year ended december   driven by our forward air segment we experienced significant year over year increases in our consolidated revenues and results from operations 
we largely attribute the increase in forward air revenue and income from operations to the improving economic conditions and its effects on our overall business volumes and the rates we are able to charge for our core services 
fasi revenue was consistent year over year 
fasi revenue growth was impeded by customer losses during which were mostly offset by new business wins 
in particular  during the second quarter of  we ceased providing services to one of fasi s largest customers at the time 
these customer losses resulted in approximately million less fasi revenue in compared to  but these losses were offset by new customer wins 
while the customer losses mitigated revenue growth during and will continue to lessen fasi s revenue growth during the first half of  the lost revenue was low yielding and the anticipated impact on operating results from curtailing these services has been minimal 
the improvement in fasi s loss from operations in as compared to is largely attributable to including a million impairment of goodwill  as well as the removal of a poor performing customer account and improvements in operational efficiency during throughout fuel prices increased notably over our net fuel surcharge revenue is the result of our fuel surcharge rates  which are set weekly using the national average for diesel price per gallon  and the tonnage transiting our network 
the increase in shipping activity combined with the increasing diesel fuel prices have resulted in an increase in our net fuel surcharge revenue 
total net fuel surcharge revenue increased during compared to segments our operations can be broadly classified into two principal segments forward air and fasi 
our forward air segment includes our airport to airport network  forward air complete  and tlx services as well as our other accessorial related services such as warehousing  customs brokerage  and value added handling services 
our fasi segment includes our pool distribution business 
goodwill during the first quarter of  we determined there were indicators of potential impairment of the goodwill assigned to the fasi segment 
this determination was based on the economic recession experienced in and the resulting declines in market valuations and fasi operating losses in excess of expectations 
as a result  we performed an interim impairment test 
we calculated the fair value of the fasi segment  using a combination of discounted cash flows and current market valuations for comparable companies 
based on the results of the interim impairment test  we recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million related to the fasi segment during the first quarter of in accordance with our accounting policy  we conducted our annual impairment test of goodwill for each reportable segment as of june  and and no further impairment charges were required 
as of december   the carrying value of goodwill related to the forward air and fasi segments was million and million  respectively 
the estimation of fair value related to the impairment test for goodwill is particularly sensitive to projected financial information used in the calculations 
earnings estimated to be generated by our forward air segment are expected to continue supporting the carrying value of its goodwill 
our fasi segment is currently facing the challenges of building and expanding a business during difficult economic times 
if these overall economic conditions worsen or continue for an extended period of time  future estimates of projected financial information may be reduced  and we may be required to record an additional impairment charge against the carrying value of fasi s goodwill

our airport to airport business is priced on a per pound basis and the average revenue per pound  excluding the impact of fuel surcharges and complete  increased for the year ended december  versus the year ended december  tonnage that transited our network increased by during the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  the increase in tonnage was primarily driven by the improved economic conditions during and the resulting increase in shipping activity 
average base revenue per pound increased as a result of a general rate increase implemented on may  the remaining increase in airport to airport revenue is the result of increased net fuel surcharge revenue and complete pick up and delivery revenue 
net fuel surcharge revenue increased million during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  as a result of higher average fuel prices and increased overall business volumes 
complete pick up and delivery revenue increased million during the year ended december  compared to the increase in complete revenue is attributable to an increased attachment rate of the complete service to our standard airport to airport service and the overall improvement in tonnage volumes during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  logistics revenue  which is primarily tlx and priced on a per mile basis  increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  tlx revenue increased million and year over year as tlx average revenue per mile increased approximately in compared to while miles driven to support our tlx revenue increased from to similar to our airport to airport service  tlx miles increased in conjunction with the improving economy and the resulting increase in shipping activity 
the increase in average revenue per mile is mainly attributable to increased fuel surcharges as a result of higher fuel prices and increased yield per mile as the increase in shipping activity has resulted in decreased available truckload capacity and reduced truckload price competition 
the remaining million increase in logistics revenue was attributable to increases in other non mileage based logistic revenues  such as drayage 
the increase in non mileage based services was in conjunction with the improvement in tlx business volumes 
other revenue  which includes warehousing services and terminal handling  accounts for the final component of forward air operating revenue 
other revenue increased million  or  to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  the increase in revenue was primarily due to increases in local terminal handling and sorting services  such as freight and container transfers  that increased in conjunction with our efforts to increase terminal utilization during off peak hours 
fasi fasi operating revenue was million for both the year ended december  and fasi operating revenue was consistent year over year in total  but included significant customer losses discussed above that were offset by various new business wins for which service began at various times throughout and the customer losses resulted in approximately million less fasi revenue in compared to the new business wins were largely expansion of services with previously existing customers 
intercompany eliminations intercompany eliminations increased million  or  to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  the intercompany eliminations are the result of truckload and airport to airport services forward air provided to fasi 
fasi also provided cartage and station agent services to forward air 
the increase in intercompany eliminations was the result of increased agent station services fasi provided to forward air during the year ended december  purchased transportation purchased transportation increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of total operating revenue  purchased transportation was during the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december forward air forward air s purchased transportation increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in purchased transportation is primarily attributable to an increase of approximately in miles driven and a increase in the total cost per mile for the year ended december  versus the year ended december  as a percentage of segment operating revenue  forward air purchased transportation was during the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  purchased transportation costs for our airport to airport network increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   purchased transportation for our airport to airport network decreased to of airport to airport revenue from for the year ended december  the million increase is attributable to a increase in miles driven by our network of owner operators or third party transportation providers in addition to a increase in cost per mile paid to our network of owner operators or third party transportation providers 
the increase in miles increased purchased transportation by million while the increase in cost per mile increased purchased transportation million 
miles driven by our network of owner operators or third party transportation providers increased in conjunction with the tonnage increase discussed above 
the increase in airport to airport cost per mile was the result of increased utilization of more costly third party transportation providers as opposed to our network of owner operators 
we increased our use of third party transportation provides in order to fill the capacity required by the increased business volumes discussed above 
in addition to these increases in airport to airport purchased transportation was a million increase in expenses for third party transportation costs associated with the increased customer utilization of complete 
purchased transportation costs for our logistics revenue increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   logistics purchased transportation costs represented of logistics revenue versus for the year ended december  the increase in logistics purchased transportation was largely attributable to the million  or  increase in tlx purchased transportation 
miles driven to support our tlx revenue increased and the cost per mile increased approximately during compared to the increase in cost per mile was mostly attributable to the increased utilization of our more costly third party transportation providers as opposed to our network of owner operators 
other non mileage based logistics purchased transportation costs related to our drayage and other services increased million 
purchased transportation costs related to our other revenue increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  other purchased transportation costs as a percentage of other revenue increased to of other revenue for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase in other purchased transportation costs as a percentage of other revenue is attributable to our efforts to increase local terminal revenue streams 
these alternate revenue streams often require the use of more costly third party transportation providers  as opposed to company employed drivers or our network of owner operators 
fasi fasi purchased transportation increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  fasi purchased transportation as a percentage of revenue was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increase in fasi purchased transportation in total dollars and as a percentage of revenue is attributable to our efforts to shift fasi to a more variable cost model by increasing the use of owner operators as opposed to company employed drivers 
intercompany eliminations intercompany eliminations were million for the years ended december  and the intercompany eliminations are the result of truckload and airport to airport services forward air provided to fasi during the year end december  fasi also provided cartage services to forward air 
salaries  wages  and benefits salaries  wages and employee benefits increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of total operating revenue  salaries  wages and employee benefits was during the year ended december  compared to in december  forward air salaries  wages and employee benefits of forward air increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  salaries  wages and employee benefits were of forward air s operating revenue for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the million increase in salaries  wages  and benefits was driven by increases in employee incentives  loss development reserves associated with workers compensation claims  health insurance claims and variable wages 
employee incentives increased million on achievement of quarterly and annual performance goals for the year ended december  workers compensation claims increased million on increases in loss development reserves associated with prior period claims 
health insurance claims increased million primarily as a result of a small number of individually large medical claims that reached our self insured limits during the year ended december  these increases were partially offset by a million reduction in share based compensation 
the decrease in share based compensation was mainly due to final vesting of our stock option awards partially offset by stock option grants to key employees 
the remaining million increase is associated with increased variable wages  primarily dock employees  which increased in conjunction with the increased business volumes discussed above 
fasi salaries  wages and employee benefits of fasi decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of fasi operating revenue  salaries  wages and benefits decreased to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  fasi salaries  wages and employee benefits are higher as a percentage of operating revenue than our forward air segment  as a larger percentage of the transportation services are performed by company employed drivers 
the decrease in salaries  wages and employee benefits as a percentage of revenue is attributable to reduced dock wages  company employed driver pay and reduced workers compensation and health insurance claims 
as noted above  to move fasi to a more variable cost structure  we are in the process of shifting  wherever feasible  from company employed drivers to owner operators 
as a result  we reduced pay to company employed drivers by as a percentage of revenue 
also  for the year ended december  we reduced our dock wages by as a percentage of revenue compared to the year ended december  the improvement in dock wages is largely the result of efficiencies gained by installing conveyor systems in our larger facilities and replacing contract labor with company employed dock personnel 
workers compensation claims and groups insurance also decreased approximately as a percentage of revenue on improved current year claim experience 
these decreases were partially offset by a increase in employee incentives and share based compensation 
employee incentives increased as a percentage of revenue due to certain terminals and employees reaching quarterly performance goals 
the increase in share based compensation is attributable to stock option awards to key fasi employees 
operating leases operating leases decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  operating leases  the largest component of which is facility rent  were of consolidated operating revenue for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  forward air operating leases decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  operating leases were of forward air s operating revenue for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  the decrease in operating leases is mostly attributable to a million decrease in office rent 
the decline in office rent was the result of completing our new regional hub in dallas fort worth at the beginning of the third quarter of in conjunction with the opening of this facility we were able to move out of the previously leased facilities and reduce operating lease expense 
this reduction has been partially offset by certain existing terminals being relocated to larger facilities 
fasi operating leases decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  operating leases were of fasi operating revenue for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  approximately million of the decrease was attributable to lower facility rent due to the consolidation of duplicate facilities after our acquisitions 
the remaining million decrease is the result of the turn in of previously leased or rented vehicles and trailers 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  depreciation and amortization was of consolidated operating revenue for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  forward air depreciation and amortization increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of forward air operating revenue was in the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  approximately million of the increase is attributable to new trailers purchased in the fourth quarter of and mid the remaining million increase is primarily the result of a full year of depreciation on our dallas fort worth regional hub net of allocations of depreciation expense for the facility s usage to fasi 
fasi depreciation and amortization increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of fasi operating revenue was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the million increase is largely attributable to an allocation of depreciation expense for fasi s proportionate usage of the dallas fort worth regional hub and depreciation on conveyor systems installed in certain terminals during insurance and claims insurance and claims expense decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  insurance and claims was of consolidated operating revenue during compared with in forward air forward air insurance and claims expense decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  insurance and claims as a percentage of forward air s operating revenue was in the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in insurance and claims is attributable to reduced premiums  vehicle accident claims and cargo claims  offset by increased legal and professional fees 
insurance premiums decreased million as a result of a decrease in insurance premiums compared to on renewed and renegotiated insurance plans and reductions of reserves for premium audits related to previous years 
reserves for current year vehicle accidents and cargo claims decreased million on improved claims experience 
these decreases were offset by a million increase in legal and professional fees primarily associated with the litigation of prior year accidents and claims 
fasi fasi insurance and claims increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of operating revenue  insurance and claims was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the million increase is primarily due to a reduction in of our loss development reserves for vehicle claims resulting from an actuarial analysis of our vehicle claims 
no similar reduction occurred in fuel expense fuel expense increased million  or  to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  fuel expense was of consolidated operating revenue for the year ended december  and forward air forward air fuel expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  fuel expense was of forward air s operating revenue for the years ended december  and the increase in total dollars is attributable to increased mileage activity as well as increased average fuel prices during the year end december  compared to the year ended december  fasi fasi fuel expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  fuel expenses were of fasi operating revenue during the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  fasi fuel expense is significantly higher as a percentage of operating revenue than forward air s fuel expense  as fasi utilizes a higher ratio of company employed drivers and company owned or leased vehicles in its operations than forward air 
the increase in fasi fuel expense was attributable to the increase in average fuel prices during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  net of reductions in miles driven by company owned units 
other operating expenses other operating expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  other operating expenses were of consolidated operating revenue for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  forward air forward air other operating expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  forward air other operating expenses were of operating revenue for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increase in other operating expenses in total dollars was attributable to increases in variable costs  such as dock supplies  vehicle maintenance and tolls  which increased as a result of the increased business volumes discussed previously 
these increases were partially offset by a million gain recognized on the termination of a capital lease for a building located near our columbus  ohio hub facility 
fasi fasi other operating expenses decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  fasi other operating expenses were of operating revenue for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the million decrease is attributable to reductions in vehicle maintenance  dock supplies and cost control efforts 
vehicle maintenance decreased million on reductions in leased and rented vehicles due to the turn in of leased and rented vehicles assumed with the acquisitions 
the fasi customer losses discussed above were largely responsible for a million decrease in dock supplies due to the discontinued customers packing requirements 
intercompany eliminations intercompany eliminations were million during the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the intercompany eliminations are for agent station services fasi provided to forward air during the year ended december  impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets was million during the year ended december  impairment of goodwill was of consolidated operating revenue for year ended december  there were no impairments to goodwill and other intangible assets in forward air impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets was million  or  of forward air s operating revenue  during the year ended december  during the year ended december   forward air recorded a non cash million charge to write off the net book value of certain truckload and cargo handling customer relationships that had been discontinued during forward air had no impairments to goodwill and other intangible assets in fasi during the first quarter of  we determined there were indicators of potential impairment of the goodwill assigned to the fasi segment 
this determination was made based on the continuing economic recession  declines in current market valuations and fasi operating losses in excess of expectations 
as a result  we performed an interim impairment test as of march  based on the results of the impairment test  we recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million related to the fasi segment during forward air solutions had no impairments to goodwill and other intangible assets in results from operations income from operations increased by million to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december  income from operations was of consolidated operating revenue for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  forward air income from operations increased by million to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december  forward air s income from operations was of operating revenue for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  the increase in income from operations was primarily the result of the increased revenues discussed above and the resulting positive leverage the additional revenues provide against the fixed costs of the forward air network 
fasi fasi loss from operations decreased by million  or  to a million loss from operations for the year ended december  from a loss from operations of million for the year ended december  fasi loss from operations was of operating revenue for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  the decrease in fasi s loss from operations was primarily driven by the million non cash  goodwill impairment charge incurred in the remaining decrease in fasi s loss from operations was attributable to the discontinuance of low yield business and continuing efforts to improve operating efficiencies and control variable and discretionary costs 
interest expense interest expense was million for the years ended december  and other income  net other  net was income of million for the years ended december  and provision for income taxes the combined federal and state effective tax rate for the year ended december  was compared to a rate of for the year ended december  the decrease in our effective tax rate is primarily attributable to the increase in our income before income taxes combined with a decrease in share based compensation on incentive stock options 
the share based compensation for incentive stock options is mostly not deductible for income tax reporting 
also  decreasing the provision for income taxes during was a million reduction in the valuation allowance associated with a decrease in fasi s net deferred tax assets 
during  we increased the valuation allowance on fasi s net deferred tax assets by million 
in addition  the provision for income taxes for the year ended december  was increased by a million reserve for a state income tax contingency

our airport to airport business is priced on a per pound basis and the average revenue per pound  excluding the impact of fuel surcharges and complete  decreased for the year ended december  versus the year ended december  tonnage that transited our network decreased by during the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  the decrease in tonnage was primarily driven by the impact of the economic recession and the resulting reduction in shipping activity 
average base revenue per pound decreased due to the continued shift in revenue mix to shorter distance and lower price per pound routes as well as increased pricing competition brought on by s difficult economic environment 
the remaining decrease in airport to airport revenue is the result of reduced net fuel surcharge revenue offset by increased revenue from our complete pick up and delivery service 
net fuel surcharge revenue decreased million during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  as a result of reduced average fuel prices as well as decreased overall business volumes 
partially offsetting these decreases was a million increase in complete revenue during the year ended december  compared to the increase in complete revenue is attributable to an increased frequency of airport to airport shippers opting to utilize our complete service 
logistics revenue  which is primarily tlx and priced on a per mile basis  decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  tlx revenue decreased million and year over year as tlx average revenue per mile decreased approximately in compared to while miles driven to support our tlx revenue remained consistent from to the decrease in average revenue per mile is mainly attributable to decreased fuel surcharges as a result of decreased fuel prices and reduced yields as a result of increased truckload price competition 
the remaining decrease in logistics revenue was primarily driven by a million  or  decrease in dedicated fleet services  and a million decrease in other non mileage based logistic revenues 
the decline in dedicated fleet services was attributable to loss of the primary customer 
the decrease in non mileage based services was in conjunction with the overall decline in tlx business volumes 
other revenue  which includes warehousing services and terminal handling  accounts for the final component of forward air operating revenue 
other revenue decreased million  or  to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  the decline in other revenue was primarily due to volume decreases in conjunction with the decline in our airport to airport business 
these declines were partially offset by increases in dedicated pick up and delivery services initiated during the fourth quarter of fasi fasi operating revenue increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in revenue is the result of additional activity from the pinch acquisition on march  and the service express acquisition on september  and new business wins which occurred throughout these increases were slightly offset by reduced fuel surcharge revenues as a result of declining fuel prices and reduced shipping volumes at pre acquisition terminals resulting from the economic recession experienced throughout intercompany eliminations intercompany eliminations decreased million  or  to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  the intercompany eliminations are the result of truckload and airport to airport services forward air provided to fasi 
fasi also provided cartage and station agent services to forward air 
the decrease in intercompany eliminations was the result of reduced forward air truckload services provided to fasi

the reduction in miles decreased purchased transportation by million while the increase in cost per mile increased purchased transportation million 
miles driven by our network of owner operators or third party transportation providers decreased in conjunction with the tonnage decline discussed above 
offsetting these decreases in airport to airport purchased transportation was a million increase in expenses for third party transportation costs associated with the increased customer utilization of complete 
purchased transportation costs for our logistics revenue decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   logistics purchased transportation costs represented of logistics revenue versus for the year ended december  the decrease in logistics purchased transportation was attributable to the million  or  decrease in tlx purchased transportation 
miles driven to support our tlx revenue remained consistent  decreasing less than  but we reduced the cost per mile by approximately during compared to the reduction in cost per mile was mostly attributable to the increased utilization of our less costly network of owner operators and improved purchasing power given the increased availability of third party transportation providers 
the remaining decrease in logistics purchased transportation was driven by a million decrease in transportation costs associated with dedicated fleet services 
logistics purchased transportation increased as a percentage of revenue primarily due to the decline in yield per mile resulting from lower fuel surcharges and increased truckload pricing competition 
during  these decreases reduced our tlx yield per mile at a faster rate than we can reduce the related cost per mile 
purchased transportation costs related to our other revenue decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  other purchased transportation costs as a percentage of other revenue decreased to of other revenue for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the improvement in other purchased transportation costs as a percentage of other revenue is attributable to the use of company employed drivers to provide the transportation services associated with certain dedicated pick up and delivery services initiated during the fourth quarter of further  due to the economic recession  we have ceased providing other ancillary services in circumstances in which the overall yield was insufficient 
fasi fasi purchased transportation increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  fasi purchased transportation as a percentage of revenue was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increase in purchased transportation is mainly due to our continued expansion of the fasi business through the acquisitions of pinch and service express in march and september  respectively 
the increase in purchased transportation as a percentage of revenue is attributable to increased utilization of owner operators and third party transportation providers as opposed to company employed drivers  thereby shifting the cost from salaries  wages and benefits to purchased transportation 
it is generally more cost effective to run an owner operator than a company employed driver  and we continue to recruit owner operators to use in our fasi operations 
intercompany eliminations intercompany eliminations decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the intercompany eliminations are the result of truckload and airport to airport services forward air provided to fasi during the year end december  fasi also provided cartage and agent station services to forward air 
the decrease in intercompany eliminations was the result of reduced forward air truckload services provided to fasi 
salaries  wages  and benefits salaries  wages and employee benefits decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of total operating revenue  salaries  wages and employee benefits was during compared to in forward air salaries  wages and employee benefits of forward air decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  salaries  wages and employee benefits were of forward air s operating revenue for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the million decrease in salaries  wages  and benefits was driven by our efforts to reduce personnel costs in conjunction with the overall decline in forward air revenue 
our efforts to reduce personnel costs focused largely on controlling airport to airport variable wages  such as dock personnel 
through these reductions we have reduced terminal related pay by approximately million  or 
in addition  we reduced personnel costs associated with our sales force and various back office functions by approximately million  or 
however  these decreases were partially offset by increases in workers compensation claims  share based compensation and employee incentives 
workers compensation claims increased million  or  largely driven by adjustments to our loss development reserves based on actuary analyses of forward air s worker compensation claims experience 
share based compensation increased million  or  due to the annual grants of stock options and non vested shares of common stock non vested shares to key members of management and non employee directors from to the present 
employee incentives increased million  or  for annual incentives for key employees and senior management 
during the fourth quarter of  salaries  wages and employee benefits increased by million as we increased incentive accruals for senior management and key employees 
comparatively  during the fourth quarter of  we decreased salaries  wages and employee benefits by million for incentives to key employees and senior management 
during  we were not able to reduce the fixed components of our salaries and benefits  such as management pay  share based compensation  and other related benefit costs at the same rate at which forward air revenue declined  and as a result salaries  wages  and benefits increased as a percentage of revenue 
fasi salaries  wages and employee benefits of fasi increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of fasi operating revenue  salaries  wages and benefits increased to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  fasi salaries  wages and employee benefits are higher as a percentage of operating revenue than our forward air segment  as a larger percentage of the transportation services are performed by company employed drivers 
the increase in salaries  wages and employee benefits as a percentage of revenue is attributable to increases in health insurance and workers compensation costs  which increased to of revenue during from in the increases in health insurance and workers compensation costs is the result of including a full year of claims associated with employees brought on with the pinch and service express acquisitions 
in addition  shared based compensation and employee incentives increased million  or increased as a percentage of revenue  largely driven by increased stock option awards to key fasi employees during operating leases operating leases increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  operating leases  the largest component of which is facility rent  were of consolidated operating revenue for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  forward air operating leases increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  operating leases were of forward air s operating revenue for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  the increase in operating leases in total dollars was attributable to a million  or  increase in facility rent expense associated with the assumption of additional facilities as a result of the pinch acquisition and the expansion of certain facilities 
the increase in facility rent was offset by a million  or  decrease in tractor leases 
the decrease in tractor leases was the result of a reduction in leased vehicles assumed in conjunction with the pinch acquisition as such leases expired 
fasi operating leases increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  operating leases were of fasi operating revenue for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  approximately million of the increase was attributable to higher facility rent expense due to the increased number of terminals resulting from the pinch and service express acquisitions 
operating leases also increased million for trailer  tractor  and straight truck leases assumed in conjunction with the acquisitions of pinch and service express 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  depreciation and amortization was of consolidated operating revenue for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  forward air depreciation and amortization increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of forward air operating revenue was in the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increase in depreciation and amortization expense is attributable to increased depreciation on our new regional hub facility  recent trailer purchases  terminal and facility leasehold improvements  and software and computer equipment 
trailer depreciation increased million due to new trailers placed in service during the fourth quarter of other depreciation increased million as a result of depreciation on our new regional hub in dallas fort worth  capital expenditures for improvements to other new or expanded facilities and for capital expenditures required to assimilate equipment  terminals and office facilities obtained through our recent acquisitions into our network 
fasi depreciation and amortization increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of fasi operating revenue was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  depreciation on tractors and trailers obtained in conjunction with our acquisitions of pinch and service express accounted for million of the increase in depreciation and amortization 
amortization of intangible assets also increased million due to intangible assets acquired with the pinch and service express acquisitions 
the remaining million increase was attributable to amortization of fastracs  our internally developed software utilized in fasi s operation  depreciation on terminal improvements such as conveyors  security systems and office improvements and depreciation on non rolling stock assets acquired with the pinch and service express acquisitions 
insurance and claims insurance and claims expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  insurance and claims was of consolidated operating revenue during compared with in forward air forward air insurance and claims expense increased million  or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  insurance and claims as a percentage of forward air operating revenue was in the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increase is the result of increases in our loss development reserves and the fees associated with investigation and defense of our vehicle liability 
adjustments to our loss development reserves for vehicle accidents increased by approximately million during the year ended december  compared to year ended december  these increases were based on actuarial analyses of forward air s vehicle accident claim experience performed during additionally  professional fees associated with investigation and defense of our vehicle liability increased million during compared to these increases were offset by a million and a million decrease in vehicle accident damages and cargo claims  respectively 
these decreases were the result of the reduced shipping activity discussed above 
fasi fasi insurance and claims increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of operating revenue  insurance and claims was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the million increase in insurance and claims is primarily attributable to a million increase in cargo claims and a million increase in insurance premiums and vehicle claims for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the increase in both is primarily attributable to the increased shipping activity and claims experience associated with our recent acquisitions 
fuel expense fuel expense decreased million  or  to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  fuel expense was of consolidated operating revenue for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  forward air forward air fuel expense decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  fuel expense was of forward air s operating revenue for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to the significant reduction in average fuel prices and the year over year decline in business volumes discussed above 
fasi fasi fuel expense decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  fuel expenses were of fasi operating revenue during the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  fasi fuel expense is significantly higher as a percentage of operating revenue than forward air s fuel expense  as fasi utilizes a higher ratio of company employed drivers and company owned or leased vehicles in its operations than forward air 
the decrease in fuel expense was primarily due to the significant reduction in average fuel prices during as compared to offset by increased activity as a result of the pinch and service express acquisitions 
other operating expenses other operating expenses decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  other operating expenses were of consolidated operating revenue for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  forward air forward air other operating expenses decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  forward air other operating expenses were of operating revenue for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increase as a percentage of revenue is the result of expenses not decreasing at the same rate as revenue 
volume related expenses such as tires  dock supplies  maintenance and agent station fees decreased million  or  in compared to however  these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in property and other taxes largely associated with our company owned terminals 
the million increase in property and other taxes is partially attributable to other operating expenses for including a million reduction related to the reversal of previous accruals for fines and penalties associated with the settlement of a dispute with a state taxing authority 
the dispute was settled with the state taxing authority during the third quarter of for less than the amount previously reserved 
fasi fasi other operating expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  fasi other operating expenses were of operating revenue for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increase is attributable to increased volume related expenses  such as dock supplies  tires  and vehicle maintenance 
the increase in the volume related expenses was directly related to the increased revenue activity associated with the acquisitions of pinch and service express 
the decrease as a percentage of revenue is attributable to the increase in revenue outpacing the increase in other operating expenses 
intercompany eliminations intercompany eliminations were million during the year ended december  the intercompany eliminations are for agent station services fasi provided to forward air during the year ended december  fasi did not provide agent station services to forward air during impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets was million during the year ended december  impairment of goodwill was of consolidated operating revenue for year ended december  forward air impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets was million  or  of forward air operating revenue  during the year ended december  during the year ended december   forward air recorded a million charge to write off the net book value of certain truckload and cargo handling customer relationships that had been discontinued during fasi during the first quarter of  we determined there were indicators of potential impairment of the goodwill assigned to the fasi segment 
this determination was made based on the continuing economic recession  declines in current market valuations and fasi operating losses in excess of expectations 
as a result  we performed an interim impairment test as of march  based on the results of the impairment test  we recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million related to the fasi segment during income from operations income from operations decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december  income from operations was of consolidated operating revenue for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  forward air income from operations decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december  forward air s income from operations was of operating revenue for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  the decrease in income from operations was primarily the result of the decreased transportation and net fuel surcharge revenues discussed above and our inability during to reduce expenses at the same pace as the decline in total revenues 
fasi fasi loss from operations increased approximately million to a million loss from operations for the year ended december  from a loss from operations of million for the year ended december  fasi loss from operations was of operating revenue for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  the increase in fasi s loss from operations was primarily driven by the million non cash  goodwill impairment charge 
also driving the increase in the operating loss was the lower than projected business volumes 
interest expense interest expense decreased approximately million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for year ended december  the decrease in interest expense was the result of the decline in the average interest rate on net borrowings of our senior credit facility 
other income  net other  net was income of million for the year ended december  compared with income of million for the year ended december  the decrease in other income was attributable to decreased average cash and investment balances as well as lower returns received on cash invested driven by the decline in short term interest rates 
provision for income taxes the combined federal and state effective tax rate for the year ended december  was compared to a rate of for the year ended december  the increase in our effective tax rate is primarily attributable to the decline in our income before income taxes combined with an increase in share based compensation on incentive stock options 
the share based compensation for incentive stock options is mostly not deductible for income tax reporting 
also  increasing the effective tax rate was the establishment of a million valuation allowance on fasi s net state deferred tax assets and a million reserve for a state income tax contingency 
the effective rate for the year ended december  was reduced by a million decrease in state income tax expense  net of federal benefit  for the settlement of a dispute with a state taxing authority 
the dispute was settled with the state taxing authority during the third quarter of for less than the amount previously reserved 
net income as a result of the foregoing factors  net income decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  discussion of critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
our estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and changes in the business environment 
however  actual results may differ from estimates under different conditions  sometimes materially 
critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require management s most subjective judgments 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances in which management is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us for example  bankruptcy filings or accounts turned over for collection or litigation  we record a specific reserve for these bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for these bad debts based on the length of time the receivables are past due 
specifically  amounts that are days or more past due are reserved at for forward air and for fasi 
if circumstances change ie  we experience higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  the estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be changed by a material amount 
accounts are written off after all means of collection  including legal action  have been exhausted 
allowance for revenue adjustments our allowance for revenue adjustments consists of amounts reserved for billing rate changes that are not captured upon load initiation 
these adjustments generally arise i when the sales department contemporaneously grants small rate changes spot quotes to customers that differ from the standard rates in the system  ii when freight requires dimensionalization or is reweighed resulting in a different required rate  iii when billing errors occur  and iv when data entry errors occur 
when appropriate  permanent rate changes are initiated and reflected in the system 
we monitor the manual revenue adjustments closely through the employment of various controls that are in place to ensure that revenue recognition is not compromised and that fraud does not occur 
during  average revenue adjustments per month were approximately million  on average revenue per month of approximately million less than of monthly revenue 
in order to estimate the allowance for revenue adjustments related to ending accounts receivable  we prepare an analysis that considers average monthly revenue adjustments and the average lag for identifying and quantifying these revenue adjustments 
based on this analysis  we establish an allowance for approximately days dependent upon experience in the preceding twelve months of average revenue adjustments  adjusted for rebates and billing errors 
the lag is periodically adjusted based on actual historical experience 
additionally  the average amount of revenue adjustments per month can vary in relation to the level of sales or based on other factors such as personnel issues that could result in excessive manual errors or in excessive spot quotes being granted 
both of these significant assumptions are continually evaluated for validity 
self insurance loss reserves given the nature of our operating environment  we are subject to vehicle and general liability  workers compensation and health insurance claims 
to mitigate a portion of these risks  we maintain insurance for individual vehicle and general liability claims exceeding million and workers compensation claims and health insurance claims exceeding approximately million  except in ohio  where we are a qualified self insured entity with an approximately million self insured retention 
the amount of self insurance loss reserves and loss adjustment expenses is determined based on an estimation process that uses information obtained from both company specific and industry data  as well as general economic information 
the estimation process for self insurance loss exposure requires management to continuously monitor and evaluate the life cycle of claims 
using data obtained from this monitoring and our assumptions about the emerging trends  management develops information about the size of ultimate claims based on its historical experience and other available market information 
the most significant assumptions used in the estimation process include determining the trend in loss costs  the expected consistency in the frequency and severity of claims incurred but not yet reported  changes in the timing of the reporting of losses from the loss date to the notification date  and expected costs to settle unpaid claims 
management also monitors the reasonableness of the judgments made in the prior year s estimation process referred to as a hindsight analysis and adjusts current year assumptions based on the hindsight analysis 
additionally  we utilize actuarial analysis to evaluate open vehicle liability and workers compensation claims and estimate the ongoing development exposure 
revenue recognition operating revenue and related costs are recognized as of the date shipments are completed 
the transportation rates we charge our customers consist of base transportation rates and fuel surcharge rates 
the revenues earned and related direct freight expenses incurred from our base transportation services are recognized on a gross basis in revenue and in purchased transportation 
transportation revenue is recognized on a gross basis as we are the primary obligor 
the fuel surcharges billed to customers and paid to owner operators and third party transportation providers are recorded on a net basis in revenue as we are not the primary obligor with regards to the fuel surcharges 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the liability method  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
also  we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
we recognize interest and penalties  if any  related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and operating expenses  respectively 
at december   we had state net operating loss carryforwards of million that will expire between and the use of these state net operating losses is limited to the future taxable income of separate legal entities 
based on expectations of future taxable income  management believes that it is more likely than not that the results of operations will not generate sufficient taxable income to realize the net operating loss benefits for million in state loss carryforwards 
as a result  a valuation allowance has been provided for million of the state loss carryforwards 
the valuation allowance on these certain state loss carryforwards was approximately million at december  and was unchanged during we have also established a valuation allowance of approximately million on the state portion of fasi s net deferred tax assets 
this valuation allowance was established based on expectations of future taxable income as management believes that it is more likely than not that the results of fasi operations will not generate sufficient taxable income to realize the state benefit of the net deferred tax assets 
due to a reduction in fasi net deferred tax assets  this valuation allowance was reduced from approximately million at december  valuation of goodwill we conduct an annual or more frequently if circumstances indicate possible impairment impairment test of goodwill for each reportable segment at june of each year 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test is the estimation of each reportable segment s fair value 
if step one indicates that impairment potentially exists  the second step is performed to measure the amount of the impairment  if any 
goodwill impairment exists when the calculated implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value 
changes in strategy or market conditions could significantly impact these fair value estimates and require adjustments to recorded asset balances 
we calculate the fair value of the applicable reportable segments  using a combination of discounted projected cash flows and market valuations as of the valuation date for comparable companies 
changes in strategy or market conditions could significantly impact the judgments and assumptions made in the fair value calculations and require adjustments to recorded asset balances 
the estimation of fair value related to the impairment test for goodwill is particularly sensitive to projected financial information used in the calculations 
our fair value calculations for goodwill are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy as defined in the fasb codification 
for example  during the first quarter of  we determined there were indicators of potential impairment of the goodwill assigned to the fasi segment 
this determination was based on the continuing economic recession  declines in current market valuations and fasi operating losses in excess of expectations 
as a result  we performed an interim impairment test in accordance with our accounting policy discussed above as of march  based on the results of the interim impairment test  we concluded that an impairment loss was probable and could be reasonably estimated 
consequently  we recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million related to the fasi segment during the first quarter of share based compensation our general practice has been to make a single annual grant to key employees and to generally make other grants only in connection with new employment or promotions 
in addition  we make annual grants to non employee directors in conjunction with their annual election to our board of directors or at the time of their appointment to the board of directors 
during the year ended december   we granted non vested shares to key employees  but returned to granting stock options during the year ended december  for non employee directors  we have granted non vested shares annually beginning in stock options typically expire seven years from the grant date and vest ratably over a three year period 
the share based compensation for stock options are recognized  net of estimated forfeitures  ratably over the requisite service period  or vesting period 
based on our historical experience  forfeitures are estimated 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the grant date fair value of options granted 
the following table contains the weighted average assumptions used to estimate the fair value of options granted 
these assumptions are highly subjective and changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate 
december  december  december  expected dividend yield expected stock price volatility weighted average risk free interest rate expected life of options years the fair value of non vested shares issued were estimated using the closing market prices for the business day of the grant 
the share based compensation for the non vested shares is recognized  net of estimated forfeitures  ratably over the requisite service period or vesting period 
forfeitures are estimated based on our historical experience  but will be adjusted for future changes in forfeiture experience 
under the espp  which has been approved by our shareholders  we are authorized to issue shares of common stock to our employees 
these shares may be issued at a price equal to of the lesser of the market value on the first day or the last day of each six month purchase period 
common stock purchases are paid for through periodic payroll deductions and or up to two large lump sum contributions 
we recognize share based compensation on the date of purchase based on the difference between the purchase date fair market value and the employee purchase price 
operating leases certain operating leases include rent increases during the initial lease term 
for these leases  we recognize the related rental expenses on a straight line basis over the term of the lease  which includes any rent holiday period  and records the difference between the amounts charged to operations and amount paid as rent as a rent liability 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life or the initial term of the lease 
impact of recent accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board the fasb expanded the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements 
the expanded disclosures will require a greater level of disaggregated information and additional disclosures about valuation techniques and inputs to fair value measurements 
the amendment will require expanded disclosures on transfers in and out of level and level fair values  activity in level investments and inputs and valuation techniques 
the new disclosure requirements and clarifications of existing disclosures are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the disclosure requirements involving activity in level fair value measurements 
those disclosure requirements are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
the adoption of the provisions of this amendment required in the first interim period after december  did not have a material impact on our financial statement disclosures 
in addition  the adoption of the provisions of this amendment required for periods beginning after december  is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statement disclosures 
in june  the fasb amended rules regarding the transfer and servicing of financial assets and the extinguishment of financial assets 
the amended guidance eliminates the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity qspe  clarifies and amends the derecognition criteria for a transfer to be accounted for as a sale  amends and clarifies the unit of account eligible for sale accounting  and requires that a transferor initially be measured at fair value and recognize all assets obtained for example beneficial interests and liabilities incurred as a result of a transfer of an entire financial asset or group of financial assets accounted for as a sale 
additionally  on and after the effective date of the amended guidance  existing qspes as defined under previous accounting standards must be evaluated for consolidation by reporting entities in accordance with the applicable consolidation guidance 
the amended guidance requires enhanced disclosures about  among other things  a transferor s continuing involvement with transfers of financial assets accounted for as sales  the risks inherent in the transferred financial assets that have been retained  and the nature and financial effect of restrictions on the transferor s assets that continue to be reported in the statement of financial position 
our adoption of the amended guidance on january   did not have a significant impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in june  the fasb amended its rules regarding the consolidation of variable interest entities vie 
the fasb also amended the guidance governing the determination of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a vie  and is  therefore  required to consolidate an entity  by requiring a qualitative analysis rather than a quantitative analysis 
the qualitative analysis will include  among other things  consideration of who has the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and who has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie 
this standard also requires continuous reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a vie 
previously  fasb rules required reconsideration of whether an enterprise was the primary beneficiary of a vie only when specific events had occurred 
qspes  which were previously exempt from the application of rules regarding vie  will be subject to the provisions of these new rules when they become effective 
the amended guidance also requires enhanced disclosures about an enterprise s involvement with a vie 
we adopted the amended guidance on january   and this adoption did not have a significant impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our working capital needs  including capital expenditures  with cash flows from operations and borrowings under our bank lines of credit 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled approximately million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million for the year ended december  the increase in cash provided by operating activities is mainly attributable to a million increase in net earnings after consideration of non cash items offset by a million reduction in cash provided by accounts receivable and a million increase in cash used to fund other assets 
the decrease in cash from accounts receivable is largely attributable to the increase in business volumes during the year ended december   resulting in revenues that will not be collected until early the increase in cash used to fund other assets is largely attributable to increased estimated income tax payments in conjunction with the increase in earnings before income taxes 
net cash used in investing activities was approximately million for the year ended december  compared with approximately million used in investing activities during the year ended december  investing activities during the year ended december  consisted primarily of capital expenditures for new tractors  trailers and vehicles to replace aging units 
the million of proceeds from disposal of property and equipment includes approximately million of cash received from a lessor as part of final settlement on the terminated capital lease discussed previously 
cash used for investing activities during the year ended december  included capital expenditures primarily for the dallas fort worth regional hub that was completed at the beginning of the third quarter of net cash used in financing activities totaled approximately million for the year ended december  compared with approximately million used in financing activities during the year ended december  cash used in financing activities for the years ended december  and mainly included our quarterly dividend payments and scheduled capital lease payments 
the reduction in cash used for financing activities is attributable to reduced capital lease and debt payments and increased proceeds from stock option exercises 
capital lease and debt payments decreased as certain capital leases and notes payable assumed with past acquisitions reached their scheduled maturity dates 
we currently have access to a million senior credit facility 
the facility expires in october and includes an accordion feature  which if approved by our lender  allows for an additional million in borrowings 
however  at this time we believe that to access the accordion feature our lender would require that the interest rates for the senior credit facility be reset to match current market rates 
interest rates for advances under the senior credit facility are at libor plus to based upon covenants related to total indebtedness to earnings 
at december   we had million of available borrowing capacity under the senior credit facility  not including the accordion feature  and had utilized million of availability for outstanding letters of credit 
on july   our board of directors approved an additional stock repurchase program for up to two million shares of our common stock the repurchase plan 
no shares were repurchased during the years ended december   and as of december    shares remained eligible for repurchase under the repurchase plan 
during each quarter of  and  cash dividends of per share were declared on common stock outstanding 
we expect to continue to pay regular quarterly cash dividends  though each subsequent quarterly dividend is subject to review and approval by our board of directors 
we believe that our available cash  investments  expected cash generated from future operations and borrowings under the available senior credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   we had letters of credit outstanding from banks totaling million required primarily by our workers compensation and vehicle liability insurance providers 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of december  in thousands are summarized below contractual obligations payment due period and total thereafter capital lease obligations equipment purchase commitments operating leases senior credit facility total contractual cash obligations not included in the above table are reserves for unrecognized tax benefits and for self insurance claims of million and million  respectively 
forward looking statements this report contains forward looking statements  as defined in section a of the securities act and section e of the exchange act 
forward looking statements are statements other than historical information or statements of current condition and relate to future events or our future financial performance 
some forward looking statements may be identified by use of such terms as believes  anticipates  intends  plans  estimates  projects or expects 
such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results  performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
the following is a list of factors  among others  that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward looking statements economic factors such as recessions  inflation  higher interest rates and downturns in customer business cycles  our inability to maintain our historical growth rate because of a decreased volume of freight moving through our network or decreased average revenue per pound of freight moving through our network  increasing competition and pricing pressure  surplus inventories  loss of a major customer  the creditworthiness of our customers and their ability to pay for services rendered  our ability to secure terminal facilities in desirable locations at reasonable rates  the inability of our information systems to handle an increased volume of freight moving through our network  changes in fuel prices  claims for property damage  personal injuries or workers compensation  employment matters including rising health care costs  enforcement of and changes in governmental regulations  environmental and tax matters  the handling of hazardous materials  the availability and compensation of qualified independent owner operators and freight handlers needed to serve our transportation needs and our inability to successfully integrate acquisitions

we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk relates principally to changes in interest rates and fuel prices 
our interest rate exposure relates principally to changes in interest rates for borrowings under our senior credit facility 
the senior credit facility  which represents an aggregate principal amount of million at december   bears interest at variable rates 
based on our outstanding borrowings at december   a hypothetical increase in our senior credit facility borrowing rate of basis points  or an increase in the total effective interest rate from to  would increase our annual interest expense by approximately million and would have decreased our annual cash flow from operations by approximately million 
under our senior credit facility our interest rate has been consistently below market rates and our interest rate risk is not considered material 
our only other debt is capital lease obligations totaling million 
these lease obligations all bear interest at a fixed rate 
accordingly  there is no exposure to market risk related to these capital lease obligations 
we are exposed to the effects of changes in the price and availability of diesel fuel  as more fully discussed in item a  risk factors 
our cash and cash equivalents are also subject to market risk  primarily interest rate and credit risk
