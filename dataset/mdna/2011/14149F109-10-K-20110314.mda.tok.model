in addition  our past results of operations do not necessarily indicate our future results 
in addition  this section should be read in conjunction with the description of our risk factors in item a above 
overview we are a financial holding company formed in and headquartered in fairfax county  virginia 
we were formed principally in response to opportunities resulting from the consolidation of several virginia based banks 
these bank consolidations were typically accompanied by the dissolution of local boards of directors and relocation or termination of management and customer service professionals and a general deterioration of personalized customer service 
we own cardinal bank the bank  a virginia state chartered community bank with banking offices located in northern virginia and the greater washington  dc metropolitan area 
the bank offers a wide range of traditional bank loan and deposit products and services to both our commercial and retail customers 
our commercial relationship managers focus on attracting small and medium sized businesses as well as government contractors  commercial real estate developers and builders and professionals  such as physicians  accountants and attorneys 
additionally  we complement our core banking operations by offering a wide range of services through our various subsidiaries  including mortgage banking through george mason mortgage  llc george mason and cardinal first mortgage  llc cardinal first  collectively the mortgage banking segment  retail securities brokerage though cardinal wealth services  inc cws  asset management through wilson bennett capital management  inc wilson bennett  and trust  estate  custody  investment management and retirement planning through the trust division of cardinal bank 

table of contents george mason  based in fairfax  virginia  engages primarily in the origination and acquisition of residential mortgages for sale into the secondary market on a best efforts basis through six branches located throughout the metropolitan washington  dc region 
george mason does business in eight states  primarily virginia and maryland  and the district of columbia 
george mason is one of the largest residential mortgage originators in the greater washington metropolitan area  generating originations of approximately billion and billion of loans in and  respectively  excluding advances on construction loans and including loans purchased from other mortgage banking companies which are owned by local home builders but managed by george mason the managed companies 
george mason primary sources of revenue include loan origination fees  net interest income earned on loans held for sale  gains on sales of loans and contractual management fees earned relating to services provided to other mortgage companies owned by local home builders 
at the time we enter into an interest rate lock arrangement with the borrower  we enter into a loan forward sale commitment with a third party 
our mortgage loans are then sold servicing released 
cardinal first originates mortgage loans for new homes and refinancing in virginia  maryland  and washington  dc principally for existing cardinal bank customers 
in addition  cardinal first offers a construction to permanent loan program 
this program provides variable rate financing for customers to construct their residences 
once the home has been completed  the loan converts to fixed rate financing and is sold into the secondary market 
these construction to permanent loans generate fee income as well as net interest income for cardinal first and are classified as loans held for sale 
the mortgage banking segment business is both cyclical and seasonal 
the cyclical nature of its business is influenced by  among other factors  the levels of and trends in mortgage interest rates  national and local economic conditions and consumer confidence in the economy 
historically  the mortgage banking segment has its lowest levels of quarterly loan closings during the first quarter of the year 
wilson bennett provides asset management services to certain of our customers 
wilson bennett uses a value oriented approach that focuses on large capitalization stocks 
wilson bennett primary source of revenue is management fees earned on the assets it manages for its customers 
these management fees are generally based upon the market value of managed and custodial assets and  accordingly  revenues from wilson bennett will be  assuming a consistent customer base  more when appropriate indices  such as the s p  are higher and lower when such indices are depressed 
in july  we formed a wholly owned subsidiary  cardinal statutory trust i  for the purpose of issuing million of floating rate junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures trust preferred securities 
these trust preferred securities are due in and pay interest at a rate equal to libor london interbank offered rate plus  which adjusts quarterly 
these securities are redeemable at par beginning september the interest rate on this debt was at december  we have guaranteed payment of these securities 
the million payable by us to cardinal statutory trust i is included in other borrowed funds in the consolidated statements of condition since cardinal statutory trust i is an unconsolidated subsidiary as we are not the primary beneficiary of this entity 
we utilized the proceeds from the issuance of the trust preferred securities to make a capital contribution into the bank 
net interest income is our primary source of revenue 
we define revenue as net interest income plus non interest income 
as discussed further in the interest rate sensitivity section  we manage our balance sheet and interest rate risk exposure to maximize  and concurrently stabilize  net interest income 
we do this by monitoring our liquidity position and the spread between the interest rates earned on interest earning assets and the interest rates paid on interest bearing liabilities 
we attempt to minimize our exposure to interest rate risk  but are unable to eliminate it entirely 
in addition to managing interest rate risk  we also analyze our loan portfolio for exposure to credit risk 
loan defaults and foreclosures are inherent risks in the banking industry  and we attempt to limit our exposure to 
table of contents these risks by carefully underwriting and then monitoring our extensions of credit 
in addition to net interest income  noninterest income is an important source of revenue for us and includes  among other things  service charges on deposits and loans  investment fee income  which includes trust revenues  gains and losses on sales of investment securities available for sale  gains on sales of mortgage loans  and management fee income 
net interest income and non interest income represented the following percentages of total revenue for the three years ended december  net interest income non interest income non interest income is a lower percentage of our total revenue in as compared to and as a result of the increase in our net interest income 
during  we managed our balance sheet growth and strategically decreased the interest rates we paid on our deposit liabilities in order improve our net interest margin 
economic environment the banking environment and the markets in which we conduct our businesses will continue to be strongly influenced by developments in the us and global economies  as well as the continued implementation and rulemaking from recent financial reforms 
the global economy continued to recover modestly during in the us  the economy began to recover early in  fueled by moderate growth in consumption and inventory rebuilding  but slowed in late spring  as the sovereign debt crisis in europe intensified 
a slowdown in consumption and domestic demand growth contributed to weak employment gains and an unemployment rate that drifted close to percent 
year over year inflation measures receded below one percent and stock market indices declined 
concerns about high unemployment and fears that us might incur deflation led the federal reserve to adopt a second round or quantitative easing that involved purchases of billion of us treasury securities scheduled to occur through june the announcement of this policy led to lower interest rates 
bond yields rebounded in the second half of as economic growth in the us accelerated  driven by stronger consumer spending  rapid growth of exports and business investment in equipment and software 
despite only moderate economic growth in  corporate profits rose sharply  benefiting from strong productivity gains and constraints on hiring and operating costs 
the housing market remained weak throughout home sales were soft  despite lower home prices and low interest rates 
there were delays in the foreclosure process on the large number of distressed mortgages and the supply of unsold homes remained high 
housing prices renewed a downward trend in the second half of  due in part to the expiration of tax incentives for home buyers 
despite the challenges in the national and global economies  the metropolitan washington  dc area  the region we operate in  performed relatively well as compared to other geographic regions 
the unemployment rate in the washington  dc metropolitan area did not increase to the same level as the national unemployment rate  and commercial and residential real estate values held up comparatively well to other geographic regions 
at december   we have non accrual loans totaling million and loans contractually past due days or more as to principal or interest of  annualized net charge offs were of our average loans receivable for the year ended december  due to historically low mortgage loan rates  originations from our mortgage banking segment for surpassed originations for 
table of contents as a result  net income from our mortgage banking segment increased to million for the year ended december  compared to net income of million for the year ended december  market illiquidity continues to impact certain portions of our investment securities portfolio  specifically the ratings of certain corporate bonds in our portfolio 
we hold investments of million in par value of pooled trust preferred securities  which are significantly below book value as of december  due to the lack of liquidity in the market and investor apprehension for investing in these types of investments 
we expect challenging economic and operating conditions and an evolving regulatory regime to continue for the foreseeable future 
these conditions could continue to affect the markets in which we do business and could adversely impact our results for the degree of the impact is dependent upon the duration and severity of the aforementioned conditions 
while our loan growth has continued to be strong  continued negative economic conditions could adversely affect our loan portfolio  including causing increases in delinquencies and default rates  which we expect could impact our charge offs and provision for loan losses 
deterioration in real estate values and household incomes could result in higher credit losses for us 
also  in the ordinary course of business  we may be subject to a concentration of credit risk to a particular industry  counterparty  borrower or issuer 
a deterioration in the financial condition or prospects of a particular industry or a failure or downgrade of  or default by  any particular entity or group of entities could negatively impact our businesses  perhaps materially 
the systems by which we set limits and monitor the level of our credit exposure to individual entities and industries also may not function as we have anticipated 
liquidity is essential to our business 
the primary sources of funding for our bank include customer deposits and wholesale funding 
our liquidity could be impaired by an inability to access the capital markets or by unforeseen outflows of cash  including deposits 
this situation may arise due to circumstances that we may be unable to control  such as general market disruption  negative views about the financial services industry generally  or an operational problem that affects a third party or us 
our ability to borrow from other financial institutions on favorable terms or at all could be adversely affected by further disruptions in the capital markets or other events 
while we believe we have a healthy liquidity position  any of the above factors could materially impact our liquidity position in the future 
the us government continues to enact legislation and develop various programs and initiatives designed to stabilize the housing markets and stimulate the economy 
in july  the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the financial reform act was signed into law 
we are unsure of the impact this legislation will have on our business  operations or our financial condition 
critical accounting policies general us generally accepted accounting principles are complex and require management to apply significant judgment to various accounting  reporting  and disclosure matters 
management must use assumptions  judgments  and estimates when applying these principles where precise measurements are not possible or practical 
these policies are critical because they are highly dependent upon subjective or complex judgments  assumptions and estimates 
changes in such judgments  assumptions and estimates may have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements 
actual results  in fact  could differ from initial estimates 
the accounting policies we view as critical are those relating to judgments  assumptions and estimates regarding the determination of the allowance for loan losses  the fair value measurements of 
table of contents certain assets and liabilities  accounting for economic hedging activities  accounting for impairment testing of goodwill  accounting for the impairment of amortizing intangible assets and other long lived assets  and the valuation of deferred tax assets 
allowance for loan losses we maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level that represents management best estimate of known and inherent losses in our loan portfolio 
both the amount of the provision expense and the level of the allowance for loan losses are impacted by many factors  including general and industry specific economic conditions  actual and expected credit losses  historical trends and specific conditions of individual borrowers 
unusual and infrequently occurring events  such as weather related disasters  may impact our assessment of possible credit losses 
as a part of our analysis  we use comparative peer group data and qualitative factors such as levels of and trends in delinquencies and non accrual loans  national and local economic trends and conditions and concentrations of loans exhibiting similar risk profiles to support our estimates 
for purposes of our analysis  we categorize our loans into one of five categories commercial and industrial  commercial real estate including construction  home equity lines of credit  residential mortgages  and consumer loans 
in the absence of meaningful historical loss factors  peer group loss factors are applied and are adjusted by the qualitative factors mentioned above 
the indicated loss factors resulting from this analysis are applied for each of the five categories of loans 
in addition  we individually assign loss factors to all loans that have been identified as having loss attributes  as indicated by deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower or a decline in underlying collateral value if the loan is collateral dependent 
since we have limited historical data on which to base loss factors for classified loans  we typically apply  in accordance with regulatory guidelines  a loss factor to loans classified as special mention  a loss factor to loans classified as substandard and a loss factor to loans classified as doubtful 
loans classified as loss loans are fully reserved or charged off 
in certain instances  we evaluate the impairment of certain loans on a loan by loan basis 
for these loans  we analyze the fair value of the collateral underlying the loan and consider estimated costs to sell the collateral on a discounted basis 
if the net collateral value is less than the loan balance including accrued interest and any unamortized premium or discount associated with the loan we recognize an impairment and establish a specific reserve for the impaired loan 
credit losses are an inherent part of our business and  although we believe the methodologies for determining the allowance for loan losses and the current level of the allowance are adequate  it is possible that there may be unidentified losses in the portfolio at any particular time that may become evident at a future date pursuant to additional internal analysis or regulatory comment 
additional provisions for such losses  if necessary  would be recorded in the commercial banking or mortgage banking segments  as appropriate  and would negatively impact earnings 
fair value measurements we determine the fair values of financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy  which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value 
the standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value 
our investment securities available for sale are recorded at fair value using reliable and unbiased evaluations by an industry wide valuation service 
this service uses evaluated pricing models that vary based on asset class and include available trade  bid  and other market information 
generally  the methodology includes broker quotes  proprietary models  vast descriptive terms and conditions databases  as well as extensive quality control programs 
for certain of our held to maturity investment securities where there is minimal observable trading activity  we use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate fair value based on internal calculations and compare our results to information provided by external pricing sources 
our interest rate swap derivatives are recorded at fair value using 
table of contents observable inputs from a national valuation service 
these inputs are applied to a third party industry wide valuation model 
we also fair value our interest rate lock commitments and forwards loan sales commitments 
the fair value of our interest rate lock commitments considers the expected premium discount to par and we apply certain fallout rates for those rate lock commitments for which we do not close a mortgage loan 
in addition  we calculate the effects of the changes in interest rates from the date of the commitment through loan origination  and then period end  using applicable published mortgage backed investment security prices 
the fair value of the forward sales contracts to investors considers the market price movement of the same type of security between the trade date and the balance sheet date 
at loan closing  the fair value of the interest rate lock commitment is included in the cost basis of loans held for sale  which are carried at the lower of cost or market value 
accounting for economic hedging activities we record all derivative instruments on the statement of condition at their fair values 
we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes 
for derivatives designated as hedges  we contemporaneously document the hedging relationship  including the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge  how effectiveness will be assessed at inception and at each reporting period and the method for measuring ineffectiveness 
we evaluate the effectiveness of these transactions at inception and on an ongoing basis 
ineffectiveness is recorded through earnings 
for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges  the fair value adjustment is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income  except for the ineffective portion which is recorded in earnings 
for derivatives designated as fair value hedges  the fair value adjustments for both the hedged item and the hedging instrument are recorded through the income statement with any difference considered the ineffective portion of the hedge 
we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively when it is determined that the derivative is no longer highly effective 
in situations in which cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued  we continue to carry the derivative at its fair value on the statement of condition and recognize any subsequent changes in fair value in earnings over the term of the forecasted transaction 
when hedge accounting is discontinued because it is probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur  we recognize immediately in earnings any gains and losses that were accumulated in other comprehensive income 
in the normal course of business  we enter into contractual commitments  including rate lock commitments  to finance residential mortgage loans 
these commitments  which contain fixed expiration dates  offer the borrower an interest rate guarantee provided the loan meets underwriting guidelines and closes within the timeframe established by us 
interest rate risk arises on these commitments and subsequently closed loans if interest rates change between the time of the interest rate lock and the delivery of the loan to the investor 
loan commitments related to residential mortgage loans intended to be sold are considered derivatives and are marked to market through earnings 
to mitigate the effect of interest rate risk inherent in providing rate lock commitments  we economically hedge our commitments by entering into best efforts delivery forward loan sales contracts 
during the rate lock commitment period  these forward loan sales contracts are marked to market through earnings and are not designated as accounting hedges 
the changes in fair value related to movements in market rates of the rate lock commitments and the forward loan sales contracts generally move in opposite directions  and the net impact of changes in these valuations on net income during the loan commitment period is generally inconsequential 
at the closing of the loan  the loan commitment derivative expires and we record a loan held for sale and continue to be obligated under the same forward loan sales contract 
the forward sales contract is then designated as a hedge against the variability in cash to be received from the loan sale 
loans held for sale are accounted for at the lower of cost or fair value 

table of contents accounting for impairment testing of goodwill to test goodwill for impairment  we perform an analysis to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned to the carrying value of the reporting unit 
we make estimates of the discounted cash flows from the expected future operations of the reporting unit 
this discounted cash flow analysis involves the use of unobservable inputs including estimated future cash flows from operations  an estimate of a terminal value  a discount rate  and other inputs 
our estimated future cash flows are largely based on our historical actual cash flows 
if the analysis indicates that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  we do an analysis to compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all its assets and liabilities 
if the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized 
accounting for the impairment of amortizing intangible assets and other long lived assets we continually review our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the remaining estimated useful life of such assets might warrant revision or that the balances may not be recoverable 
we evaluate possible impairment by comparing estimated future cash flows  before interest expense and on an undiscounted basis  with the net book value of long term assets  including amortizable intangible assets 
if undiscounted cash flows are insufficient to recover assets  further analysis is performed in order to determine the amount of the impairment 
an impairment loss is recorded for the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their fair values 
fair value is usually determined based on the present value of estimated expected future cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risks involved 
valuation of deferred tax assets we record a provision for income tax expense based on the amounts of current taxes payable or refundable and the change in net deferred tax assets or liabilities during the year 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of differing carrying values of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement purposes that will reverse in future periods 
when substantial uncertainty exists concerning the recoverability of a deferred tax asset  the carrying value of the asset is reduced by a valuation allowance 
the amount of any valuation allowance established is based upon an estimate of the deferred tax asset that is more likely than not to be recovered 
increases or decreases in the valuation allowance result in increases or decreases to the provision for income taxes

financial overview the year ended december  was our second consecutive year of record profitability for us 
for the year  we reported net income of million on a consolidated basis 
the bank recorded net income of million and our mortgage banking operations recorded net income of million 
the wealth management and trust services business segment reported a net loss of million for the year ended december   which was mostly attributable to a noncash goodwill and other intangibles impairment charge of million 
for the year ended december   we reported net income of million 
the bank recorded net income of million and our mortgage banking operations recorded net income of million

provision for loan losses increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period of non interest income increased million to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the same period of due primarily to increases in realized and unrealized gains on sales of loans and management fee income from our mortgage banking subsidiaries 
noninterest expense was million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in noninterest expense was primarily related to increases in salaries and benefits expense and a noncash impairment charge of goodwill and other intangible assets of million in our wealth management and trust services segment 
the return on average assets for the years ended december  and was and  respectively 
the return on average equity for the years ended december  and was and  respectively 
our results of operations for the year ended december  were adversely impacted by two noncash impairment charges 
historically  we had three reporting units with associated goodwill wilson bennett  the trust division and george mason mortgage 
over time  the people and processes associated with the wilson bennett and trust division reporting units were assimilated to the point where the same group of employees were performing services for both subsidiaries  the subsidiaries had common customers clients  and  strategic and resource allocation decisions contemplated for the reporting units as if they were combined 
our annual assessment period for the goodwill associated with our wilson bennett reporting unit was the second calendar quarter 
commencing on july   we made the decision to combine the wilson bennett and trust division reporting units 
we performed the annual wilson bennett goodwill recoverability assessment in the second quarter and prior to the combination of the reporting units  and recognized an impairment loss of  during the fourth quarter of  we were notified by a large trust customer that it would solicit bids from other trust services providers 
we were also notified that an institutional wealth management customer was also closing its account 
because of the uncertainty surrounding these events  we performed an updated analysis of the recoverability of the goodwill and intangible assets associated with this now combined reporting unit 
while we were successful in retaining the large trust client  the projected reduction in net cash flows indicated that the goodwill and other intangible assets were impaired resulting in the write off of approximately million in goodwill and  in unamortized intangible assets 
no goodwill or intangible assets remain on the balance sheet associated with this reporting unit as of december  management continues to evaluate various operating strategies with respect to this reporting unit

our operating results for the year ended december  were adversely impacted by several events 
these events are discussed in detail below during the third quarter of  we performed our annual evaluation of the goodwill associated with our acquisition of george mason 
goodwill of million was recognized as a result of this acquisition 
we employed the services of a valuation consultant to assist us with the goodwill evaluation 
the analysis included certain valuation techniques  including a discounted cash flow approach 
following the acquisition  george mason delivered excellent financial results and returns on our investment 
recent and ongoing challenges in the regional residential real estate market negatively impacted the cash flows expected to be generated by george mason in the near term 
the valuation analysis indicated that the goodwill was impaired and we recorded a noncash impairment charge of million in the mortgage banking segment 
during the third quarter of  we recognized an other than temporary impairment charge of million on our investment in fannie mae perpetual preferred stock 
this impairment charge was recorded in the commercial banking segment 

table of contents during the second quarter of  george mason recorded a cash settlement to one of its mortgage correspondents related to the loan purchase agreement between the two parties 
this settlement agreement provided for the release of known and unknown claims by the mortgage correspondent in exchange for a million payment to the correspondent 
george mason also entered into similar agreements with certain third party mortgage companies from which george mason purchased mortgage loans and subsequently sold to this mortgage correspondent 
these settlement agreements provided for a total payment of million to george mason by those third party mortgage companies 
efficiency ratio the efficiency ratio measures the costs expended to generate a dollar of revenue 
it represents noninterest expense as a percentage of net interest income and noninterest income 
the lower the percentage  the more efficient we are operating 
we believe use of the efficiency ratio  excluding nonrecurring expenses  which is a non gaap financial measure  provides additional clarity in assessing our operating results

the level of net interest income is affected primarily by variations in the volume and mix of these assets and liabilities  as well as changes in interest rates 
during  the federal reserve began easing the federal funds rate due to worsening economic conditions related to the tightening credit markets and decreased the rate four times to end at at december  this easing continued into  and as the economy continued to slow and go into a recessionary phase  the federal reserve continued to decrease the fed funds rate to ultimately as of december  where it has remained during all of and see interest rate sensitivity for further information

table of contents our net interest margin  on a tax equivalent basis  for the years ended december  and was and  respectively  the increase for which was primarily a result of our ability to decrease interest rates on deposits faster as we managed our balance sheet in order to increase our yields on our interest earning assets 
we believe this financial measure provides a more accurate picture of the interest margin for comparative purposes 
to derive our net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis  net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax exempt income on an equivalent before tax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax expense 
for purposes of this calculation  we use our federal statutory tax rates for the periods presented 
this measure ensures comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax exempt sources

offsetting this increase was a decrease in average statement savings of million to million for compared to million for interest rate sensitivity we are exposed to various business risks including interest rate risk 
our goal is to maximize net interest income without incurring excessive interest rate risk 
management of net interest income and interest rate risk must be consistent with the level of capital and liquidity that we maintain 
we manage interest rate risk through an asset and liability committee alco 
alco is responsible for managing our interest rate risk in conjunction with liquidity and capital management 
we employ an independent consulting firm to model our interest rate sensitivity 
we use a net interest income simulation model as our primary tool to measure interest rate sensitivity 
many assumptions are developed based on expected activity in the balance sheet 
for maturing assets  assumptions are created for the redeployment of these assets 
for maturing liabilities  assumptions are developed for the replacement of these funding sources 
assumptions are also developed for assets and liabilities that could reprice during the modeled time period 
these assumptions also cover how we expect rates to change on non maturity deposits such as interest checking  money market checking  savings accounts as well as certificates of deposit 
based on inputs that include the current balance sheet  the current level of interest rates and the developed assumptions  the model then produces an expected level of net interest income assuming that market rates remain unchanged 
this is considered the base case 
next  the model determines what net interest income would be based on specific changes in interest rates 
the rate simulations are performed for a two year period and include ramped rate changes of down basis points and up basis points 
the down basis point scenario was discontinued given the current level of interest rates 
in the ramped down rate change  the model moves rates gradually down basis points over the first year and then rates remain flat in the second year 

table of contents for the up basis point scenario  rates are gradually moved up basis points in the first year and then rates remain flat in the second year 
in both the up and down scenarios  the model assumes a parallel shift in the yield curve 
the results of these simulations are then compared to the base case 
at december   our asset liability position was neutral based on our interest rate sensitivity model 
our net interest income would decrease by less than in a down basis point scenario and would increase less than in an up basis point scenario over a one year time frame 
in the two year time horizon  our net interest income would decrease by less than in a down basis point scenario and would increase by less than in an up basis point scenario 
provision expense and allowance for loan losses our policy is to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level that represents our best estimate of known and inherent losses in the loan portfolio 
both the amount of the provision and the level of the allowance for loan losses are impacted by many factors  including general and industry specific economic conditions  actual and expected credit losses  historical trends and specific conditions of individual borrowers 
the provision for loan losses was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the allowance for loan losses at december  was million compared to million at december  our allowance for loan loss ratio at december  was compared to at december  the increase in the allowance for loan loss ratio is a direct result of increases in non performing loans and the adverse migration of certain loans through our allowance for loan losses calculation model because of current and ongoing adverse economic conditions 
while we continue to report strong credit quality in our loan portfolio  we have experienced increases in our watch list credits and net charge offs 
our provision was impacted by net new loan growth in addition to our evaluation of the credit quality in our loan portfolio and the qualitative factors we use to determine the adequacy of our loan loss reserves 
we recorded net loan charge offs of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
during  we charged off million in commercial and industrial loans  residential loans of million and consumer loans of  annualized net charged off loans was of average loans receivable for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  non accrual loans totaled million at december  compared to  at december  continued challenging economic conditions could adversely affect our home equity lines of credit  credit card and other loan portfolios  including causing increases in delinquencies and default rates  which we expect could impact our charge offs and provision for loan losses 
continued deterioration in commercial and residential real estate values  employment data and household incomes could result in higher credit losses for us 
also  in the ordinary course of business  we may also be subject to a concentration of credit risk to a particular industry  counterparty  borrower or issuer 
at december   our commercial real estate including construction lending portfolio was of our total loan portfolio 
a deterioration in the financial condition or prospects of a particular industry or a failure or downgrade of  or default by  any particular entity or group of entities could negatively impact our businesses  perhaps materially  and the systems by which we set limits and monitor the level or our credit exposure to individual entities and industries  may not function as we have anticipated 
the provision for loan losses was million for net charge offs for the year ended december  was million

non interest income for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
the increase in non interest income for the year ended december   compared to the same period of  is primarily the result of an increase in realized and unrealized gains on mortgage banking activities and management fee income from our mortgage banking segment 
realized and unrealized gains on mortgage banking activities increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the increase in realized and unrealized gains on mortgage banking activities is directly related to an increase in loan origination and sales volume occurring in the mortgage banking segment as a result of decreased in mortgage rates and more affordable home prices during in addition  we have added mortgage loan originators during to help increase our market share 
included in realized and unrealized gains on mortgage banking activities are any origination  underwriting  and discount points and other funding fees and gains associated with our sales of loans to third party investors 
costs include direct costs associated with loan origination  such as commissions and salaries 
management fee income  which represents the income earned for services george mason provides to other mortgage companies owned by local home builders and generally fluctuates based on the volume of loan sales  increased million to million during as compared to million in  again due to the origination volumes in the residential real estate market 

table of contents another contributing factor to the increase in our non interest income was an increase in investment fee income  which increased  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for investment fee income includes net commissions earned at cws and income earned at wilson bennett and from our trust division 
the increase in the market values of managed and custodial assets and an increase in customer relationships in the wealth management and trust services segment have contributed to the increase in investment fee income during as previously mentioned  we recently completed negotiations of our service agreement with one of our largest wealth management clients 
while we were successful in retaining this client  in order to remain competitive in the negotiations process  we had to significantly decrease the fees we charge for our services to this particular client 
as a result  we anticipate fee income from this business line will decrease during service charges on deposit accounts decreased  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  service charges on deposit accounts include insufficient funds fee income  service charges on deposit accounts  other fee income on deposit accounts and atm transaction fees as shown in table loan service charges totaled million for the year ended december   a decrease of  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in loan service charges is primarily a result of a decrease in fee income earned by george mason title company during for the year ended december   the increase in the cash surrender value of our bank owned life insurance was  an increase of  when compared to the same period of this increase is a result of the increase in the earnings of the underlying investment assets of our bank owned life insurance 
for the year ended december   we recorded net gains on the sales of investment securities totaling  compared to  for the same period of in addition  we recorded trading gains of  for the year ended december   compared to trading losses of  for the year ended december  we have purchased investments to economically hedge against fair value changes of our nonqualified deferred compensation plan liability 
these investments are designated as trading securities  and as such  the changes in fair value are reflected in earnings 
these trading gains were primarily the result of increased stock prices and were mostly offset by a compensation expense associated with this benefit plan 
non interest income for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
the increase in non interest income for the year ended december   compared to the same period of  is primarily the result of an increase in realized and unrealized gains on mortgage banking activities and management fee income from our mortgage banking segment 
realized and unrealized gains on mortgage banking activities increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the increase in realized and unrealized gains on mortgage banking activities is directly related to an increase in loan origination and sales volume occurring in the mortgage banking segment as a result of decreased in mortgage rates and more affordable home prices during management fee income increased million to million during as compared to  in  again due to the origination volumes in the residential real estate market 
another contributing factor to the increase in our non interest income was an increase in loan service charges of million for the year ended december  to million  compared to million for the same period of the increase in loan service charges is primarily a result of fee income earned by george mason title company and again a result of an increase in loan origination and sales activity 
total investment fee income increased  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the increase in the market values 
table of contents of managed and custodial assets and an increase in customer relationships in the wealth management and trust services segment have contributed to the increase in investment fee income during service charges on deposit accounts decreased  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   the increase in the cash surrender value of our bank owned life insurance was  a decrease of  when compared to the same period of this decrease is a result of the decrease in the earnings of the underlying investment assets of our bank owned life insurance 
for the year ended december   we recorded net gains on the sales of investment securities totaling  compared to  for the same period of included in our net gains on investment securities available for sale were losses totaling  which were related to our sale of all of our shares of fannie mae perpetual preferred stock during the first quarter of we elected to sell these shares as a result of these shares being traded well below their par value following the placement of fannie mae into conservatorship by federal regulators during in addition  we recorded trading losses of  for the year ended december  these trading losses were primarily the result of lower stock prices and were partially offset by a reduction in our compensation expense associated with this benefit plan 
for the year ended december  gains related to the extinguishment of four borrowings totaling  one provision of the financial reform act requires the federal reserve to set a cap on debit card interchange fees charged to retailers 
in december  the federal reserve proposed capping the fee at cents per debit card transaction  which is well below the average that banks currently charge 
while banks with less than billion in assets such as the bank are exempted from this measure  as a practical matter we expect that  if this measure is implemented  all banks could be forced by market pressures to lower their interchange fees or face potential rejection of their cards by retailers 
as a result  we believe that our debit card revenue could be adversely impacted as soon as the third quarter of if the interchange cap is implemented

the increase in non accrual loans from december  is primarily a result of the continued deterioration in commercial and residential real estate markets  as all of our non accrual loans are collateralized by real estate 
there were no loans at december  and december  that were troubled debt restructurings 
interest income on non accrual loans  if recognized  is recorded when cash is received 
when a loan is placed on non accrual  unpaid interest is reversed against interest income if it was accrued in the current year and is charged to the allowance for loan losses if it was accrued in prior years

investment securities our investment securities portfolio is used as a source of income and liquidity 
the investment portfolio consists of investment securities available for sale  investment securities held to maturity and trading securities 
investment securities available for sale are those securities that we intend to hold for an indefinite period of time  but not necessarily until maturity 
these securities are carried at fair value and may be sold as part of an asset liability strategy  liquidity management or regulatory capital management 
investment securities held to maturity are those securities that we have the intent and ability to hold to maturity and are carried at amortized cost 
investment securities trading are securities we purchase to economically hedge against fair value changes of our nonqualified deferred compensation plan liability 
these securities include cash equivalents  equities and mutual funds 
see note to our notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on our trading securities 
investment securities were million at december   a decrease of million or  from million in investment securities at december  at december   the yield on the available for sale investment portfolio was and the yield on the held to maturity portfolio was 
we complete reviews for other than temporary impairment at least quarterly 
as of december   the majority of the investment securities portfolio consisted of securities rated aaa by a leading rating agency 
investment securities which carry a aaa rating are judged to be of the best quality and carry the smallest degree of investment risk 
at december   of our mortgage backed securities are guaranteed by the federal national association fnma  the federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc and the government national mortgage association gnma 
we have million in non government non agency mortgage backed securities 
these securities are rated from aaa to aa 
the various protective elements on the non agency securities may change in the future if market conditions or the financial stability of credit insurers changes  which could impact the ratings of these securities 

table of contents at december   certain of our investment grade securities were in an unrealized loss position 
investment securities with unrealized losses are a result of pricing changes due to recent and negative conditions in the current market environment and not as a result of permanent credit impairment 
contractual cash flows for the agency mortgage backed securities are guaranteed and or funded by the us government 
other mortgage backed securities and municipal securities have third party protective elements and there are no negative indications that the contractual cash flows will not be received when due 
we do not intend to sell nor do we believe it is probable that we will be required to sell any of our temporarily impaired securities prior to the recovery of the amortized cost 
the held to maturity portfolio includes investments in four pooled trust preferred securities  totaling million of par value at december  each security has a par value of million 
these securities are presented as corporate bonds in the table below 
the collateral underlying these structured securities are instruments issued by financial institutions or insurers 
we own the a tranches in each issuance 
each of the bonds is rated by more than one rating agency 
two of the securities have a composite rating of aa  one of the securities has a composite rating of bb and the other security has a composite rating of b 
there is minimal observable trading activity for these types of securities 
we have estimated the fair value of the securities through the use of internal calculations and through information provided by external pricing services 
given the level of subordination below the a tranches  and the actual and expected performance of the underlying collateral  we expect to receive all contractual interest and principal payments recovering the amortized cost basis of each of the four securities  and concluded that these securities are not other than temporarily impaired 
we continuously monitor the financial condition of the underlying issues and the level of subordination below the a tranches 
we also utilize a multi scenario model which assumes varying levels of additional defaults and deferrals and the effects of such adverse developments on the contractual cash flows for the a tranches 
in each of the adverse scenarios  there was no indication of a break to the a contractual cash flows 
significant judgment is involved in the evaluation of other than temporary impairment

we recorded no other than temporary impairments during and capital resources capital adequacy is an important measure of financial stability and performance 
our objectives are to maintain a level of capitalization that is sufficient to sustain asset growth and promote depositor and investor confidence 
regulatory agencies measure capital adequacy utilizing a formula that takes into account the individual risk profile of a financial institution 
the guidelines define capital as both tier which includes common shareholders equity  defined to include certain debt obligations and tier to include certain other debt obligations and a portion of the allowance for loan losses and of unrealized gains in equity securities

table of contents liquidity liquidity in the banking industry is defined as the ability to meet the demand for funds of both depositors and borrowers 
we must be able to meet these needs by obtaining funding from depositors or other lenders or by converting non cash items into cash 
the objective of our liquidity management program is to ensure that we always have sufficient resources to meet the demands of our depositors and borrowers 
stable core deposits and a strong capital position provide the base for our liquidity position 
we believe we have demonstrated our ability to attract deposits because of our convenient branch locations  personal service and pricing 
in addition to deposits  we have access to the different wholesale funding markets 
these markets include the brokered cd market  the repurchase agreement market and the federal funds market 
during  we joined the certificates of deposit account registry services cdars 
cdars allows our customers to access fdic insurance protection on multi million dollar certificates of deposit through our bank 
when a customer places a large deposit through cdars  we place their funds into certificates of deposit with other banks in the cdars network in increments of less than  so that principal and interest are eligible for fdic insurance protection 
we also maintain secured lines of credit with the federal reserve bank of richmond and the federal home loan bank of atlanta 
having diverse funding alternatives reduces our reliance on any one source for funding 
cash flow from amortizing assets or maturing assets can also provide funding to meet the needs of depositors and borrowers 
we have established a formal liquidity contingency plan which establishes a liquidity management team and provides guidelines for liquidity management 
for our liquidity management program  we first determine our current liquidity position and then forecast liquidity based on anticipated changes in the balance sheet 
in this forecast  we expect to maintain a liquidity cushion 
we also stress test our liquidity position under several different stress scenarios 
guidelines for the forecasted liquidity cushion and for liquidity cushions for each stress scenario have been established 
in addition  one stress test combines all other stress tests to see how liquidity would react to several negative scenarios occurring at the same time 
we believe that we have sufficient resources to meet our liquidity needs 
liquid assets  which include cash and due from banks  federal funds sold and investment securities available for sale  totaled million at december   or of total assets 
we held investments that are classified as held to maturity in the amount of million at december  to maintain ready access to the bank secured lines of credit  the bank has pledged roughly half of its investment securities and a portion of its residential real estate loan portfolio to the federal home loan bank of atlanta with additional investment securities and certain loans in its commercial real estate and commercial industrial loan portfolios pledged to the federal reserve bank of richmond 
additional borrowing capacity at the federal home loan bank of atlanta at december  was approximately million 
borrowing capacity with the federal reserve bank of richmond was approximately million at december  these facilities are subject to the fhlb and the federal reserve approving disbursement to us 
in addition  we have unsecured federal funds purchased lines of million available to us 
we anticipate maintaining liquidity at a level sufficient to protect depositors  provide for reasonable growth and fully comply with all regulatory requirements 
contractual obligations we have entered into a number of long term contractual obligations to support our ongoing activities 
these contractual obligations will be funded through operating revenues and liquidity sources 
table of contents held or available to us 
the required payments under such obligations excluding interest were as follows table contractual obligations at december  in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations certificates of deposit brokered certificates of deposit advances from the federal home loan bank of atlanta trust preferred securities operating lease obligations total financial instruments with off balance sheet risk and credit risk we are a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
those instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet 
unfunded commitments under lines of credit are commitments for possible future extensions of credit to existing customers 
those lines of credit may not be drawn upon to the total extent to which we have committed 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments we issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements  including commercial paper  bond financing  and similar transactions 
the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers 
we hold certificates of deposit  deposit accounts  and real estate as collateral supporting those commitments for which collateral is deemed necessary 
the bank maximum exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments 
the bank uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
a summary of the contract amount of the bank exposure to off balance sheet risk as of december  and  is as follows in thousands financial instruments whose contract amounts represent potential credit risk commitments to extend credit standby letters of credit 
table of contents commitments to extend credit of million as of december  were related to george mason mortgage loan funding commitments and were of a short term nature 
commitments to extend credit of million primarily have floating rates as of december  it is uncertain as to the amount that we will be required to fund on these commitments as many such arrangements expire with no amount drawn 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates up to one year or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
these instruments represent obligations to extend credit or guarantee borrowings and are not recorded on the consolidated statements of financial condition 
the rates and terms of these instruments are competitive with others in the market in which we do business 
we use the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as we do for on balance sheet instruments 
we evaluate each customer credit worthiness on a case by case basis and require collateral to support financial instruments when deemed necessary 
the amount of collateral obtained upon extension of credit is based on management evaluation of the counterparty 
collateral held varies but may include deposits held by us  marketable securities  accounts receivable  inventory  property  plant and equipment  and income producing commercial properties 
we have counter party risk which may arise from the possible inability of george mason third party investors to meet the terms of their forward sales contracts 
george mason works with third party investors that are generally well capitalized  are investment grade and exhibit strong financial performance to mitigate this risk 
we do not expect any third party investor to fail to meet its obligation 
in addition  we have derivative counterparty risk relating to three interest rate swaps we have with third parties 
this risk may arise from the inability of the third party to meet the terms of the contract 
we continuously monitor the financial condition of these third parties 
we do not expect these third parties to fail to meet their obligations 
george mason provides for its estimated exposure to repurchase loans previously sold to investors for which borrowers failed to provide full and accurate information on their loan application or for which appraisals have not been acceptable or when the loan was not underwritten in accordance with the loan program specified by the loan investor  and for other exposure to its investors related to loan sales activities 
we evaluate the merits of each claim and estimate the reserve based on actual and expected claims received and consider the historical amounts paid to settle such claims 
during the past two years  we have taken steps to limit our exposure to such loan repurchases through agreements entered into with various investors 
during  we experienced favorable results in resolving various investor claims and have reduced our reserve related to such claims 
at december   we had no outstanding loan repurchases or settlements 
during and  george mason either repurchased from or settled with investors on such loans for a total of million and million  respectively 
at december  and  the reserve for unresolved claims was and million  respectively

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our asset liability committee is responsible for reviewing our liquidity requirements and maximizing our net interest income consistent with capital requirements  liquidity  interest rate and economic outlooks  competitive factors and customer needs 
interest rate risk arises because the assets of the bank and the liabilities of the bank have different maturities and characteristics 
in order to measure this interest rate risk  we use a simulation process that measures the impact of changing interest rates on net interest income 
this model is run for the bank by an independent consulting firm 
the simulations incorporate assumptions related to expected activity in the balance sheet 
for maturing assets  assumptions are developed for the redeployment of these assets 
for maturing liabilities  assumptions are developed for the replacement of these funding sources 
assumptions are also developed for assets and liabilities that reprice during the modeled time period 
these assumptions also cover how we expect rates to change on non maturity deposits such as interest checking  money market checking  savings accounts as well as certificates of deposit 
based on inputs that include the most recent period end balance sheet  the current level of interest rates and the developed assumptions  the model then produces an expected level of net interest income assuming that interest rates remain unchanged 
this becomes the base case 
next  the model determines what net interest income would be based on specific changes in interest rates 
the rate simulations are performed for a two year period and include ramped rate changes of down basis points and up basis points 
the down basis point scenario was discontinued given the current level of interest rates 
in the ramped down rate change  the model moves rates gradually down basis points over the first year and then rates remain flat in the second year 
for the up basis point scenario  rates are gradually moved up basis points in the first year and then rates remain flat in the second year 
in both the up and down scenarios  the model assumes a parallel shift in the yield curve 
the results of these simulations are then compared to the base case 
at december   our asset liability position was neutral based on our interest rate sensitivity model 
our net interest income would decrease by less than in a down basis point scenario and would increase less than in an up basis point scenario over a one year time frame 
in the two year time horizon  our net interest income would decrease by less than in a down basis point scenario and would increase by less than in an up basis point scenario 
see also interest rate sensitivity in item above for a discussion of our interest rate risk 
we have counter party risk which may arise from the possible inability of george mason third party investors to meet the terms of their forward sales contracts 
george mason works with third party investors that are generally well capitalized  are investment grade and exhibit strong financial performance to mitigate this risk 
we do not expect any third party investor to fail to meet its obligation 
in addition  we have derivative counterparty risk relating to certain interest rate swaps we have with third parties 
this risk may arise from the inability of the third party to meet the terms of the contract 
we monitor the financial condition of these third parties on an annual basis 
we do not expect these third parties to fail to meet their obligations
