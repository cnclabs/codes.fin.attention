critical accounting estimates accounting estimates that we believe are most important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results and forecasts 
also includes changes in accounting standards 
overview our results of operations for were impacted by the following key transactions and events rambus antitrust litigation on may   rambus  inc rambus filed a complaint in the superior court of the state of california san francisco county against us and other dram suppliers alleging that the defendants harmed rambus by engaging in concerted and unlawful efforts affecting rambus dram rdram by eliminating competition and stifling innovation in the market for computer memory technology and computer memory chips 
rambus complaint alleges various causes of action under california state law including  among other things  a conspiracy to restrict output and fix prices  a conspiracy to monopolize  intentional interference with prospective economic advantage  and unfair competition 
rambus is seeking a judgment for damages of approximately billion  joint and several liability  trebling of damages awarded  punitive damages  a permanent injunction enjoining the defendants from the conduct alleged in the complaint  interest  and attorneys fees and costs 
trial began on june   and the case went to the jury on september  at the time of this filing  a jury verdict is pending 
we cannot predict when a verdict will be reached or when a formal judgment would be entered by the court subsequent to a verdict 
on september   we entered into a judgment sharing agreement with hynix semiconductor  inc  a co defendant in the case  pursuant to which each party agreed  if found liable  to share equally any joint and several damages 
in the event of an adverse judgment  we would anticipate filing appropriate post judgment motions and appeals 
we may be required to post a bond or other security to stay enforcement of an adverse judgment pending appeal 
depending on the amount required  there can be no assurance we would be able to obtain sufficient security to pursue an appeal 
we are unable to predict the outcome of this lawsuit and therefore cannot determine the likelihood of loss nor estimate a range of possible loss 
accordingly  we have not provided an accrual for an adverse judgment in the september   financial statements 
however  we have accrued a liability and charged operations for estimated costs to successfully defend the matter 
an adverse judgment may have a material impact on our business  results of operations and financial condition  including liquidity 
numonyx holdings bv numonyx on may   we acquired numonyx  which manufactured and sold primarily nor flash and nand flash memory products 
the total fair value of the consideration paid for numonyx was  million and consisted of million shares of our common stock issued to the numonyx shareholders and million restricted stock units issued to employees of numonyx 
in connection with the acquisition  we recorded net assets of  million 
because the fair value of the net assets acquired exceeded the purchase price  we recognized a gain on the acquisition of million in the third quarter of in addition  we recognized a million income tax benefit in connection with the acquisition 
see item financial statements notes to consolidated financial statements numonyx note 
japan fabrication facility on june   we sold our wafer fabrication facility in japan the japan fab to tower semiconductor ltd 
tower 
under the arrangement  tower paid million in cash and approximately million of tower ordinary shares 
in addition  we will receive an aggregate amount of million in twelve equal monthly installments beginning in the second quarter of we recorded a gain of million net of transaction costs of million in connection with the sale of the japan fab 
we also recorded a tax provision of million related to the gain on the sale and to write down certain deferred tax assets associated with the japan fab 
in connection with the sale of the japan fab  we entered into a supply agreement for tower to manufacture products for us in the facility through approximately may business segments in the second quarter of  we reorganized our business to better align with the markets we serve 
all prior period amounts have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect this reorganization 
after the reorganization  we have the following four reportable segments dram solutions group dsg includes dram products sold to the pc  consumer electronics  networking and server markets 
nand solutions group nsg includes high volume nand flash products sold into data storage  personal music players  and the high density computing markets  as well as nand flash products sold to intel through our consolidated im flash joint ventures 
wireless solutions group wsg includes dram  nand flash and nor flash products  including multi chip packages  sold to the mobile device market 
embedded solutions group esg includes dram  nand flash and nor flash products sold into automotive and industrial applications  as well as nor and nand flash sold to consumer electronics  networking  pc and server markets 
our other operations do not meet the quantitative thresholds of a reportable segment and are reported under all other 
all other includes our cmos image sensor  led  microdisplay and solar operations

nsg sales for increased as compared to primarily due to increases in gigabit sales partially offset by declines in average selling prices 
total net sales for increased as compared to as a result of improved sales across all reportable segments 
increases in dsg and nsg sales for primarily reflect significant increases in gigabits sold for both segments and improved average selling prices for dsg products 
increases in esg and wsg sales for were primarily the result of the acquisition of numonyx 
gross margin our overall gross margin percentage declined from for to for primarily due to a significant decline in the gross margin for dsg as a result of the dramatic decreases in average selling prices mitigated by a reduction in costs per gigabit 
declines in the gross margins of nsg  wsg and esg  primarily due to declines in average selling prices  also contributed to the overall decrease in gross margin for as compared to the impact of declines in average selling prices for was partially offset by cost reductions 
our overall gross margin percentage improved to for from negative for primarily due to improvements in the gross margin for all reportable segments as a result of cost reductions and improved dram pricing 
our gross margin percentage was also impacted by our acquisition of numonyx in may of as gross margins for numonyx activities were for the period after the acquisition 
our gross margins in prior years were impacted by charges to write down inventories to their estimated market values as a result of the significant decreases in average selling prices for both dram and nand flash products 
as charges to write down inventories are recorded in advance of when inventories are sold  gross margins in subsequent reporting periods are higher than they otherwise would be 
our gross margins for and were million and million higher as a result of the net impact of sales of products that had been written down to their estimated marked values in prior periods 
in future periods  we will be required to record additional inventory write downs if estimated average selling prices of products held in finished goods and work in process inventories at a quarter end date are below the manufacturing cost of those products 
operating results by business segments dram solutions group dsg net sales operating income loss dsg sales and operating results track closely with our average selling prices  gigabit sales volumes and cost per gigabit for our consolidated sales of dram products 
see operating results by product groups dram for further detail 
dsg sales for decreased from primarily due to significant declines in average selling prices partially offset by an increase in sales volume 
dsg operating income decreased from to primarily as a result of the significant declines in average selling prices  mitigated by reductions in manufacturing costs per gigabit as a result of improved production efficiencies 
the significant declines in dsg sales and margins for compared to was primarily attributable to a severe decrease in demand for pc dram  particularly for ddr dram  due to overall weakness in the pc market 
decreases in pc dram margins for were mitigated by the relatively higher margins in our server and other premium markets 
dsg operating income for benefited from the following items as compared to the corresponding periods of lower sg a costs primarily due to costs recognized in the third quarter of from the settlement of litigation in dram antitrust matters  lower r d costs primarily due to the dram r d cost sharing agreement with nanya that commenced in the third quarter of  and a million gain in from a license arrangement with samsung 
we have formed partnering arrangements and have sold or licensed technology to other parties 
dsg recognized royalty and license revenue of million in  million in and million in we have a partnering arrangement with nanya pursuant to which we and nanya jointly develop process technology and designs to manufacture stack dram products 
in addition  we have deployed and licensed certain intellectual property related to the manufacture of stack dram products to nanya and licensed certain intellectual property from nanya 
we recognized million and million of license revenue in net sales from this arrangement during and  respectively 
in april the license agreement was completed and we began to share dram development costs with nanya on an approximately equal basis 
this cost sharing arrangement reduced our overall research and development costs by million and million for and  respectively  of which million and million was attributed to dsg 
dsg received royalties of million and million in and  respectively  from nanya for sales of stack dram products manufactured by or for nanya on process nodes of nm or larger and we expect to continue to receive royalties from nanya associated with technology developed prior to the cost sharing arrangement 
dsg sales for increased from primarily due to increases in gigabits sold and average selling prices per gigabit 
the increase in gigabits sold for was largely due to additional supply obtained from inotera  which accounted for of our dram gigabit production in as compared to for the increase in average selling prices in for dsg products from improved market conditions was partially offset by a shift in product mix resulting from increases in sales of inotera trench dram products that had significantly lower average selling prices per gigabit than our other dsg products 
nand solutions group nsg net sales operating income loss nsg sales and operating results track closely with our average selling prices  gigabit sales volumes and cost per gigabit for our consolidated sales of nand flash products 
nsg sales for increased from primarily due to increases in gigabits sold partially offset by declines in average selling prices 
we sell nsg products in three principal channels to intel corporation intel through our im flash consolidated joint ventures at long term negotiated prices approximating cost  to original equipment manufacturers oems and other resellers and to retailers 
nsg sales through im flash to intel were million for  million for and million for the ramp of production at im flash new wafer fabrication facility in singapore began to increase our nand flash production in the second half of and we expect that it will significantly increase our nand flash production in our share of the operating costs and supply of nand flash from imfs adjusts in proportion to changes in our ownership share either months or months depending on the status of imfs production ramp from the date of the applicable ownership change 
accordingly  we anticipate that our share of imfs costs and supply will increase from as of september  to our current ownership interest in imfs during the course of in september  subsequent to the end of our  we contributed million and intel contributed million to imfs  decreasing our ownership interest in imfs to 
the following table presents the contributions and ownership percentages of imfs contributions ownership percentage micron intel micron intel prior to the second quarter of second quarter of third quarter of fourth quarter of first quarter of second quarter of third quarter of fourth quarter of subsequent to fourth quarter of through october nsg sales of nand flash products to our oem  reseller and retail customers decreased for as compared to primarily due to declines in average selling prices partially offset by an an increase in gigabits sold 
nsg operating income increased for as compared to despite declines in average selling prices due to reductions in manufacturing costs per gigabit as a result of improved production efficiencies and higher nand flash production and other operating gains including a million gain from the samsung license arrangement 
nsg costs of goods sold for  and included million  million and million  respectively of underutilized capacity costs from the imfs wafer fabrication facility in singapore 
we expect that the underutilized capacity costs will decrease significantly in due to the qualification of imfs products for sale in the third quarter of nsg sales for increased from primarily due to an increase in gigabits produced partially offset by a decline in average selling prices per gigabit 
the decline in average selling prices was primarily due to declines in prices on sales of nand flash to intel as a result of cost reductions and were partially offset by increases in average selling prices to trade customers 
nsg operating income improved for from primarily due to reductions in costs per gigabit 
the reductions in manufacturing costs per gigabit for were partially offset by the declines in overall average selling prices per gigabit 
nsg operating income for included a million gain from termination of a supply agreement with intel 
wireless solutions group wsg net sales operating income loss in  wsg sales were composed of nor flash  nand flash and dram in decreasing order of revenue 
the increase in wsg sales for as compared to was primarily due to the acquisition of numonyx in may of wsg experienced pricing pressure in due to weakness in demand from certain customers 
in addition  during and  a portion of the nand flash sold by wsg was obtained from hynix at market prices and by the end of  substantially all of this supply was obtained from lower cost micron production 
the improvement in wsg operating income for is primarily due to a million gain from the samsung license arrangement recognized by wsg in the significant increase in wsg sales for as compared to was primarily due to the acquisition of numonyx 
operating loss for wsg improved for from primarily due to cost reductions and improvements in average selling prices  partially offset by higher r d expenses 
embedded solutions group esg net sales operating income loss in  esg sales were composed of nor flash  dram and nand flash in decreasing order of revenue 
the increase in esg sales for as compared to was primarily due to the acquisition of numonyx in may of absent impacts from the numonyx acquisition  esg performance in the automotive  industrial and networking markets was relatively stable from to in addition  during and  a portion of the nand flash sold by esg was obtained from hynix at market prices and by the end of  the majority of this supply was obtained from lower cost micron production 
the improvement in esg operating income for is primarily due to the acquisition of numonyx 
in addition  esg recognized a million gain from the samsung license arrangement in the significant increase in esg sales for as compared to was primarily due to the acquisition of numonyx 
operating income for esg improved for from primarily due to cost reductions and improvements in average selling prices  partially offset by higher r d expenses 
operating results by product net sales by product dram nand flash nor flash other partially as a result of a decrease in dram product sales in and an increase in nand flash product sales during the same period  in the fourth quarter of  sales of nand flash products were higher than sales of dram products 
this marks the first time in our history that the primary product by revenue was not dram 
dram percentage change from prior year net sales average selling prices per gigabit gigabits sold cost reduction per gigabit the increase in gigabit sales of dram products for as compared to was primarily due to increased output obtained from our inotera joint venture and improved production efficiencies 
sales of ddr and ddr dram  were and  respectively  of total dram sales for and and  respectively  of total dram sales for the gross margin percentage on sales of dram products for declined significantly as compared to primarily due to the declines in average selling prices particularly for ddr dram sold into the pc market  partially offset by cost reductions resulting from improvements in manufacturing efficiencies 
the gross margin percentage for was also adversely affected by an increasing percentage of products obtained from inotera 
the gross margin percentage on sales of dram products for improved significantly as compared to primarily due to cost reductions and increases in average selling prices 
we have rights and obligations to purchase of inotera wafer production capacity under a supply agreement with inotera the inotera supply agreement 
dram products acquired from inotera accounted for of our dram gigabit production in as compared to for and for products obtained from inotera in were primarily ddr for the pc market 
our cost of wafers purchased under the inotera supply agreement is based on a margin sharing formula among nanya  inotera  and ourselves 
under such formula  all parties manufacturing costs related to wafers supplied by inotera  as well as our and nanya revenue for the resale of products from wafers supplied by inotera  are considered in determining costs for wafers acquired from inotera 
in  the cost of wafers purchased from inotera was significantly higher than our cost of wafers manufactured in our facilities 
because of significant market declines in the selling price of dram  inotera incurred net losses of million for the six month period ended june  also  inotera current liabilities exceeded its current assets by billion as of june   which exposes inotera to liquidity risk 
further  under generally accepted accounting principles in the republic of china  inotera reported a loss for its quarter ended september  of an additional new taiwan dollars  million approximately million us dollars 
inotera management has developed plans to improve its liquidity 
we cannot assure you that inotera plan to improve its liquidity will be successful 
nand flash percentage change from prior year nand flash sales to trade customers net sales average selling prices per gigabit gigabits sold cost reduction increase per gigabit nand flash sales to intel net sales average selling prices per gigabit gigabits sold cost reduction per gigabit approximately half of our output of nand flash products has been sold to intel through our im flash consolidated joint ventures at long term negotiated prices approximating cost 
sales of nand flash products to intel were million for  million for and million for see segment operating results nand solutions group for further detail 
the remainder of our sales of nand flash products is to trade customers ie  customers other than intel 
we sell nand flash products in various forms  including discrete standalone devices as well as in multi chip packages mcps and other nand flash systems solution products 
mcps and system solutions products  which combine nand flash devices with a controller and or other semiconductor devices  generally have significantly higher average selling prices and costs per gigabit than discrete nand flash devices 
our sales of mcps and other system solution nand flash products increased in from due primarily to our acquisition of numonyx and to targeted efforts at increasing sales of these products 
our mix of single level cell slc and multi level cell mlc nand flash products also impacted our average selling prices and sales volumes 
slc products have fewer bits per wafer but higher average selling prices per gigabit as compared to mlc products 
these shifts in the mix of our products increased our average selling prices and cost per gigabit in as compared to increases in gigabits sold for both and were primarily due to increased production efficiencies 
the ramp of the imfs wafer fabrication facility in singapore also contributed to the increase in production for our acquisition of numonyx in may also contributed to increases in sales volumes to trade customers in and the gross margin percentage on sales of nand flash products to trade customers for declined as compared to primarily due to the declines in average selling prices 
the gross margin percentage on sales of nand flash products to trade customers for improved as compared to primarily due to cost reductions and by the increases in average selling prices 
nor flash the increases in our sales of nor flash products for and were primarily due to our acquisition of numonyx in may as all of our sales of nor flash originated from this acquisition 
our gross margin percentage on sales of nor products for improved slightly as compared to primarily due to cost reductions 
operating expenses and other selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for increased as compared to primarily due to increased costs associated with numonyx operations and higher payroll costs  partially offset by a reduction in legal costs 
the reduction in legal costs from to was primarily due to million of costs in for estimated settlements in an indirect purchasers antitrust case and other matters 
sg a expenses for increased from primarily due to the costs associated with the indirect purchasers settlements  increased costs associated with numonyx operations  higher payroll costs and numonyx acquisition costs 
the increase in sg a expenses for was partially offset by a reduction in expenses for imaging operations as a result of the sale of a interest in aptina imaging corporation aptina in the fourth quarter of we expect that sg a expenses will approximate million to million for the first quarter of research and development r d expenses for increased from primarily due to the following increased costs associated with r d activities for acquired numonyx operations  higher payroll costs  and a higher volume of pre qualification wafers processed 
increases in r d costs for from the above factors was partially offset by amounts received under a dram cost sharing arrangement with nanya that commenced in the third quarter of as a result of amounts reimbursable from nanya under the dram r d cost sharing arrangement  r d expenses were reduced by million for and million for r d expenses for decreased from primarily due to the following a dram cost sharing arrangement with nanya that commenced in  and a reduction in r d costs for imaging products as a result of the sale of a interest in aptina in the fourth quarter of decreases in r d costs for from the above factors was partially offset by higher payroll expenses resulting from the accrual of incentive based compensation costs and additional million of r d expenses in connection with the may  acquisition of numonyx 
as a result of amounts reimbursable from intel under a nand flash r d cost sharing arrangement  r d expenses were reduced by million  million and million for  and respectively 
we expect that r d expenses  net of amounts reimbursable from our r d partners  will be approximately million to million for the first quarter of our process technology r d efforts are focused primarily on development of successively smaller line width process technologies which are designed to facilitate our transition to next generation memory products 
additional process technology r d efforts focus on the enablement of advanced computing and mobile memory architectures  the investigation of new opportunities that leverage our core semiconductor expertise and the development of new manufacturing materials 
product design and development efforts are concentrated on our high density ddr dram and lp ddr mobile low power dram products as well as high density and mobile nand flash memory including multi level cell technology  nor flash memory  specialty memory  phase change and memory systems 
interest income expense interest expense for  and  included aggregate amounts of non cash amortization of debt discount and issuance costs of million  million and million  respectively 
net proceeds received at inception from some of our convertible notes were allocated between a liability component issued at a discount and an equity component 
the debt discount is being amortized from issuance through the expected maturity dates of such convertible notes  with the amortization recorded as additional non cash interest expense 
included in the aggregate noncash interest expense is amortization on the convertible notes of million for  million for and million for see item financial statements notes to consolidated financial statements debt note 
other non operating income expense  net other non operating expense for included a million loss recognized in the first quarter of in connection with a series of debt restructure transactions with certain holders of our convertible notes

income taxes equity method investments equity plans liquidity and capital resources as of september  and september   we had the following cash and equivalents as of bank deposit accounts money market accounts certificates of deposit aggregate cash and equivalents includes million and million held by im flash to mitigate credit risk  we invest through high credit quality financial institutions and  by policy  generally limit the concentration of credit exposure by restricting investments with any single obligor 
our ability to access funds held by im flash to finance our other operations is subject to agreement by the joint venture partners and contractual limitations 
amounts held by im flash are not anticipated to be available to finance our other operations 
cash generated by operations is our primary source of liquidity 
our liquidity is highly dependent on average selling prices for our products and the timing and level of our capital expenditures  both of which can vary significantly from period to period 
depending on conditions in the semiconductor memory market  our cash flows from operations and current holdings of cash and investments may not be adequate to meet our needs for capital expenditures and operations 
we may pursue additional financing alternatives in the future as cost effective and strategic opportunities arise 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was  million for  which reflected approximately  million generated from the production and sales of our products  million net of tax from a patent cross license agreement with samsung offset by a net million effect from an increase in the amount invested in working capital  primarily due to a million increase in inventories 
investing activities net cash used for investing activities was  million for  which consisted primarily of cash expenditures of  million for property  plant and equipment and million for the acquisition of noncontrolling interests in tech  partially offset by million released from restricted cash 
we believe that to develop new product and process technologies  support future growth  achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality  we must continue to invest in manufacturing technologies  facilities and capital equipment and research and development 
we estimate that capital spending for will be approximately billion  the majority of which is expected to be incurred in the first half of the actual amounts for will vary depending on market conditions 
as of september   we had commitments of approximately million for the acquisition of property  plant and equipment  substantially all of which is expected to be paid within one year 
amounts released to us from restricted cash in included the following million of restricted cash collateral released to us in connection with the termination of our guarantee of a loan for a former joint venture as a result of the underlying loan being repaid  and million of previously restricted cash that was released to us as a result of our prepayment of the tech credit facility in financing activities net cash used for financing activities was  million for  which included  million of payments on debt  million of payments on equipment purchase contracts  million of distributions to joint venture partners partially offset by million of proceeds from convertible debt offerings and million of proceeds from equipment sale leaseback financing transactions 
on july   we issued million of convertible senior notes due august  the a notes and million of convertible senior notes due august  the b notes and together with the a notes the notes at face value 
issuance costs for the notes totaled million 
on july   concurrent with the offering of the notes  we entered into capped call transactions the capped calls that have an initial strike price of approximately per share  subject to certain adjustments  which was set to equal initial conversion price of the notes 
on july   we paid million to repurchase million shares of common stock at per share 
in the third quarter of  we prepaid the remaining million outstanding under our tech subsidiary credit facility 
on november   we completed the following series of debt restructure transactions in connection with separate privately negotiated agreements entered into on october  with certain holders of our convertible notes repurchased million in aggregate principal amount of our convertible senior notes due the notes for million in cash

we made contributions to im flash of  million in and million in september  subsequent to intel did not make any contributions to im flash in but contributed million in september we expect to make additional significant contributions to im flash in future periods in connection with tool installations and the further ramp of production at the singapore facility 
the level of our future capital contributions to im flash will depend on market conditions and the extent to which intel participates with us in future im flash capital calls 
in the second quarter of  we acquired hp and canon interests in our tech subsidiary for an aggregate of million and we became a owner of tech as a result of these transactions 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of september  total less than year years years more than years notes payable capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities total includes interest the obligations disclosed above do not include contractual obligations recorded on our balance sheet as current liabilities except for the current portion of long term debt 
the expected timing of payment amounts of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information 
timing and actual amounts paid may differ depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services  market prices  changes to agreed upon amounts or timing of certain events for some obligations 
purchase obligations include all commitments to purchase goods or services of either a fixed or minimum quantity that meet any of the following criteria they are noncancellable  we would incur a penalty if the agreement was canceled  or we must make specified minimum payments even if it does not take delivery of the contracted products or services take or pay 
if the obligation to purchase goods or services is noncancellable  the entire value of the contract was included in the above table 
if the obligation is cancellable  but we would incur a penalty if canceled  the dollar amount of the penalty was included as a purchase obligation 
contracted minimum amounts specified in take or pay contracts are also included in the above table as they represent the portion of each contract that is a firm commitment 
pursuant to the inotera supply agreement  we have an obligation to purchase of inotera s semiconductor memory capacity subject to specific terms and conditions 
as purchase quantities are based on qualified production output  the inotera supply agreement does not contain a fixed or minimum purchase quantity and therefore we did not include our obligations under the inotera supply agreement in the contractual obligations table above 
our obligation under the inotera supply agreement also fluctuates due to pricing which is based on manufacturing costs and revenues associated with the resale of dram products 
we purchased million of dram products from inotera in under the inotera supply agreement 
off balance sheet arrangements concurrent with the offering of the notes on july   we entered into capped call transactions the capped calls that have an initial strike price of approximately per share  subject to certain adjustments  which was set to the initial conversion price of the notes 
the capped calls are in four equal tranches  have cap prices of   and per share  and cover  subject to anti dilution adjustments similar to those contained in the notes  an approximate combined total of million shares of common stock 
the capped calls expire on various dates between july and february the capped calls are intended to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the notes 
concurrent with the offering of the convertible senior notes due the notes in april  we paid approximately million for three capped call instruments that have an initial strike price of approximately per share the capped calls 
the capped calls have a cap price of per share and cover an aggregate of approximately million shares of common stock

critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
estimates and judgments are based on historical experience  forecasted events and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
estimates and judgments may vary under different assumptions or conditions 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
our management believes the accounting policies below are critical in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and requires management most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
business acquisitions accounting for acquisitions requires us to estimate the fair value of consideration paid and the individual assets and liabilities acquired  which involves a number of judgments  assumptions and estimates that could materially affect the amount and timing of costs recognized 
we typically obtain independent third party valuation studies to assist in determining fair values  including assistance in determining future cash flows  appropriate discount rates and comparable market values 
consolidations we have interests in joint venture entities that are variable interest entities vies 
determining whether to consolidate a vie may require judgment in assessing whether an entity is a vie and if we are the entity primary beneficiary 
to determine if we are the primary beneficiary of a vie  we evaluate whether we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the vie economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie 
our evaluation includes identification of significant activities and an assessment of our ability to direct those activities based on governance provisions and arrangements to provide or receive product and process technology  product supply  operations services  equity funding and financing and other applicable agreements and circumstances 
our assessment of whether we are the primary beneficiary of our vies requires significant assumptions and judgment 
contingencies we are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies 
considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies 
an accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we accrue a liability and charge operations for the estimated costs of adjudication or settlement of asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date 
income taxes we are required to estimate our provision for income taxes and amounts ultimately payable or recoverable in numerous tax jurisdictions around the world 
these estimates involve judgment and interpretations of regulations and are inherently complex 
resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions may not be known for many years after completion of any fiscal year 
we are also required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis in accordance with us gaap  which requires the assessment of our performance and other relevant factors 
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or market value and we recorded charges of million in aggregate for and million in aggregate for to write down the carrying value of inventories of memory products to their estimated market values 
cost includes labor  material and overhead costs  including product and process technology costs 
determining market value of inventories involves numerous judgments  including projecting average selling prices and sales volumes for future periods and costs to complete products in work in process inventories 
to project average selling prices and sales volumes  we review recent sales volumes  existing customer orders  current contract prices  industry analysis of supply and demand  seasonal factors  general economic trends and other information 
when these analyses reflect estimated market values below our manufacturing costs  we record a charge to cost of goods sold in advance of when the inventory is actually sold 
differences in forecasted average selling prices used in calculating lower of cost or market adjustments can result in significant changes in the estimated net realizable value of product inventories and accordingly the amount of write down recorded 
for example  a variance in the estimated selling prices would have changed the estimated market value of our memory inventory by approximately million at september  due to the volatile nature of the semiconductor memory industry  actual selling prices and volumes often vary significantly from projected prices and volumes and  as a result  the timing of when product costs are charged to operations can vary significantly 
us gaap provides for products to be grouped into categories in order to compare costs to market values 
the amount of any inventory write down can vary significantly depending on the determination of inventory categories 
our inventories have been categorized as memory  imaging and microdisplay products 
the major characteristics we consider in determining inventory categories are product type and markets 
property  plant and equipment we review the carrying value of property  plant and equipment for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and or disposition 
in cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets 
the estimation of future cash flows involves numerous assumptions which require judgment by us  include  but are not limited to  future use of the assets for our operations versus sale or disposal of the assets  future selling prices for our products and future production and sales volumes 
in addition  judgment is required by us in determining the groups of assets for which impairment tests are separately performed 
research and development costs related to the conceptual formulation and design of products and processes are expensed as research and development as incurred 
determining when product development is complete requires judgment by us 
we deem development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability 
subsequent to product qualification  product costs are valued in inventory 
stock based compensation compensation cost for stock based compensation is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period of the award 
for stock based compensation awards with graded vesting that were granted after  we recognize compensation expense using the straight line amortization method 
for performance based stock awards  the expense recognized is dependent on the probability of the performance measure being achieved 
we utilize forecasts of future performance to assess these probabilities and this assessment requires considerable judgment 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment  including estimating stock price volatility  expected option life and forfeiture rates 
we develop these estimates based on historical data and market information which can change significantly over time 
a small change in the estimates used can result in a relatively large change in the estimated valuation 
we use the black scholes option valuation model to value employee stock awards 
we estimate stock price volatility based on an average of its historical volatility and the implied volatility derived from traded options on our stock 
recently adopted accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a new accounting standard on variable interest entities vies which replaces the quantitative based risks and rewards calculation for determining whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary in a vie with an approach that is primarily qualitative  requires ongoing assessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a vie and requires additional disclosures about an enterprise involvement in vie 
we adopted this standard as of the beginning of the initial adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on our financial statements as of the adoption date 
the impact on future periods will depend on changes in the nature and composition of our vies 
recently issued accounting standards in may  the fasb issued a new accounting standard on fair value measurements that clarifies the application of existing guidance and disclosure requirements  changes certain fair value measurement principles and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements 
we are required to adopt this standard in the third quarter of we do not expect this adoption to have a material impact on our financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued a new accounting standard on the presentation of comprehensive income 
the new standard requires the presentation of comprehensive income  the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the new standard also requires presentation of adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income in the statement where the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income are presented 
we are required to adopt this standard as of the beginning of the adoption of this standard will only impact the presentation of our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclolsures about market risk interest rate risk as of september    million of our  million of debt was at fixed interest rates 
as a result  the fair value fluctuates based on changes in market interest rates 
the estimated fair value of our debt was  million as of september  and  million as of september  we estimate that  as of september   a decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of our fixed rate debt instruments by approximately million 
as of september   million of the debt had variable interest rates and a increase in the rates would increase annual interest expense by approximately million 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the information in this section should be read in conjunction with the information related to changes in the exchange rates of foreign currency in item a 
risk factors 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
the functional currency for substantially all of our operations is the us dollar 
we held cash and other assets in foreign currencies valued at an aggregate of us million as of september  and us million as of september  we also had foreign currency liabilities valued at an aggregate of us million as of september   and us million as of september  because the substantial majority of our sales are denominated in us dollar  we do not have significant natural hedges to offset our expenditures denominated in other currencies 
significant components of assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar our reporting currency were as follows in us dollar equivalents singapore dollars yen euro other singapore dollars yen euro other amounts in millions cash and cash equivalents receivables deferred tax assets other assets accounts payable and accrued expenses debt other liabilities net assets liabilities we estimate that  based on the assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar as of september   a change in the exchange rate versus the us dollar  resulting in currency gains or losses of approximately us million for the euro and million for the yen and singapore dollar 
during  we began using derivative instruments to hedge our foreign currency exchange rate risk
