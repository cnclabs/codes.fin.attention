anticipated contributions beyond one year are not determinable 
the total accrued benefit liability for the company pension plans recognized as of december  was million 
this amount is impacted by  among other items  pension expense funding levels  changes in plan demographics and assumptions  and investment return on plan assets 
therefore  the company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which the liability might be paid  and did not include this amount in the contractual obligations table 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
b contractual development obligations consist primarily of cash that the company is obligated to pay upon achievement of product development and other milestones 
c capital commitment obligations consist primarily of cash that the company is obligated to pay to its limited partnership and limited liability corporation investees 
these investees make equity investments in various development stage biopharmaceutical and medical device companies  and it is not certain if and or when these payments will be made 
d as of december   the liability for uncertain tax positions including interest was million 
as a result of on going negotiations of advanced pricing agreements between switzerland and the united states and between japan and the united states  the expiration of statutes of limitations  and the possible settlement of on going audits in several jurisdictions for multiple years throughout the world  the total liability for unrecognized tax benefits may change within the next months 
the range of such change could vary  but the amount of such change is not expected to be material 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company results of operations and financial position are determined based upon the application of the company accounting policies  as discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
certain of the company accounting policies represent a selection among acceptable alternatives under generally 
table of contents accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap 
in evaluating the company transactions  management assesses all relevant gaap and chooses the accounting policy that most accurately reflects the nature of the transactions 
the application of accounting policies requires the use of judgment and estimates 
as it relates to the company  estimates and forecasts are required to determine sales returns and reserves  rebate reserves  allowances for doubtful accounts  reserves for excess and obsolete inventory  investments in unconsolidated affiliates  the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets  the allocation of purchase price for acquisitions  workers compensation liabilities  employee benefit related liabilities  income taxes  impairments of assets  forecasted transactions to be hedged  litigation reserves and contingencies 
these matters that are subject to judgments and estimation are inherently uncertain  and different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and estimates 
management uses its best estimates and judgments in determining the appropriate amount to reflect in the consolidated financial statements  using historical experience and all available information 
the company also uses outside experts where appropriate 
the company applies estimation methodologies consistently from year to year 
the company believes the following are the critical accounting policies which could have the most significant effect on the company reported results and require subjective or complex judgments by management 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned 
revenue is considered realized or realizable and earned upon delivery of the product  provided that an agreement of sale exists  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
in the case of certain products where the company maintains consigned inventory at customer locations  revenue is recognized at the time the company is notified that the customer has used the inventory 
the company sales terms are standard terms within the medical device industry  with title and risk of loss transferring upon delivery to the customer  limited right of return and no unusual provisions or conditions 
when the company recognizes revenue from the sale of its products  an estimate of various sales returns and allowances is recorded which reduces product sales and accounts receivable 
these adjustments include estimates for rebates  returns and other sales allowances 
these provisions are estimated and recorded at the time of sale based upon historical payment experience  historical relationship to revenues  estimated customer inventory levels  and current contract sales terms with direct and indirect customers 
product returns are not significant because returns are generally not allowed unless the product is damaged at time of receipt 
if the historical data and inventory estimates used to calculate these provisions do not approximate future activity  the company financial position  results of operations and cash flows could be impacted 
the company primary sales adjustment relates to distributor rebates which are given to the company united states distributors and represents the difference between the company sales price to the distributor at the company distributor list price and the negotiated price to be paid by the end customer 
this distributor rebate is recorded by the company as a reduction to sales and a reduction to the distributor accounts receivable at the time of sale to a distributor 
the company validates the distributor rebate accrual quarterly through either a review of the inventory reports obtained from its distributors or an estimate of its distributor inventory 
this distributor inventory information is used to verify the estimated liability for future distributor rebate claims based on historical rebates and contract rates 
the company periodically monitors current pricing trends and distributor inventory levels to ensure the liability for future distributor rebates is fairly stated 
the company also offers volume rebates to certain gpos and customers based upon target sales levels 
for volume rebates offered to gpos  the rebates are recorded as a reduction to sales and an obligation to the gpo 
for volume rebates offered to customers  the rebates are recorded as a reduction to sales and 
table of contents accounts receivable 
the provision for volume rebates is estimated based on customers contracted rebate programs and historical experience of rebates paid 
the company periodically monitors its customer rebate programs to ensure that the allowance and liability for accrued rebates is fairly stated 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company records allowances for doubtful accounts based on customer specific analysis and general matters such as current assessments of past due balances and economic conditions 
additional allowances for doubtful accounts may be required if there is deterioration in past due balances  if economic conditions are less favorable than the company has anticipated  or for customer specific circumstances  such as financial difficulty 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million at december  and  respectively 
excess and obsolete inventory the company records allowances for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and estimated future demand and market conditions 
additional inventory allowances may be required if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than the company has estimated 
a write down for excess or inactive inventory is recorded for inventory which is obsolete  nearing its expiration date generally triggered at six months prior to expiration  is damaged or slow moving defined as quantities in excess of a two year supply 
the allowance for excess and obsolete inventory was million and million at december  and  respectively 
patent costs the company expenses legal costs incurred for patent preparation and applications 
the company capitalizes certain legal costs related to the defense and enforcement of issued patents and trademarks 
these capitalized legal costs are amortized over the life of the related patent or trademark 
such legal costs are periodically reviewed for impairment and recoverability 
impairment of goodwill and long lived assets the company evaluates the carrying value of goodwill in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
in evaluating goodwill  the company completes a two step goodwill impairment test 
the company identifies its reporting units and determines the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including existing goodwill  to those reporting units 
the fair value of the reporting unit is estimated based on the company market capitalization and a market revenue multiple 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the company will perform the second step of the impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of a reporting unit goodwill with its carrying value 
in  and  the company did not perform the second step of the impairment test as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its respective carrying value 
additionally  management reviews the carrying amounts of other intangible and long lived tangible assets whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of an asset may not be recoverable 
impairment indicators include  among other conditions  cash flow deficits  historic or anticipated declines in revenue or operating profit  and adverse legal or regulatory developments 
if it is determined that such indicators are present and the review indicates that the assets will not be fully recoverable  based on undiscounted estimated cash flows over the remaining amortization periods  their carrying values are reduced to estimated fair market value 
estimated fair market value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
for the purposes of identifying and measuring impairment  long lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 

table of contents investments in unconsolidated affiliates investments in unconsolidated affiliates are long term equity investments in companies that are in various stages of development 
certain of these investments are designated as available for sale 
these investments are carried at fair market value  with unrealized gains and losses reported in stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive loss 
gains or losses on investments sold are based on the specific identification method 
other investments in unconsolidated affiliates are accounted for under the cost or the equity method of accounting  as appropriate 
the company accounts for investments in limited partnerships or limited liability corporations  whereby the company owns a minimum of of the investee outstanding voting stock  under the equity method of accounting 
these investments are recorded at the amount of the company investment and adjusted each period for the company share of the investee income or loss and dividends paid 
as investments accounted for under the cost method do not have readily determinable fair value  the company only estimates fair value if there are identified events or changes in circumstances that could have a significant adverse effect on the investment fair value 
when the fair value of an available for sale investment declines below cost  management uses the following criteria to determine if such a decline should be considered other than temporary and result in a recognized loss the duration and extent to which the market value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the investee  the reasons for the decline in market value  the investee performance against product development milestones  and the company ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company financial statements or tax returns 
the company evaluates quarterly the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance  if necessary 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are the company forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in the company effective tax rate on future earnings 
the company is subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in evaluating the company uncertain tax positions and determining its provision for income taxes 
the company recognizes the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that a position would more likely than not be sustained based upon its technical merit if challenged by the relevant taxing authority and taken by management to the court of last resort 
for tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold  the amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the relevant tax authority 
the company strives to resolve open matters with each tax authority at the examination level and could reach agreement with a tax authority at any time 
while the company has accrued for amounts it believes are the probable outcomes  the final outcome with a tax authority may result in a tax liability that is more or less than that reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
furthermore  the company may later decide to challenge any assessments  if made  and may exercise its right to appeal 
the uncertain tax positions are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as events occur that affect potential liabilities for additional taxes  such as 
table of contents lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations  proposed assessments by tax authorities  negotiations between tax authorities  identification of new issues and issuance of new legislation  regulations or case law 
management believes that adequate amounts of tax and related penalty and interest have been provided in income tax expense for any adjustments that may result from these uncertain tax positions 
as a result of on going negotiations of various advanced pricing agreements  the expiration of statutes of limitations  and the possible settlement of on going audits in several jurisdictions for multiple years throughout the world  the total liability for unrecognized tax benefits may change within the next months 
the range of such change could vary  but the amount of such change is not expected to be material 
the company has significant california research expenditure tax credits it expects to use in future periods 
the credits may be carried forward indefinitely 
based upon anticipated future taxable income  the company expects all california research expenditure tax credits to be fully utilized  accordingly  no valuation allowance has been provided 
stock based compensation the company measures and recognizes compensation expense for all stock based awards based on estimated fair values 
stock based awards consist of stock options  restricted stock units and employee stock purchase subscriptions 
the fair value of each option award and employee stock purchase subscription is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model 
the black scholes model requires various highly judgmental assumptions  including stock price volatility  risk free interest rate  and expected option term 
stock based compensation expense is recorded net of estimated forfeitures 
judgment is required in estimating the stock awards that will ultimately be forfeited 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and the company results of operations could be impacted 
new accounting standards not yet adopted in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an amendment to the accounting guidance on revenue recognition to require companies to allocate revenue in arrangements involving multiple deliverables based on estimated selling price in the absence of vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence of selling price for the deliverables

table of contents milestone is achieved only if the milestone meets all criteria to be considered substantive 
the guidance is effective for milestones achieved in fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning on or after june  the company does not expect the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements
