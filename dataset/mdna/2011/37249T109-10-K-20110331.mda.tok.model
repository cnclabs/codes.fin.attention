item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with  and is qualified in its entirety by  the more detailed information including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
this annual report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from the results and business plans discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that may cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed in item a 
risk factors as well as those discussed elsewhere in this annual report 
our business activities we are engaged  through our subsidiaries  in the exploration for and development of oil and natural gas reserves 
at december  we have not yet achieved our planned principal operations and are considered to be a development stage enterprise 
we initiated these activities in the recoverability of the costs we have incurred to date is uncertain and dependent upon achieving commercial production and sale of hydrocarbons  our ability to obtain sufficient financing to fulfill our obligations under the production sharing or other contracts we are a party to with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development activities in india  israel and colombia and upon future profitable operations 
at present  our activities are being undertaken in four geological basins located offshore and onshore in india  one geological basin located offshore israel and one geological basin located onshore in colombia where reserves of oil or natural gas are believed by our management to exist 
the exploration rights pursuant to pscs we have entered into with the government of india are located in the following areas the krishna godavari basin offshore and onshore in the state of andhra pradesh in south eastern india  the cambay basin onshore in the state of gujarat in western india  the deccan syneclise basin onshore in the state of maharashtra in west central india  and the bikaner nagaur basin onshore in the state of rajasthan in north western india 
page 
toc the exploration rights pursuant to licenses we have been granted in israel are located in the levantine basin located off the coast of israel with the licenses varying in distances between and miles offshore 
we have entered into a memorandum of understanding mou with respect to two exploration blocks located in the putumayo basin onshore in southwest colombia 
may saw the commencement of oil revenue from our tarapur exploration block in the cambay basin 
to date however  we have not achieved our planned principal operations and are considered to be in the development stage 
the recoverability of the exploration costs we have incurred to date is uncertain and dependent upon us achieving significant commercial production  our ability to obtain sufficient financing to fulfill our obligations under the pscs in india and upon future profitable operations 
all of the exploration activities in which we are a participant should be considered highly speculative 
results of operations for the years ended december  and for the year ended december  we incurred a net loss of million as compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  the increase in the net loss is mostly a result of realizing an asset impairment in of million compared with no asset impairment in the year oil and gas operations year ended december  year ended december  oil production barrels oil sales barrels oil sales average oil price per barrel gas sales mcf gas sales average gas price per mcf operating costs operating costs per barrel depletion depletion per barrel oil sales all of our oil sales are derived from production in india 
with the approval of the tarapur field development plan by the management committee  three wells began production in mid may  two in september and one in january there are ten additional wells which are drilled  tested and awaiting tie in to the oil tank storage facilities 
oil sales for the year ended december  were million or per barrel compared to oil sales for the year ended december  of million or per barrel 
oil sales are currently based on a discount to the spot price based on the nigeria bonny light crude bench mark 
to date  none of our production has been hedged 
gas sales in addition to the crude oil production from the six wells in tarapur  associated natural gas was contained and sold commencing january prior thereto  the associated natural gas was flared off 
as a result  total gas sales for the year ended december  was million or per mcf as compared to nil for the year ended december  there is one gas well awaiting approval for the development plan 
interest income interest income decreased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the same period in this decrease is directly related to the decrease in the amount of our invested cash balances 
operating costs operating costs for the year ended december  were million or per barrel  compared to million or per barrel for the year ended december  the operating costs include handling and processing charges  transportation costs  utilities  maintenance and tank rental charges and contain a fixed and variable portion

toc general and administrative our general and administrative expenses increased to million from million 
these general and administrative expenses include costs related to the corporate head office including administrative salaries and services  directors fees  rent and office costs  insurance  bank guarantee fees  nyse amex listing and filing fees  investor relation services and transfer agent fees and services 
also included in our general and administrative expenses are our compensation costs for stock based compensation arrangements with employees and directors which are being expensed over their respective vesting periods of the related option grants 
the majority of the increase in the general and administrative expenses is a result of an increase in directors fees of million combined with an increase in salaries and benefits of million and travel and hotel of million 
these increases are consistent with the restructuring of our management team including the addition of a new executive officer combined with our stepping into new ventures in israel and colombia 
these increases were offset by a decrease in stock based compensation costs from million to million for the same period in further offsets to the increase were a result of a charge of million in for the warrant modification that was not incurred in the year ending december  as well as a recovery of million as a result of an over accrual of estimated interest  penalties and related costs of million in regularizing our respective tax and regulatory filings in india 
consulting fees our consulting fees decreased to million during the year ended december  from million in the prior year 
consulting fees include fees and expenses we incurred in employing various technical and corporate consultants who advised us on a variety of matters 
this change is mostly attributable to the decrease for stock based compensation with non employee consultants for the year ended december  being million versus million for the year ended december  a portion of this decrease is also a result of consulting fees paid under our technical services agreement which expired in august with a corporation wholly owned by mr 
roy  whereby we expensed million during the year ended december  versus million during the year ended december  the balance of the decrease is a result of the cancellation in august of the agreement to pay consulting fees to di investments ltd  whereby we expensed million during the year ended december  versus million for the same period in professional fees professional fees decreased to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  professional fees include those paid to our auditors for pre approved audit  accounting and tax services and fees paid to our legal advisors primarily for services provided with regard to filing various periodic reports and other documents and reviewing our various oil and gas and other agreements 
this decrease is mostly a result of professional fees which were paid to various tax advisors to complete a review of our corporate structure with a goal to ensure tax compliance  strategy and efficiency across all jurisdictions in which we operate during incurred in the year ended december  not incurred in depletion and depreciation depletion and depreciation increased to million per barrel during the year ended december  from million per barrel during the year ended december  this increase is mostly attributable to the substantial increase in the amortization base for the depletion calculation as a result of the transfer of the abandoned well costs from unproven to proven properties combined with the decrease in the proved reserves based on an updated reserve report dated january  by chapman petroleum engineering ltd 
impairment of oil and gas properties during the year  we incurred asset impairment expenses of million versus nil during the year ended december  in  any impairment to exploration properties is transferred to our full cost pool which is subject to ceiling test limitations 
no impairment was recognized under our ceiling test in our asset impairment in consisted of million as a result of assessing our indian properties on an individual basis considering various factors  including land relinquishment and the absence of hydrocarbons in certain exploratory wells 
the exploration work programs have been completed on the four cambay blocks which accounted for the majority of the impairment with the relinquishment of all lands where there is not a discovery  as well as the abandonment of twenty two wells in the fourth quarter of further there was one well abandoned in one of the rajasthan blocks 
since the result of this assessment indicated impairment  the related costs incurred were charged to the statement of operations 
capitalized overhead on oil and gas properties we capitalize overhead costs directly related to our exploration activities in india 
during the year ended december   these capitalized overhead costs amounted to million as compared to million during the year ended december  the decrease is mostly attributable to a decrease in the capitalized portion of stock based compensation for our non employee consultants directly related in our oil and gas exploration activities for the year ended december  of million versus million for the year ended december  the treatment of capitalized overhead costs remained consistent with the prior year and includes costs relating to personnel  consultants  their travel  necessary resources and stock based compensation directly associated with the advancement of our oil and gas interests 
page 
toc results of operations for the years ended december  and for the year ended december   we incurred a net loss of million as compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  the decrease in net loss was mostly attributable to realizing an asset impairment in of million compared with no asset impairment in the year this decrease was offset by an increase in our general and administrative expenses and consulting fees combined with a decline in our interest income 
oil sales all of our oil sales are derived from production of crude oil in india 
with the approval of the tarapur field development plan by the management committee  three wells began production in mid may and two in september there are twelve additional wells which are drilled  tested and awaiting tie in to the oil tank storage facilities 
oil sales for the year ended december  were million or per barrel 
oil sales are currently based on the spot price based on the nigeria bonny light crude bench mark 
to date  none of our production has been hedged 
in addition to the crude oil production  a minimal amount of associated natural gas was produced and flared off 
commencing with the first quarter in  the associated natural gas has been contained and sold 
we did not generate any oil sales during the year ended december  interest income interest income decreased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the same period in this decrease was directly related to the decrease in us prime interest rate in as compared to as well a decrease in the amount of our invested cash balances 
operating costs operating costs for the year ended december  were million or per barrel  as a result of our first production in the tarapur field which commenced in may the operating costs include handling and processing charges  transportation costs  utilities  maintenance and tank rental charges and contain a fixed and variable portion

also included in our general and administrative expenses are our compensation costs for stock based compensation arrangements with employees and directors which were being expensed over their respective vesting periods of the related option grants 
these stock based compensation costs increased to million from million for the same period in the remaining majority of the increase in the general and administrative expenses was a result of an increase in directors fees of million and interest  penalties and related costs of million in regularizing our respective tax and regulatory filings in our various countries of operations consulting fees our consulting fees increased to million during the year ended december  from million in the prior year 
this change was mostly attributable to the increase for stock based compensation with non employee consultants for the year ended december  being million versus a reversal of million for the year ended december  a portion of this increase was also a result of the accounting for the consulting fees paid under our technical services agreement with a corporation wholly owned by mr 
roy  whereby we expensed million during the year ended december  versus million during the year ended december  the balance of the increase was a result of other fees and expenses we incurred in employing various technical and corporate consultants who advised us on a variety of matters 
professional fees professional fees decreased slightly to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  professional fees included those paid to our auditors for pre approved audit  accounting and tax services and fees paid to our legal advisors primarily for services provided with regard to filing various periodic reports and other documents and reviewing our various oil and gas and other agreements 
depletion and depreciation depletion and depreciation increased to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  as a result of our first production in the tarapur field we had depletion of million or per barrel for the year ended december  and depreciation of million 
no depletion expense and depreciation of million was recognized during the year ended december  page 
toc impairment of oil and gas properties during  we incurred no asset impairment expense versus million during the year ended december  in  any impairment to exploration properties was transferred to our full cost pool which is subject to ceiling test limitations 
no impairment was recognized under our ceiling test in our asset impairment in consisted of million as a result of our decision not to exercise our option on two exploration blocks in the arab republic of egypt and cease our exploration activities in oman and yemen 
the balance from of million was a result of assessing our indian properties on an individual basis considering various factors  including land relinquishment and the absence of hydrocarbons in certain exploratory wells 
since the result of this assessment indicated impairment  the related costs incurred were charged to the statement of operations 
capitalized overhead on oil and gas properties we capitalize overhead costs directly related to our exploration activities in india 
during the year ended december  these capitalized overhead costs amounted to million as compared to million during the year ended december  the difference was mostly attributable to an increase in the capitalized portion of the stock based compensation for our non employee consultants directly related in our oil and gas exploration activities for the year ended december  of million versus million for the year ended december  the treatment of capitalized overhead costs remained consistent with the prior year and includes costs relating to personnel  consultants  their travel  necessary resources and stock based compensation directly associated with the advancement of our oil and gas interests 
reserve report as a result of the approval of the tarapur field development plan by the management committee in april and the completion of an independent reserve study dated january  by chapman petroleum engineering ltd 
out of calgary  alberta  canada  we claim reserves in the tarapur field as at december  as follows summary of oil and gas reserves as of december  reserves category oil mbbls natural gas mmcf proved developed undeveloped total proved probable developed undeveloped possible developed undeveloped proved reserves proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas  which  by analysis of geoscience and engineering data  can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward from known reservoirs  and under existing economic conditions  operating methods and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire  unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain  regardless of whether determinable or probabilistic methods are used for the estimates 
the project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time 
probable reserves probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves but which  together with proved reserves  are as likely as not to be recovered 
liquidity liquidity is a measure of a company s ability to meet potential cash requirements 
we have historically met our capital requirements through the issuance of common stock as well as proceeds from the exercise of warrants and options to purchase common equity 
our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon obtaining the necessary financing to complete further exploration and development activities and generate profitable operations from our oil and natural gas interests in the future 
our current operations are dependent upon the adequacy of our current assets to meet our current expenditure requirements and the accuracy of management s estimates of those requirements 
should those estimates be materially incorrect  our ability to continue as a going concern will be impaired 
our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  have been prepared on a going concern basis  which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business 
we have incurred a history of operating losses and negative cash flows from operations 
these matters may raise doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
page 
toc at december  our cash and cash equivalents were million december  million 
the majority of this balance is being held in us funds  of which million is held in term deposits earning interest based on the us prime rate which will contribute to covering a portion of our administrative costs and overhead throughout we have working capital of approximately million available for the company s future operations 
in addition  we have million in restricted deposits pledged as security against the minimum work programs for our exploration blocks which will be released upon completion of those minimum work programs 
we expect to incur expenditures to further our exploration programs 
our existing cash balance and any cash flow from operating activities is not sufficient to satisfy our current obligations and meet our exploration commitments of million over the next three years 
we are considering various alternatives with respect to raising additional capital to remedy any future shortfall in capital but to date have made no specific plans or arrangements 
we deem it necessary to raise capital through equity markets  debt markets or other financing arrangements  including participation arrangements that may be available for continued exploration expenditures 
because of the early stage of our operations and our lack of any material oil and natural gas reserves  there can be no assurance this capital will be available and if it is not  we may be forced to substantially curtail or cease exploration  appraisal and development expenditures 
we believe that we will be able to raise additional capital which combined with our available cash resources will be sufficient to maintain our current level of activities through the next fiscal year 
should the going concern assumption not be appropriate and we are not able to realize our assets and settle our liabilities  commitments and contingencies in the normal course of operations  our consolidated financial statements would require adjustments to the amounts and classifications of assets and liabilities  and these adjustments could be significant 
our consolidated financial statements do not reflect the adjustments or reclassifications of assets and liabilities that would be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern 
years ended december  and during the year ended december  our overall position in cash and cash equivalents decreased by million  as compared to a net decrease in the comparable period of of million 
these cash movements were attributable to the following activities our net cash used in operating activities during the year ended december  was million as compared to million for the year ended december  this increase is mostly attributable to and consistent with the decrease in our current liabilities at december  to million from million at december  the remainder of the decrease is comprised of the increase in the cash expenditures combined with a decline in our revenue and other income from for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  cash used in investing activities during the year ended december  was million as compared to million during the year ended december  funds of million were used for exploration activities as compared to million in this decrease is attributable and consistent with the decrease in accounts payable from million at december  to million at december  offset by an increase in accrued liabilities from million to million respectively 
this combined with our increase in accounts receivable which is mostly attributable to an unexpended cash call receivable of for the seismic acquisition on our samuel exploration license at december  cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was as compared to nil during the year ended december  during the year ended december   shares of common stock were issued pursuant to two private placement financings for gross proceeds of million less share issuance costs of million 
there were no private placement sales of our securities during years ended december  and during the year ended december  our overall position in cash and cash equivalents decreased by million  as compared to a net decrease in the comparable period of of million 
these cash movements were attributable to the following activities our net cash used in operating activities during the year ended december  was million as compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease is attributable to and consistent with the increase in our current liabilities at december  to million from million at december  page 
toc cash used in investing activities during the year ended december  was million as compared to million during the year ended december  funds of million were used for exploration activities as compared to million in this decrease is consistent with the decrease in exploration activity in the year versus the year consequently  bank guarantees related to exploration activity also declined such that in the year ended december  funds were provided of million versus an outlay for such instruments of million in the year ended december  these bank guarantees have been provided and serve as guarantees for the performance of our minimum work programs and are in the form of irrevocable letters of credit which are secured by our term deposits in the same amount 
cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was nil as compared to cash provided by financing activities of million during the year ended december  during the year ended december   no shares were issued versus the issuance of  shares of common stock on the exercise of options in the prior year for gross proceeds of million 
there were no private placement sales of our securities during or capital resources we expect our exploration and development activities pursuant to our pscs in india will continue through in accordance with the terms of those agreements 
during the year and up to march   based on the current budgets in india  we anticipate drilling seven exploratory wells  two core wells  acquiring  processing and interpreting  line kilometers of d seismic data  and acquiring  processing and interpreting square kilometers of d seismic data as well as processing and interpreting an additional square kilometers of d seismic data 
we further expect to tie in additional oil wells in tarapur along with the construction of a gas pipeline for the tarapur g gas discovery and continue with the construction of the gas gathering and production facilities together with further development drilling on the kg offshore block in which we have a carried interest 
additional expenditures may be incurred in connection with additional exploratory  appraisal and development wells we may participate in 
also  if the government of india approves the increase to our participating interest in the kg onshore block to  our obligations to fund d seismic acquisition and exploratory drilling on the block will increase 
we expect our exploration activities pursuant to our licenses in israel will continue through in accordance with the terms of those agreements 
during the year  we expect to complete the acquisition  processing and interpretation of square kilometers of d seismic data in our samuel license as well as to complete the processing and interpretation of  square kilometers of d seismic data covering our sara and myra licenses and also commence drilling our first deepwater exploration well before the end of the year 
in addition  we may during seek to participate in joint ventures bidding for the acquisition of oil and gas interests in india and other countries 
as of march  we have no specific plans regarding such activities and have not entered into any binding agreements with respect to such activities 
we expect that our interest in any such ventures would involve a minority participating interest in the venture 
in addition  although there are no present plans to do so  as opportunities arise we may seek to acquire minority participating interests in exploration blocks where pscs have been heretofore awarded 
the acquisition of any such interests would be subject to the execution of a definitive agreement and obtaining the requisite government consents and other approvals 
as of march  the scope of any possible such activities has not been definitively established and  accordingly  we are unable to state the amount of any funds that will be required for these purposes 
as a result  no specific plans or arrangements have been made to raise additional capital and we have not entered into any agreements in that regard 
we expect that when we seek to raise additional capital it will be through the sale of equity securities  debt or other financing arrangements 
we are unable to estimate the terms on which such capital will be raised  the price per share or possible number of shares involved or the terms of any agreements to raise capital under other arrangements 
during the first quarter of  we hired a new senior executive 
we do not expect to have any further significant change in in our number of employees 
tabular disclosure of contractual obligations the following table sets forth our contractual obligations by type of agreement and amounts due during the year ended december  and each succeeding year thereafter

critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the information reported in our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
we base our assumptions and estimates on historical experience and other sources that we believe to be reasonable at the time 
actual results may vary from our estimates 
our significant accounting policies are detailed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we have outlined below certain accounting policies that are of particular importance to the presentation of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment or estimates by our management 
use of estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results may differ from these estimated amounts due to factors such as fluctuations in interest rates  currency exchange rates  inflation levels and commodity prices  changes in economic conditions and legislative and regulatory changes 
significant estimates with regard to the consolidated financial statements include the estimated carrying value of unproved properties  the estimated cost and timing related to asset retirement obligations  stock based compensation and contingencies 
oil and natural gas properties we use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and natural gas properties 
separate cost centers are maintained for each country in which we incur costs 
under this method  we capitalize all acquisition  exploration and development costs incurred for the purpose of finding oil and natural gas reserves  including salaries  benefits and other internal costs directly attributable to these activities 
costs associated with production and general corporate activities  however  are expensed in the period incurred 
to the extent that support equipment is used in oil and gas activities  the related depreciation is capitalized 
proceeds from the disposition of oil and natural gas properties are accounted for as a reduction of capitalized costs  with no gain or loss recognized unless such disposition would alter the depletion and depreciation rate by or more 
capitalized costs of development oil and natural gas properties may not exceed an amount equal to the present value  discounted at  of estimated future net revenues from proven reserves plus the lower of cost or fair value of unproven properties 
should capitalized costs exceed this ceiling  an impairment is recognized 
page 
toc the present value of estimated future net cash flows is computed by applying the average first day of the month prices during the previous twelve month period of oil and natural gas to estimated future production of proved oil and natural gas reserves as of year end less estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves and assuming continuation of existing economic conditions 
following the discovery of reserves and the commencement of production  we compute depletion of oil and natural gas properties using the unit of production method based upon production and estimates of proved reserve quantities 
we assess all items classified as unproved property on a quarterly basis for possible impairment or reduction in value 
we assess properties on an individual basis or as a group if properties are individually insignificant 
the assessment includes consideration of the following factors  among others land relinquishment  intent to drill  remaining lease term  geological and geophysical evaluations  drilling results and activity  the assignment of proved reserves  and the economic viability of development if proved reserves are assigned 
during any period in which these factors indicate an impairment  the related exploration costs incurred are transferred to the full cost pool and are then subject to depletion and the ceiling limitations on development oil and natural gas expenditures 
asset retirement obligation the fair values of estimated asset retirement obligations are recorded as liabilities when incurred and the associated cost is capitalized as part of the cost of the related asset 
the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement 
the liabilities are accreted as operating expense for the change in their time value 
the initial capitalized costs are included in depletion expense in a manner consistent with the related assets
