item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
management s discussion and analysis forward looking statements management discussion and analysis  and other sections of this annual report  contain forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these forward looking statements are based on assumptions that management has made in light of experience in the industries in which the company operates  as well as management perceptions of historical trends  current conditions  expected future developments and other factors believed to be appropriate under the circumstances 
these statements are not guarantees of performance or results 
they involve risks  uncertainties some of which are beyond the company control and assumptions 
management believes that these forward looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions 
many factors could affect the company actual financial results and cause them to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements 
these factors include  among other things  risk factors described from time to time in the company reports to the securities and exchange commission  as well as future economic and market circumstances  industry conditions  company performance and financial results  operating efficiencies  availability and price of raw materials  availability and market acceptance of new products  product pricing  domestic and international competitive environments  and actions and policy changes of domestic and foreign governments 
the following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
general in the fourth quarter of  we reorganized our segment reporting structure to reflect our management structure as a result of the acquisition of delta plc 
the main business units of delta are organized as follows in our segment structure engineered infrastructure products previously referred to as engineered support structures segment includes delta lighting  communication  access systems and roadway safety products  coatings segment includes delta galvanizing operations in the us  australia and asia  delta forged steel grinding media and electrolytic manganese dioxide operations are included an other  and  delta management administration expenses are included in net corporate expense

table of contents results of operations fiscal compared with fiscal acquisition of delta plc on march   we made an offer to acquire all the ordinary shares of delta plc delta  a public company traded on the london stock exchange under the symbol dlta 
the offer price was per ordinary share  with a total estimated purchase price of million 
to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with the offer  we executed a forward foreign exchange contract with a multinational bank  whereby  if the acquisition was completed  the required british pound sterling would be delivered to us at a fixed exchange rate of to complete the acquisition 
in accordance with takeover rules in the united kingdom  we established funding for the purchase price and related acquisition costs by a combination of million in restricted cash comprised of cash balances of million and million in borrowings under our revolving credit agreement and a million bank bridge loan commitment 
in april  we issued million of senior unsecured notes  terminated the bridge loan and reduced our revolving credit agreement borrowings to approximately million 
we completed the acquisition on may  and we now own of delta ordinary shares 
in december  we acquired all of delta preference shares for approximately million approximately million 
we began consolidating delta financial results in our consolidated financial statements on may  delta sales included in our consolidated results for the period of may  to december  were million 
delta operating income over the same period was million and includes approximately million of expenses related to amortization  depreciation and other items related to purchase accounting adjustments 
at december   we recast our reportable segments to align with our management reporting structure  as a result of this reorganization  delta galvanizing operations in the us  asia and australia are reported as part of our coatings segment  engineered steel products operations for structures and access systems are reported as part of the engineered infrastructure products segment  grinding media and manganese dioxide operations are reported as other  and head office administration expenses including expenses associated with the delta pension plan are reported as part of net corporate expense 
in fiscal  certain other expenses were incurred in our consolidated statement of operations that were associated with the delta acquisition 
these expenses included sg a expenses of million related to acquisition costs such as investment banking fees  due diligence costs and other expenses directly associated with the acquisition and integration of delta with valmont 
these costs  under applicable accounting standards  are required to be recorded as expenses as incurred 
interest expenses aggregating million incurred in fiscal related to fees and expenses to establish the bridge loan and borrowing costs incurred to finance the acquisition prior to the may  acquisition date 
the after tax impact of these expenses on our net earnings in fiscal was approximately million 

table of contents overview on a consolidated basis  the net sales increase in fiscal  as compared with  was mainly due to the acquisition of delta  which contributed million in net sales beginning may   improved sales unit volumes in the irrigation and coatings segments  and lower sales unit volumes and lower average selling prices in the engineered infrastructure products eip and utility support structure utility segments  for the company as a whole  without consideration of delta sales  our fiscal sales unit volumes were approximately lower as compared with on a reportable segment basis  the most significant sales unit volume decrease was in the utility segment  offset somewhat by increased unit sales volumes in the irrigation and coatings segments 
lower unit sales prices and unfavorable sales mix also contributed the lower net sales in  as compared with sales price decreases in  as compared with  resulted from a combination of weaker sales demand and increased price competition in most of our businesses 
the gross profit margin gross profit as a percent of sales in was lower than this decrease in gross profit margins were mainly due to lower gross margins in the utility and eip segments  where we were impacted by lower sales volumes  a more competitive pricing environment and an unfavorable sales mix 
the impact of these factors on gross profit margins was offset to a degree by lower average raw material costs in  as compared with rising raw material prices also resulted in million in lifo expense in  as compared with a million lifo benefit in on a reportable segment basis  we realized higher lifo expense in the eip million  irrigation million and utility million segments in  as compared with selling  general and administrative sg a spending in fiscal  as compared with  increased due to the following factors expenses associated with the delta acquisition and integration of approximately million 
these expenses were related to investment banking fees  due diligence costs and other direct costs associated with the acquisition and the integration of delta operations 
these expenses are reported as part of general corporate expense  delta sg a expenses from may  to december  of million  were included in consolidated sg a expenses 
these increases were somewhat offset by lower employee incentive expenses in  as compared with approximately million  lower sales commissions related to lower net sales in  as compared with approximately million 
in the aggregate  exclusive of the sg a expenses related to delta operations and its expenses incidental to its acquisition  sg a spending was down approximately million in fiscal  as compared with on a reportable segment basis  the eip and utility segments reported lower operating income and the irrigation and coatings segments reported higher operating income in the fiscal  as compared with the increase in net interest expense in fiscal  as compared with  was mainly due to interest associated with the million in senior unsecured notes issued in april and approximately million of bank fees incurred in related to providing the required bridge loan funding commitment for the delta acquisition 
other income was lower in fiscal  as compared with  mainly due to lower investment income related to our non qualified deferred compensation plan this year approximately million and foreign currency transaction gains incurred in that did not repeat in 
table of contents the increase in the effective income tax rate in fiscal  as compared with  was mainly due to the non deductibility of a portion of the delta acquisition expenses incurred in our cash flows provided by operations were approximately million in  as compared with million in lower net earnings in  as compared with  and the significant decrease in inventories in were the main reasons for the lower operating cash flow in engineered infrastructure products eip segment the increase in net sales in fiscal  as compared with  was mainly due the acquisition of delta engineered access systems  poles and highway safety products approximately million  offset to a degree by to lower sales volumes and lower sales prices in the lighting and communication structures product lines 
in the lighting traffic and roadway safety product line  we experienced lower sales and average unit selling prices in north american and international markets in  as compared with the decrease in north american sales in  as compared with  was due to weaker customer demand for lighting and traffic poles in the transportation market channel 
sales unit volumes in north america in were slightly lower as compared with we believe sales demand in the transportation market was dampened by the lack of a long term federal highway funding legislation and state budget deficits  as the lack of long term funding legislation does not give the various states ample visibility to implement long term initiatives 
furthermore  highway spending sponsored under the federal program requires the various states to provide part of required funding 
many states are in budget deficits  which may constrain their ability to access federal matching funds to implement roadway projects 
while commercial lighting market sales in were slightly higher as compared with  demand remains relatively weak  due to continued softness in the commercial and residential construction markets 
in europe  sales were lower in  as compared with as most economies in europe are weak  governments have cut spending including for infrastructure projects to cope with budgetary deficits 
the decrease in european lighting sales in  as compared with  was also related to competitive selling price pressures and certain project sales in developing markets in that did not repeat in lighting structure sales in china  while a relatively small portion of global lighting sales  improved in  as compared with  due to increased sales efforts 
sales in the communication structures product line were lower in fiscal  as compared with  in both north america and china 
in north america  general slowness in the wireless communication structures market and lower sign structure sales resulted in lower sales  as compared with in china  sales of wireless communication structures likewise were lower in  as compared with in  annual supply contracts with the various carriers were settled later than in the past and we believe there is some continuing coordination of the wireless networks in china that is impacting network development at this time 
operating income in the eip segment was higher in fiscal  as compared with  due the impact of the delta infrastructure businesses approximately million  offset somewhat by lower lighting and wireless communication sales volumes and pricing pressures due to weak market conditions 
the impact of lower sales on operating profit was mitigated to an extent by factory operational improvements approximately million 
while lifo expense for the segment was higher in fiscal  as compared with  by approximately million  this impact was largely offset by lower average material costs incurred in  as compared with aside from the impact of the delta acquisition  sg a expenses were approximately million lower in  as compared with  due to various cost containment actions in the segment this year 
utility support structures utility segment in the utility segment  the sales decrease in  as compared with  was due to the combination of lower sales unit volumes in the us and lower average unit selling prices 
the decrease in unit sales in tons in fiscal in the us was approximately 
the record sales performance 
table of contents realized in was in part related to the large backlog at the end of the fiscal year  which was the result of substantial order intake in the last half of at the end of fiscal  our sales order backlog was less than half of the year end backlog 
during and continuing into  the economic recession in the us resulted in a drop in electricity demand 
accordingly  our customers reduced their purchases of structures and delayed scheduled projects 
in addition  price competition became more significant  especially in light of falling steel prices throughout most of and generally lower levels of transmission and substation spending this year by utility companies 
we believe that utility companies invested at lower levels due to a combination of some falling electricity consumption in the us during the recession and uncertainty that they would generate an adequate financial return on transmission and substation investments 
in international markets  sales improved over  the result of increased project sales into new markets  offset by lower sales volumes in china 
the decrease in operating income in  as compared with  was a result of lower sales volumes  lower average selling prices and an unfavorable sales mix 
operating profit also was negatively impacted by million in increased lifo expense in  as compared with the decrease in sg a expenses in  as compared with  primarily resulted from lower employee incentives related to the decrease in operating income this year approximately million and lower sales commission expense approximately million due to the decrease in net sales this year 
coatings segment net sales in the coatings segment increased in fiscal  as compared with  resulted mainly from the inclusion of delta galvanizing sales in this segment approximately million and improved sales unit volumes 
galvanizing unit volumes in were approximately higher in as compared with in we attribute the increase in sales demand to slightly stronger industrial economic conditions in our geographic market areas 
the increase in segment operating income in  as compared with  was due to the impact of delta galvanizing operations approximately million and improved sales volumes and the associated operating leverage 
these effects were offset somewhat by rising zinc costs that were not recovered through sales price increases 
increases in the average cost of zinc in  as compared with  amounted to approximately million 
these cost increases were largely offset by factory efficiencies and increased sales volume 
sg a expenses for the segment in were higher as compared with  mainly due to the impact of delta galvanizing operations 
irrigation segment irrigation segment net sales in improved  as compared with  due to stronger sales volumes in north america and international markets and currency translation effects on international sales approximately million 
in north america  we believe improved demand for irrigation equipment in over a weak resulted from improvement in grower sentiment and expected net farm income 
in international markets  the sales improvement in over was broad based  as stronger market conditions drove higher sales in most regions 
operating income for the segment improved in over  due to improved sales unit volumes in north america  lower raw material prices net of increased lifo expense of million and a stronger international sales mix 
sg a expenses increased mainly due to increased employee incentives associated with improved operating income approximately million and costs associated with business development activities 

table of contents other this unit mainly includes our tubing and industrial and fasteners operations and the delta grinding media and manganese dioxide operations 
the increase in sales and operating income in  as compared with  primarily was due to the delta businesses acquired approximately million and million  respectively and improved sales demand for tubing products 
net corporate expense net corporate expense increased in  as compared with  as expenses included expenses associated with the acquisition of delta approximately million  administrative expenses associated with delta of million including approximately million of pension plan expenses 
these expense increases were offset somewhat by lower employee incentive accruals in of million and other decreases in discretionary spending 
fiscal compared with fiscal overview net sales the decrease in fiscal net sales  as compared fiscal  was mainly due to lower unit sales volumes in  as compared with on a consolidated basis  sales unit volumes for fiscal were approximately less than in on a reportable segment basis  we realized a significant sales unit volume increase in the utility support structures utility segment  driven largely by substantial investment by us utility customers to improve their electrical transmission capacity and reliability 
the sales unit volume increase in utility was more than offset by lower unit sales volumes in our other reportable segments 
we believe these decreases were mainly due to the global economic recession that began in late and persisted throughout this economic weakness  especially in the us and europe  resulted in lower sales demand in the ess  irrigation and coatings segments 
sales demand in the irrigation segment was also adversely impacted by lower net farm income in  as compared with the net sales volume decrease was offset to a degree by the full year impact of acquisitions completed in approximately million 
average unit selling prices were slightly higher in  as compared with  due to steel cost increases that occurred throughout most of and reflected in sales shipments in throughout  pricing levels generally decreased as compared with late  due to pricing pressures associated with weaker sales demand and lower raw material prices 
gross profit margins gross profit margin gross profit as a percent of sales increased in fiscal  as compared with  despite generally lower sales volumes 
on a consolidated basis  this improvement was largely due to declining raw materials prices especially steel throughout on a segment basis  the utility segment realized significantly improved gross profit margins due to its significant sales volume increase in  as compared with in our other reportable segments  aggressive manufacturing cost control helped us maintain gross margins to some degree despite weaker sales demand and lower factory production levels 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a spending in increased as compared with due to increased salary and benefit costs approximately million  the full year effect of acquisitions completed in approximately million  and  increased deferred compensation expense related to the improved investment performance in the marketable securities underlying the deferred compensation plan as compared with of approximately million 
we recorded the related investment gains in these securities as other in our condensed consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal year ended december  these increases were somewhat offset by currency translation effects approximately million  lower management incentive accruals in  as compared with approximately million  and  lower sales commissions due to lower sales in  as compared with approximately million 
the decrease in net interest expense for fiscal year ended december   as compared with  was due to a combination of lower interest rates on our variable rate debt in and decreased borrowing levels throughout other income was higher in the fiscal year ended december   as compared with  due to improved investment performance in the assets in our deferred compensation plan approximately million and foreign currency transaction gains realized in the effective income tax rate in fiscal was slightly lower than  due to a reduction in our income tax contingency liabilities and the realization of additional income tax benefits in certain international tax jurisdictions in our cash flows provided by operations were million for the fiscal year ended december   as compared with million in fiscal improved net earnings and working capital management in  as compared with  were the main reasons for the improved operating cash flow in engineered infrastructure products eip segment formerly known as the engineered support structures segment the decrease in ess segment sales for the fiscal year ended december   as compared with fiscal  was mainly due to weaker sales demand in worldwide markets 
foreign currency translation effects approximately million also contributed to the decrease in segment sales 
these decreases were offset somewhat by the impact of acquisitions approximately million 
in north america  lighting and traffic structure sales were lower than levels due to decreased demand for lighting and traffic control support structures 
in particular  sales demand for lighting structures for residential and commercial outdoor lighting applications were lower in  as compared with  due to weaker residential and commercial construction activity that resulted from the global economic recession and tightness in credit markets 
net sales in the transportation market channel likewise were lower in as compared with in addition to the recession in the us economy  we believe that state budget deficits and uncertainty over the us federal highway funding legislation also contributed to weaker sales order flows and shipments in we believe that the lack of 
table of contents legislative activity on long term street and highway funding is negatively impacting street and highway project activity  because the amount and nature of any funding is uncertain 
we also believe that the impact from the us economic stimulus spending directed towards street and highway construction projects is not substantial  aside from some potential positive impact of financial aid provided to the various states  which could be used to fund street and highway construction projects 
in europe  sales for the fiscal year ended december  were comparable to the positive impact from the mitas and stainton acquisitions in late largely offset lower sales demand in our core markets due to economic weakness in europe and currency translation effects 
sales of specialty structures products in fiscal were lower than in north america  market conditions for sales of structures and components for the wireless communication market in were lower than  reflecting less aggressive wireless network enhancement activity by the major wireless carriers 
sales of wireless communication poles in china in were comparable to sales of sign structure products in were lower than  as this product line is being discontinued 
these sales decreases were offset to a degree by the acquisition of site pro site pro in july the decrease in operating income in the eip segment for fiscal was largely due to the decrease in sales volumes 
the lower raw material costs  operational improvements including employment and capacity reductions and the impact of acquisitions approximately million helped mitigate the operating income impact associated with lower sales 
segment sg a expense for the fiscal year ended december  was comparable with fiscal  as the impact from acquisitions approximately million and impairment charges incurred in the third quarter as part of our evaluation of the goodwill and other intangible assets assigned to our north american sign structure operations approximately million were offset somewhat by currency translation impacts approximately million and lower sales commissions associated with lower sales volumes approximately million 
utility support structures utility segment in the utility segment  the sales increase in fiscal  as compared with  was due to strong sales volume increases in steel and concrete high voltage transmission and substation structures and higher average sales prices 
we entered the fiscal year with a record backlog and the strong sales performance relates in part to the large backlog from year end in the us  our customers  who are mainly utility companies  are continuing their investment commitments in transmission and substation structures which began over the past several years to improve the reliability and capacity of the electrical grid in the us sales demand for pole structures for low voltage electrical distribution applications was weaker in  as compared with this weakness relates directly to the downturn in residential and commercial construction in the us that started in late due to the economic recession and credit crisis 
in international markets  sales volumes were higher  due mainly to project sales in developing countries 
order rates in the us in for transmission and substation structures lagged the record order rates in we believe that utility companies postponed transmission structure spending due to the economic recession in the us as a result  the sales backlog at the end of is much lower than at december sales of utility structures in china in fiscal were comparable to fiscal the improved operating income in fiscal  as compared with  related to the increased sales levels  improved operating leverage associated with higher sales volumes  lower raw material costs and a more favorable sales mix than the increase in sg a spending in  as compared with  was principally due to higher salary and employee benefit costs million  higher employee incentives approximately million associated with improved operating income of this segment and additional costs associated with developing international markets for our utility structures 

table of contents coatings segment the decrease in coatings segment sales in the fiscal year ended december  as compared with was predominantly due to decreased sales volumes from both internal and external customers along with lower selling prices due to lower per pound zinc costs in  as compared with the sales volumes in our galvanizing operations for the fiscal year ended december  was approximately lower than fiscal the decrease in sales demand was related to industrial economic conditions in our served markets due to the us economic recession 
operating income decreased in fiscal  as compared with  mainly the result of lower unit sales demand 
the impact of lower sales volumes was mitigated by cost reductions in factory operations and lower natural gas prices in sg a spending in fiscal was comparable to  as the impact of an acquisition completed in the fourth quarter of and higher employee compensation costs were offset by lower management incentive expense 
irrigation segment the sales decrease in the irrigation segment for the fiscal year ended december   as compared with the same period in  was mainly due to weaker sales volumes in both domestic and international markets 
in  lower farm commodity prices and net farm income in worldwide agricultural markets  as compared with  resulted in decreased demand for mechanized irrigation machines in global markets 
in addition  we believe that the global economic recession and an uncertain outlook for world economies caused customers to delay capital investments in irrigation technology in in international irrigation markets  the sales decrease in  as compared with  was broad based across most geographic markets 
in both north american and international markets  average selling prices were slightly lower than last year  due to price competition in our various markets and lower raw material prices 
currency translation effects also contributed to lower irrigation segment sales for the fiscal year ended december   as compared with approximately million 
the decrease in operating income for the fiscal year ended december   as compared with fiscal  was due to the effect of lower sales unit volumes and the associated operating deleverage realized as a result of lower sales and production levels 
the decrease in sg a spending in fiscal  as compared with  was due to lower incentive expense accruals related to decreased operating income this year approximately million and currency translation effects approximately million  offset somewhat by higher salary and employee benefits costs approximately million 
other these businesses mainly include our tubing and industrial fastener operations 
the decreases in sales and operating income in fiscal  as compared with  mainly related to weaker sales of industrial tubing due to the economic recession in the us this year 
net corporate expense the increase in net corporate expense for the fiscal year ended december   as compared with fiscal  were mainly due to increased deferred compensation liabilities related to higher investment returns on the assets of the deferred compensation plan approximately million  which is recorded in sg a expenses 
the investment gains and losses were recorded in miscellaneous in our condensed consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal years ended december  and december   respectively  and  
table of contents increased employee incentive expense in fiscal  as compared with approximately million 
the increased incentive expense was principally due to improvement in our common stock price in  which resulted in higher recorded expense in our long term incentive plan 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows working capital and operating cash flows net working capital was million at december   as compared with million at december  the increase in net working capital in mainly resulted from the delta acquisition of million  offset to a degree by cash on hand used to fund part of the delta acquisition 
operating cash flow was million in fiscal  as compared with million in the decrease in operating cash flow in mainly was the result of lower net earnings  as compared with and the significant cash flow generated in through inventory reductions 
accounts receivable turnover in was comparable with investing cash flows capital spending in was million  as compared with million in we expect our capital spending for the fiscal year to be approximately million 
investing cash flows for fiscal included million related to delta  net of cash on delta balance sheet at may  and an aggregate of approximately million associated with increasing our ownership interest in west coast engineering  ltd 
from to  acquiring the remaining of our polish poles manufacturing operation and the additional purchase price paid to the former shareholders of stainton related to the performance of the operation after its acquisition in november investing cash flows in also included million in proceeds from the sale of a discontinued delta manganese dioxide site 
financing cash flows our total interest bearing debt increased from million at december  to million as of december  the increase in borrowings in was predominantly associated with the million of senior unsecured notes and borrowings under our revolving credit agreement to finance a portion of the delta acquisition 
sources of financing and capital we have historically funded our growth  capital spending and acquisitions through a combination of operating cash flows and debt financing 
we have an internal long term objective to maintain long term debt as a percent of invested capital at or below 
at december   our long term debt to invested capital ratio was  as compared with at december  subject to our level of acquisition activity and steel industry operating conditions which could affect the levels of inventory we need to fulfill customer commitments  we plan to maintain this ratio below in our debt financing at december  consisted primarily of long term debt 
we also maintain certain short term bank lines of credit totaling million  million of which was unused at december  our long term debt principally consists of million of senior subordinated notes that bear interest at per annum and are due in may these notes are guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries 
we are allowed to 
table of contents repurchase all or a portion of the notes at the following redemption prices stated as a percentage of face value redemption price until may  from may  until may  after may  million of senior unsecured notes that bear interest at per annum and are due in april we are allowed to repurchase the notes at specified prepayment premiums 
these notes are guaranteed by the same subsidiaries as our senior subordinated notes 
million revolving credit agreement with a group of banks 
we may increase the credit facility by up to an additional million at any time  subject to participating banks increasing the amount of their lending commitments 
the interest rate on our borrowings will be  at our option  either a libor based on a   or month interest period  as selected by us plus to basis points inclusive of facility fees  depending on our ratio of debt to earnings before taxes  interest  depreciation and amortization ebitda  or  b the higher of the higher of a the prime lending rate and b the federal funds rate plus basis points plus in each case  to basis points inclusive of facility fees  depending on our ratio of debt to ebitda  or libor based on a week interest period plus to basis points inclusive of facility fees  depending on our ratio of debt to ebitda at december   we had million in outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit agreement  at an annual interest rate of  not including facility fees 
these outstanding borrowings were associated with funding requirements related to the delta acquisition 
the revolving credit agreement has a termination date of october  and contains certain financial covenants that may limit our additional borrowing capability under the agreement 
at december   we had the ability to borrow an additional million under this facility 
these debt agreements contain covenants that require us to maintain certain coverage ratios and may limit us with respect to certain business activities  including capital expenditures 
our key debt covenants are that interest bearing debt is not to exceed x ebitda of the prior four quarters and that our ebitda over our prior four quarters must be at least x our interest expense over the same period 
at december   we were in compliance with all covenants related to these debt agreements 
the key covenant calculations at december  were as follows including delta on a pro forma basis  as per our covenants interest bearing debt ebitda last months leverage ratio x ebitda last months interest expense last months interest earned ratio x 
table of contents the calculation of pro forma ebitda is as follows net cash flows from operations interest expense income tax expense deferred income tax expense benefit noncontrolling interest equity in earnings losses in nonconsolidated subsidiaries stock based compensation pension plan expense payment of deferred compensation changes in assets and liabilities  net of acquisitions delta plc ebitda january  may  other ebitda our businesses are cyclical  but we have diversity in our markets  from a product  customer and a geographical standpoint 
we have demonstrated the ability to effectively manage through business cycles and maintain liquidity 
we have consistently generated operating cash flows in excess of our capital expenditures 
based on our available credit facilities  recent issuance of senior unsecured notes and our history of positive operational cash flows  we believe that we have adequate liquidity to meet our needs 
a significant portion of our cash balances are outside the united states 
we have not made any provision for us income taxes in our financial statements on approximately million of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries  as we intend to reinvest those earnings 
therefore  if we need to repatriate foreign cash balances to the united states to meet our cash needs  income taxes would be paid to the extent that those cash repatriations were undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries 
financial obligations and financial commitments we have future financial obligations related to payment of principal and interest on interest bearing debt  delta pension plan contributions  operating leases and purchase obligations 
these obligations at december  were as follows in millions of dollars contractual obligations total after long term debt interest delta pension plan contributions operating leases unconditional purchase commitments total contractual cash obligations long term debt principally consisted of million of senior subordinated notes and million of senior unsecured notes 
at december   we had million of outstanding borrowings under our bank revolving credit agreement 
we also had various other borrowing arrangements aggregating million at december  obligations under these agreements may accelerate in event of non compliance with covenants 
the delta pension plan contributions are related to agreed upon cash funding commitments to the plan with the plan trustees  which are re negotiated 
table of contents in conjunction with a triennial valuation 
operating leases relate mainly to various production and office facilities and are in the normal course of business 
unconditional purchase obligations relate to purchase orders for zinc  aluminum and steel  all of which we plan to use in  and certain capital investments planned for we believe the quantities under contract are reasonable in light of normal fluctuations in business levels and we expect to use the commodities under contract during the contract period 
at december   we had approximately million of various long term liabilities related to certain income tax  environmental and other matters 
these items are not scheduled above because we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to the timing of any potential payments 
off balance sheet arrangements we have operating lease obligations to unaffiliated parties on leases of certain production and office facilities and equipment 
these leases are in the normal course of business and generally contain no substantial obligations for us at the end of the lease contracts 
we also have certain commercial commitments related to contingent events that could create a financial obligation for us 
our commitments at december  were as follows in millions of dollars commitment expiration period other commercial commitments total amounts committed thereafter standby letters of credit total commercial commitments the above commitment is a loan guarantee of a non consolidated subsidiary in argentina that is accompanied by a guarantee from the majority owner to us 
we also maintain standby letters of credit for contract performance on certain sales contracts 
market risk changes in prices certain key materials we use are commodities traded in worldwide markets and are subject to fluctuations in price 
the most significant materials are steel  aluminum  zinc and natural gas 
over the last several years  prices for these commodities have been volatile 
the volatility in these prices was due to such factors as fluctuations in supply and demand conditions  government tariffs and the costs of steel making inputs 
we have also experienced volatility in natural gas prices in the past several years 
our main strategies in managing these risks are a combination of fixed price purchase contracts with our vendors to reduce the volatility in our purchase prices and sales price increases where possible 
we use natural gas swap contracts on a limited basis to mitigate the impact of rising gas prices on our operating income 
risk management market risk the principal market risks affecting us are exposure to interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and natural gas 
we normally do not use derivative financial instruments to hedge these exposures except as described below  nor do we use derivatives for trading purposes 
interest rates our interest bearing debt at december  was mostly fixed rate debt 
our notes payable and a small portion of our long term debt accrue interest at a variable rate 
assuming average interest rates and borrowings on variable rate debt  a hypothetical change in interest rates would have impacted our would have impacted our interest expense in and by approximately 
table of contents million and million  respectively 
likewise  we have excess cash balances on deposit in interest bearing accounts in financial institutions 
an increase or decrease in interest rates of would have impacted our annual interest earnings in by approximately million foreign exchange exposures to transactions denominated in a currency other than the entity functional currency are not material  and therefore the potential exchange losses in future earnings  fair value and cash flows from these transactions are not material 
from time to time  as market conditions indicate  we will enter into foreign currency contracts to manage the risks associated with forecasted transactions and balance sheet positions that are in currencies other than the functional currencies of our operations 
much of our cash in non us entities is denominated in foreign currencies  where fluctuations in exchange rates will impact our cash balances in us dollar terms 
a hypothetical change in the value of the us dollar would impact our reported cash balance by approximately million in and million in we manage our investment risk in foreign operations by borrowing in the functional currencies of the foreign entities where appropriate 
the following table indicates the change in the recorded value of our most significant investments at year end assuming a hypothetical change in the value of the us dollar 
in millions australian dollar chinese renminbi euro uk pound brazilian real commodity risk natural gas is a significant commodity used in our factories  especially in our coatings segment galvanizing operations  where natural gas is used to heat tanks that enable the hot dipped galvanizing process 
natural gas prices are volatile and we mitigate some of this volatility through the use of derivative commodity instruments 
our current policy is to manage this commodity price risk for of our us natural gas requirements for the upcoming months through the purchase of natural gas swaps based on nymex futures prices for delivery in the month being hedged 
the objective of this policy is to mitigate the impact on our earnings of sudden  significant increases in the price of natural gas 
at december   our open natural gas contracts were not significant 
critical accounting policies the following accounting policies involve judgments and estimates used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
there is a substantial amount of management judgment used in preparing financial statements 
we must make estimates on a number of items  such as provisions for bad debts  warranties  contingencies  impairments of long lived assets  and inventory obsolescence 
we base our estimates on our experience and on other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
further  we re evaluate our estimates from time to time and as circumstances change 
actual results may differ under different assumptions or conditions 
the selection and application of our critical accounting policies are discussed annually with our audit committee 
allowance for doubtful accounts in determining an allowance for accounts receivable that will not ultimately be collected in full  we consider age of the accounts receivable customer credit history 
table of contents customer financial information reasons for non payment product  service or billing issues 
if our customers financial condition was to deteriorate  resulting in an impaired ability to make payment  additional allowances may be required 
warranties all of our businesses must meet certain product quality and performance criteria 
we rely on historical product claims data to estimate the cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
in determining the accrual for the estimated cost of warranty claims  we consider our experience with costs to correct the product problem in the field  including labor costs costs for replacement parts other direct costs associated with warranty claims the number of product units subject to warranty claims in addition to known claims or warranty issues  we estimate future claims on recent sales 
the key assumptions in our estimates are the rates we apply to those recent sales which is based on historical claims experience and our expected future warranty costs for products that are covered under warranty for an extended period of time 
our provision for various product warranties was approximately million at december  if our estimate changed by  the impact on operating income would be approximately million 
if our cost to repair a product or the number of products subject to warranty claims is greater than we estimated  then we would have to increase our accrued cost for warranty claims 
inventories we use the last in first out lifo method to determine the value approximately of our inventory 
the remaining of our inventory is valued on a first in first out fifo basis 
in periods of rising costs to produce inventory  the lifo method will result in lower profits than fifo  because higher more recent costs are recorded to cost of goods sold than under the fifo method 
conversely  in periods of falling costs to produce inventory  the lifo method will result in higher profits than the fifo method 
in and  we experienced higher costs to produce inventory than in the prior respective years  due mainly to higher cost for steel and steel related products 
this resulted in higher cost of goods sold and lower operating income in and of approximately million and million  respectively  than had our entire inventory been valued on the fifo method 
in  prices decreased and operating income would have decreased by approximately million than had our entire inventory been valued on the fifo method 
we write down slow moving and obsolete inventory by the difference between the value of the inventory and our estimate of the reduced value based on potential future uses  the likelihood that overstocked inventory will be sold and the expected selling prices of the inventory 
if our ability to realize value on slow moving or obsolete inventory is less favorable than assumed  additional inventory write downs may be required 

table of contents depreciation  amortization and impairment of long lived assets our long lived assets consist primarily of property  plant and equipment  goodwill and intangible assets acquired in business acquisitions 
we have assigned useful lives to our property  plant and equipment and certain intangible assets ranging from to years 
we identified eight reporting units for purposes of evaluating goodwill and we annually evaluate our reporting units for goodwill impairment during the third fiscal quarter  which usually coincides with our strategic planning process 
with respect to the delta acquisition  we carried forward the fair value calculations of the acquired reporting units as of the may  acquisition date and did not test them for impairment in the third quarter of  as no impairment indicators were present 
we assess the value of our reporting units using after tax cash flows from operations less capital expenses discounted to present value and as a multiple of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
the key assumptions in the discounted cash flow analysis are the discount rate and the annual free cash flow 
we also use sensitivity analysis to determine the impact of changes in discount rates and cash flow forecasts on the valuation of the reporting units 
as allowed for under current accounting standards  we rely on our previous valuations for the annual impairment testing provided that the following criteria for each reporting unit are met the assets and liabilities that make up the reporting unit have not changed significantly since the most recent fair value determination and the most recent fair value determination resulted in an amount that exceeded the carrying amount of the reporting unit by a substantial margin 
the valuation of most of our reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values by a substantial margin  except the north american communication reporting unit  which has goodwill of million and an excess of fair value over carrying value of million 
accordingly  no further valuation of our reporting units was necessary 
if our assumptions on discount rates and future cash flows change as a result of events or circumstances  and we believe these assets may have declined in value  then we may record impairment charges  resulting in lower profits 
our reporting units are all cyclical and their sales and profitability may fluctuate from year to year 
in the evaluation of our reporting units  we look at the long term prospects for the reporting unit and recognize that current performance may not be the best indicator of future prospects or value  which requires management judgment 
our indefinite lived intangible assets consist of trade names 
we assess the values of these assets apart from goodwill as part of the annual impairment testing 
we use the relief from royalty method to evaluate our trade names  under which the value of a trade name is determined based on a royalty that could be charged to a third party for using the trade name in question 
the royalty  which is based on a reasonable rate applied against forecasted sales  is tax effected and discounted to present value 
the most significant assumptions in this evaluation include estimated future sales  the royalty rate and the after tax discount rate 
for our evaluation purposes  the royalty rates used vary between and of sales and the after tax discount rate of  which we estimate to be the after tax cost of capital for such assets 
in  impairment charges of million were recorded in connection with our decision to discontinue the use of a trade name for sign structures 
in the fourth quarter of  we completed our evaluation of the pirod trade name  by reviewing with management the valuation assumptions and future business plans associated with the trade name and concluded that the value of the trade name million was not impaired 
income taxes we record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized 
we consider future taxable income expectations and tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
if we estimate a deferred tax asset is not likely to be fully realized in the future  a valuation allowance to decrease the amount of the deferred tax asset 
table of contents would decrease net earnings in the period the determination was made 
likewise  if we subsequently determine that we are able to realize all or part of a net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment reducing the valuation allowance would increase net earnings in the period such determination was made 
at december   we had approximately million in deferred tax assets relating mainly to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards  with a valuation allowance of million 
in  both the deferred tax assets as well as the valuation allowances increased significantly 
this was due to the acquisition of delta and did not have an impact on our income tax expense 
at december   delta had million of deferred tax assets relating mainly to operating losses and million of deferred tax assets associated with its defined benefit pension liability 
because the realization of these deferred tax assets is not likely at this time  we have established a valuation allowance of million 
excluding the valuation allowances related to delta  valmont had an increase of million in valuation allowances that increased our income tax expense during in  we reduced our valuation allowances by net million  resulting in a decrease in our income tax expense of approximately million 
this changes occurred because we determined that  based on facts and circumstances  the realization of these deferred tax assets was more likely than not 
in  the most significant decrease in our valuation allowances that affected our income tax expense related to the realization of operating loss carryforwards due to the strong performance of our mexican utility support structures operation 
if circumstances related to our deferred tax assets change in the future  we may be required to increase or decrease the valuation allowance on these assets  resulting in an increase or decrease in income tax expense and a reduction or increase in net income 
we have not made any us income tax provision in our financial statements for a certain amount of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries  as we intend to reinvest those earnings 
if circumstances change and we determine that we are not permanently invested  we would need to record an income tax expense on our financial statements for the resulting income tax that would be paid upon repatriation 
we are subject to examination by taxing authorities in the various countries in which we operate 
the tax years subject to examination vary by jurisdiction 
we regularly consider the likelihood of additional income tax assessments in each of these taxing jurisdictions based on our experiences related to prior audits and our understanding of the facts and circumstances of the related tax issues 
we include in current income tax expense any changes to accruals for potential tax deficiencies 
if our judgments related to tax deficiencies differ from our actual experience  our income tax expense could increase or decrease in a given fiscal period 
pension benefits delta ltd 
maintains a defined benefit pension plan for qualifying employees in the united kingdom 
independent actuaries assist in properly measuring the liabilities and expenses associated with accounting for pension benefits to eligible employees 
in order to use actuarial methods to value the liabilities and expenses  we must make several assumptions 
the critical assumptions used to measure pension obligations and expenses are the discount rate and expected rate of return on pension assets 
we evaluate our critical assumptions at least annually 
key assumptions are based on the following factors discount rate is based on an annualized yield on the iboxx over year aa rated bond index 
expected return on plan assets is based on our asset allocation mix and our historical return  taking into consideration current and expected market conditions 
most of the assets in the pension plan are invested in corporate bonds  the expected return of which are estimated based on risk free bonds gilts in the uk  plus a risk premium of to basis points 
the long term expected returns on equities are based on historic performance over the long term 

table of contents inflation is based on the estimated change in the consumer price index cpi 
in the past  this assumption was normally based on changes in the retail price index rpi and usually is higher than cpi 
recent changes in uk pension law allow the use of cpi in the calculation of pension benefits for deferred members and we incorporated this into our pension calculations at december  in the event that we are required to use rpi in our pension calculations  there would be an increase in the pension liability of approximately million 
the following tables present the key assumptions used to measure pension expense for and the estimated impact on pension expense relative to a change in those assumptions assumptions pension discount rate expected return on plan assets inflation assumptions in millions of dollars increase in pension expense decrease in discount rate decrease in expected return on plan assets increase in inflation item a
