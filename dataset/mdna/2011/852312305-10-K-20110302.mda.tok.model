you should read the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements of staar  including the related notes  provided in this report 
overview strategy staar s strategy is to be valued as a leading global provider of innovative intraocular lens system technologies 
staar employs a commercialization strategy that focuses on achieving sustainable profitable growth 
performance against key operational metrics two overriding strategic goals guided staar s key operational metrics in to generate a profit in and to lay the groundwork for sustainable profitability into the future 
in pursuit of these goals  staar aligned its principal business initiatives during along the following five key operational metrics  which staar has also used to gauge its progress during the year achievement of double digit percentage growth in sales from core icl and iol products  improvement in gross profit margins to the mid level  progress toward profitability throughout the year  with a goal of achieving net income for the full year  continued generation of cash flow from operations  and improvement in financial condition by retiring obligations and strengthening the balance sheet 
in the following discussion we generally measure staar s performance based on results from continuing operations 
in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principals gaap  we account for our march  divestiture of domilens gmbh as discontinued operations in the first quarter of as a result  the reader can compare current results of staar s post divestiture business with the corresponding elements of our business in historical periods 
a more complete explanation of this reporting method may be found below under the heading effect of domilens divestiture on financial reporting 
double digit growth in sales from core icl and iol products 
developing  making and selling implantable lenses has always been staar s principal business  and staar believes that capitalizing on its expertise and reputation in the field presents its primary opportunity for growth 
as a result  staar regards icls and iols as its core products 
staar achieved approximately growth in worldwide icl sales during over the prior year 
during staar continued to focus its icl marketing and sales efforts in the key territories where it has established significant market share 
following the february  approval of the icl in japan  staar added japan to the list of targeted territories based on its potential market share 
japan has a higher rate of myopia than many other countries  which makes it a promising new market 
staar s post approval launch in japan has proceeded slowly because of the time required to train and certify surgeons on the visian icl product 
the key territories in which staar is currently seeking to enhance visian sales are the us  japan  korea  china  india  italy  spain  germany  uk and france 
since  staar has experienced a breakthrough in market penetration in korea  where it believes implants of visian products have exceeded of the total volume of refractive surgery procedures 
revenues from sales of visian icl products in korea increased during over because of the rapid growth of visian icl sales and market share in korea  staar is using korea as a model of best practices for marketing that may serve to significantly increase market share in other key territories 
us military forces currently represent the largest group of customers for visian icls in the us compared to military sales increased slightly during  while civilian sales decreased slightly 
surgeons affiliated with the us army have noted the benefits of the visian icl and have presented data based on military experience showing that icl provides superior visual outcomes to lasik  even in younger patients with relatively lower levels of myopia 
staar believes that the military s adoption of the visian icl will in the long term enhance demand for the lenses in the private sector 
staar  however  does not believe that private sector purchases of visian icls will resume growing significantly until consumer spending improves  which depends on continued recovery in the us economy 
overall  refractive procedures continue to be adversely affected by the economy  market scope reports that total refractive procedures dropped by approximately in the us during us visian icl unit sales decreased by in staar s initiatives to increase its us sales of icls are discussed in greater detail under the heading other highlights us icl sales below 
staar s ability to maintain or accelerate the rate of growth in visian icl sales will partly depend on continued improvement in worldwide economic conditions and progress with regulatory agencies 
icl surgery is a relatively expensive elective procedure and is seldom reimbursed by insurers or government agencies 
staar believes that the global recession reduced overall demand for refractive surgery  and it has been reported that consumer spending and consumer confidence has not returned to pre recession levels 
staar s global iol sales have also continued to increase  with sales in approximately higher than the prior year  due in part to the nanoflex  sales of which grew during sales of staar s preloaded iols  currently available only outside the us  increased by during the year driven by the launch of the ks x hydrophobic acrylic preloaded iol in new markets and continuing strong sales of preloaded silicone iols 
sales of preloaded iols represented of our total iol sales in fiscal a rise in us iol sales in the third quarter of marked the first time in four years that staar has increased its quarterly iol sales in the us  and only the second time in the last seven years 
while staar has been experiencing a general decline in us iol sales volume during the last several years  the rate of decline decreased following staar s introduction of aspheric iols with ntiol status in and  which resulted in higher average selling prices for staar s iols in the us through february  staar introduced three new products in the us in in pursuit of growth in its iol market the nanoflex iol  the nanopoint injection system  and the advanced epiphany injector for staar s three piece collamer aspheric lens 
staar believes its recent product introductions have given the company a more competitive iol product line with unique features and benefits  and offer an opportunity to regain lost iol market share both within and outside the us staar is seeking to obtain us food and drug administration fda approval to sell its silicone preloaded injectors in the us staar believes this product will further enhance its us iol offering and will help staar maintain or increase its market share in the silicone iol segment 
staar s initiatives to increase its us sales of iols are discussed in greater detail under the heading other highlights us iol sales below 
improvement in gross profit margins to the mid level for the year 
to achieve sustainable profitability  staar must not only increase its revenues but also increase the gross profit margin yielded by those revenues 
staar s gross profit margin was for compared to in this improvement primarily result from a decrease in royalty expense resulting from the expiration of a patent licensed to staar  increased sales of higher margin icls and iols  and decreased sales of other products 
those gains were partly offset by higher inventory provisions and by a one time charge of  in the third quarter due to issues related to a key raw material for the collamer material  which has been resolved 
these results represent a substantial increase over profit margins previously reported on a consolidated basis when staar s operations included its former german subsidiary  domilens gmbh 
the sale of domilens in the first quarter of removed some of the lowest gross profit margin sales from staar s product mix 
products sold by domilens are presented in discontinued operations  including third party products  supplies and disposables like surgical drapes  and assembly of custom surgical kits 
in contrast  staar s own products previously distributed to domilens will continue to be sold to domilens as an unaffiliated distributor 
those sales are therefore treated as continuing operations of staar and are included in net sales in staar s consolidated financial statements after the disposition  however  the volume of these sales has not been significant in relation to staar s consolidated net sales 
staar has further increased gross profit margin during through the following increasing icl sales as a percentage of staar s overall product mix 
visian icls and ticls generally yield gross profit margins in excess of 
the visian product line is staar s most profitable product family and the largest contributor to enhanced gross profit margins 
worldwide icl sales grew throughout  with fourth quarter sales in established markets further increased by our enhanced product offering in countries recognizing the ce mark 
increasing sales of higher value iols in the us in and staar began converting its us iol product offering from lower value legacy products to newer aspheric designs that yield higher average selling prices 
with the introduction of the nanoflex iol in  staar has introduced aspheric versions for both of its iol product platforms 
as staar s customers have switched to aspheric lenses  and new customers have begun purchasing the nanoflex iol in greater numbers  us iol gross profit margins have increased 
progress toward profitability throughout the year  with a goal of achieving income from continuing operations for the full year 
staar made progress toward profitability throughout  reducing its losses from continuing operations by to million  compared to million in although staar did achieve net income for the full year as a result of the divestiture of domilens  the company did not achieve income from continuing operations 
among the reasons staar did not achieve its goal of income from continuing operations for was expenses related to expanded sales and marketing staff  promotional activities  and severance costs which offset significant reductions in general and administrative spending 
staar believes that its investment in sales and marketing will begin to yield increases in sales in and help lead to sustainable profitability in future periods 
continued generation of cash flow from operations 
staar generated positive cash flow from operating activities in the third quarter and fourth quarters of staar has succeeded in resuming positive cash flow despite the loss of cash previously generated by domilens  which usually provided cash from operating activities on a stand alone basis and accounted for million of staar s cash from operations in staar s use of cash use in the first half of resulted primarily from a million payment to globally settle outstanding litigation in the second quarter and other outlays  including million of previously incurred transaction costs related to the disposition of domilens  million in legal fees related to litigation  approximately million in interest paid on the senior secured promissory note  including the early repayment interest of million 
based on results staar believes that  subject to the risk of future unexpected outlays  it is in position to continue generating cash from operations during staar cautions that its first quarter is typically the most challenging for cash because of accounting fees related to the annual audit of our financial statements  professional fees for our consultant on internal controls pursuant to the sarbanes oxley act of  and holiday closures of facilities during december that reduce the processing and payment of invoices by staar during the last weeks of the fourth quarter 
improve financial condition by retiring obligations and strengthening the balance sheet 
at the beginning of  staar had two significant financial obligations that were scheduled to mature in repayment of the million principal balance on the broadwood note  originally due on december   and the right of the holders of  shares of our series a redeemable  convertible preferred stock the preferred stock to redeem these shares at per share  or million in cash in aggregate 
the redemption right  by its terms  would have matured on december  after the sale of domilens in the first quarter yielded approximately million in cash and staar entered into a global settlement of its outstanding litigation  staar used its improved cash reserves to retire its major obligations during the second quarter 
after delivering a call notice to the holders  staar repurchased all of the shares of preferred stock at the redemption price on may  on june   staar prepaid the million broadwood note  plus the accrued interest as of that date  without any penalty 
since the note was scheduled to mature in december  staar also wrote off the remaining unamortized discount and issuance costs related to the note and recognized a non cash loss of  because the preferred stock was convertible into common stock on a one for one basis  the redemption of the preferred stock reduced our fully diluted capitalization by million shares at a cost of per share 
staar seeks to reserve any future capital raising efforts for initiatives to expand its business  rather than meeting existing obligations 
nevertheless  depending on staar s future cash position  it may find it necessary to seek additional financing 
see liquidity and capital resources below 
other highlights divestiture of domilens 
on march  we completed the divestiture of all of our interest in our former german distribution subsidiary  domilens gmbh through a management buyout led by funds managed by hamburg based small cap buyout specialist bpe unternehmensbeteiligungen gmbh bpe 
staar s financial advisor in the transaction was berenberg bank  a german investment bank headquartered in hamburg 
staar originally purchased domilens in a series of stock purchases from the founder of the business between and staar originally intended to use domilens as a channel for increased sales in the german market 
however  by sales of staar product accounted for only approximately of domilens sales 
the majority of domilens sales were third party products  including iols of other manufacturers  disposables and other supplies such as surgical drapes  and the assembly of custom surgical kits containing a package of mostly third party products needed for a single procedure 
while profitable  this business operates at gross profit margins that are significantly lower than staar s overall average 
as part of the divestiture staar and domilens entered into a distribution agreement under which domilens will continue to purchase staar products at the unit sales volume previously projected for through because of the nature of the domilens business and the promise of continued distribution in germany and austria at projected levels  staar determined that the sale of domilens would not impede its core business  and would permit management to focus on the higher value core business of developing  manufacturing and selling its own advanced ophthalmic products 
staar also determined that the gross purchase price received for domilens  at approximately times domilens earnings before income taxes  represented a reasonable value for its investment in domilens  and that these funds were of greater use to staar as working capital 
the stock purchase agreement provided for a purchase price of  approximately million 
after adjusting for  in cash dividends received by staar from domilens in december and january  and the exclusion of expenses related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  at closing on march  domilens akquisitions paid a cash net purchase price of  approximately million 
 of the net purchase price was paid into an escrow account  to be held against payment of any unaccrued taxes assessed for periods prior to december  funds remaining after the resolution of such potential liabilities  if any  will be distributed to staar from the escrow account  no later than december  after expenses of   related to investment banking fees  and excluding the escrowed funds and any earn out payments  staar received net cash proceeds of approximately million from the transaction approximately million and incurred legal and other costs of 
million for a net proceed of million 
the company paid a  marketing allowance in for domilens to market staar s products after the divestiture 
taxes related to the disposition of domilens were estimated to be insignificant 
based on the performance of domilens in fiscal years  and  staar may earn up to an additional  approximately  at currently prevailing exchange rates 
these additional earn out payments will be earned only if domilens significantly improves its performance over levels it has historically been able to achieve 
if a target is missed in any year  but in the following year domilens achieves the target and also makes up for the earlier shortfall  the payments for both years will be earned and paid 
domilens may not be able to achieve these improvements 
based on domilens financial performance in fiscal  the company is not entitled to the first earnout payment 
the benefits we expected to achieve from the domilens divestiture include the following approximately million in net cash proceeds  greater focus on staar s core business  significantly enhanced gross profit margins  and a contractual commitment to meet projected sales levels for staar products in germany and austria through in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  staar accounted for the divestiture of domilens as discontinued operations during fiscal as a result of this accounting treatment  in all historical periods presented  domilens results of operations and cash flows  which formerly were consolidated with those of staar and its other subsidiaries  are now segregated into a separate line item as discontinued operations  and the consolidated results of operations and cash flows of staar and its other subsidiaries have been adjusted to exclude the results of domilens 
this presentation is intended to enable the reader more easily to compare current results from continuing operations of staar s business ex domilens with the corresponding elements of the business in historical periods 
the consolidated balance sheet has not been restated and includes the assets  liabilities and stockholders equity of domilens as reported 
us icl sales 
we consider icl sales growth in the us market to be important because of the size of the us refractive surgery market and the perceived worldwide leadership of the us in adopting innovative medical technologies 
the visian icl was approved by the fda for treatment of myopia on december  visian icl sales in the us fell by during compared to prior year  and grew in when compared to levels 
most of the us growth in icl sales during the past two years has been in sales to the military  which have been offset by declines in the private sector 
market scope has reported that overall refractive surgery market in the us declined by approximately during because during the past two years staar s rates of growth or decline in us sales have remained better than the rate of decline in the overall us refractive market  staar believes that it has continued to grow market share in this challenging environment 
in order to increase us sales of the icl  private sector sales must also resume growth 
staar believes that the effects of global recession  especially the slow pace of recovery in employment  consumer spending and consumer confidence  represent the largest challenge to increased growth in us private sector icl sales 
refractive surgery is an elective procedure generally not covered by health insurance 
patients must pay for the procedure  frequently through installment financing arrangements 
staar believes that the lack of growth in private sector icl sales in the us results from the significantly lower volume of patients seeking refractive surgery in the last three years  which has reduced the number of patients to whom the icl is offered 
market scope estimates that the total number of refractive surgical procedures in the us declined by between and while icl sales have been much more resistant to the recession than laser based procedures  unless the economic recovery continues and consumer spending levels also recover  private sector icl sales will not grow significantly and may decline 
staar believes that its share of the us refractive market has grown during the past three years  which will position the icl for strong sales growth when conditions improve 
in addition to poor conditions in the general economy and in particular the refractive surgery market  other challenges to sustained growth in us visian icl sales include the following the us refractive surgery market has been dominated by corneal laser based techniques  which continue to be better known than the visian icl among potential refractive patients  other newly introduced surgical products will continue to compete with the visian icl for the attention of surgeons seeking to add new  high value surgical products  in particular multifocal and accommodating iols  negative publicity about complications of lasik could reduce interest in all refractive surgical procedures  and fda approval of the ticl  which staar sells in international markets for treating patients affected by both myopia and astigmatism  has been delayed 
to help address these challenges  during the fourth quarter staar tested a direct to consumer advertising campaign on the internet and plans to test the campaign on television and radio in selected markets in the first quarter of this campaign seeks to increase potential refractive patient visits and to encourage patients to inquire specifically about the visian icl by distinguishing it from other refractive treatments 
the initial materials for the campaign are a series of humorous one minute videos contrasting the visian icl with lasik  eyeglasses and contact lenses 
the videos highlight certain benefits of the icl over other treatments  including clarity of vision  absence of surgically induced dry eye  removability and ultraviolet protection 
we cannot yet assess the potential success of the campaign at this time 
on april   the fda ophthalmic devices panel held a public meeting to discuss issues of medical complications and customer satisfaction following refractive surgery 
while the panel also discussed phakic iols such as the visian icl  most of its discussions centered on lasik and testimony regarding customer dissatisfaction following lasik surgery 
the panel recommended enhanced patient warnings of possible complications for lasik and created a task force to study methods of better identifying those patients who are more likely to have an unsatisfactory outcome from laser vision correction 
on october   the fda announced a three phase collaborative study on the potential impact of lasik surgery on a patient s quality of life  and also issued warning letters to seventeen ambulatory surgery centers citing inadequate systems for reporting adverse events resulting from lasik 
these fda activities have been widely reported in the us in september  a former fda official received widespread publicity when he petitioned fda to revoke its approval of lasik 
while it is difficult to assess precisely the impact of these events on patient attitudes or the recommendations of practicing surgeons  it is possible that reduced demand for laser eye surgery observed in and was caused in part by concerns regarding complications and potential patient dissatisfaction 
patient concerns about lasik could increase interest in the visian icl as an alternative for patients who have a greater risk of complications from lasik 
the fact that the visian icl is removable if a patient is dissatisfied with the outcome may also be appealing to some patients with new concerns about risks of refractive surgery 
however  staar believes the negative publicity concerning lasik has decreased patient interest in all refractive surgery  including visian icl 
because nearly all candidates for refractive surgery can achieve acceptable vision through the use of spectacles or contact lenses  for most patients the decision to have refractive surgery is a lifestyle choice that depends on high confidence in achieving a satisfactory outcome 
during  staar has placed less emphasis on increasing its overall customer base and devoting more attention to identifying and supporting those practices that show potential for significant repeat business through a professional commitment to the icl technology 
us iol sales 
during staar saw indications that it may begin to reverse several years of decline in staar s us market share and sales of iols 
during total us sales of iols decreased over prior year  compared to rates of decline of and in in and the improving prospects for us iol sales largely result from growing market acceptance of the nanoflex single piece collamer aspheric lens  which in the us experienced growth in sales for the year and growth in sales during the fourth quarter of the introduction of nanoflex lens and other advanced iols reflects staar s effort to overcome the factors that contributed to the long term decline in us iol sales  including the slow pace of product improvement and enhancement during a period when we devoted most of our research and development resources to introducing the icl and to resolving the regulatory and compliance issues raised by the fda 
staar s strategy for returning to growth in its us iol business is to rationalize its product offering around its higher value products 
this has included aspheric optics across all iol platforms  improved delivery systems for collamer iols to broaden their appeal and preloaded delivery systems for silicone lenses 
successful implementation of this strategy is subject to risks  including the risk of delays in developing new products or securing regulatory approval 
staar s initiatives to enhance its iol product line have resulted in the following developments the introduction of staar s aspheric three piece collamer iol in april the introduction of staar s aspheric three piece silicone iol november the april introduction of the nanopoint injector  which delivers staar s single piece collamer iol  through a mm incision  the introduction of the nanoflex aspheric single piece collamer iol in the second quarter of  which brings advanced aspheric optics to the micro incision nanopoint platform  and the launch of the epiphany injector for the collamer three piece lens in the third quarter of which brought smoother and more controlled delivery to one of staar s most advanced lenses and paves the way for us introduction of the silicone preloaded injector 
staar intends to continue to focus on the following development projects designed to make our iol product offering more competitive introduction of the silicone preloaded injector system in the us development of preloaded injector systems for collamer iols development of a collamer toric iol to complement our pioneering silicone toric iol and better compete with the alcon acrylic toric iol 
the collamer toric iol should provide a product with advanced optic materials and rotational stability to provide superior outcomes for cataract patients with astigmatism and would likely qualify as a premium iol initiate a formal post market clinical evaluation to support a possible submission to the fda of claims that the nanoflex lens offers patients less spectacle dependence or superior mid range vision development of accommodating or presbyopic iols staar cautions that the successful development and introduction of new products is subject to risks and uncertainties  including the risk of unexpected delays and  in some cases  approval of regulatory authorities 
staar s development efforts aim to realize the full market potential for collamer iols by continuously improving lens delivery systems and differentiating staar s silicone iol offering through the preloaded injector 
approximately of iols sold by staar in the us are made of silicone  which was the original material used for foldable iols 
physician preferences in the us have shifted toward acrylic iols and silicone iols now account for approximately of the us iol market 
staar believes that its collamer lenses have outstanding optical qualities and superior biocompatibility  and should be capable of competing with any of our competitor s acrylic lens products in the advanced material sector 
in addition  increasing use of the icl  which relies on the outstanding optical properties of collamer  has also introduced the advantages of the collamer material to a growing number of surgeons 
one factor that limited growth of the collamer iol market in the past was the difficulty of perfecting delivery systems for the soft collamer material 
staar believes that its epiphany injector for the three piece collamer iol and nanopoint injector for the nanoflex lens have substantially overcome this challenge to market acceptance 
over the past several years surgeons implanting the nanoflex iol have reported that their cataract patients have better than expected near vision 
in late  staar organized the collamer accommodating study team or cast 
the cast consists of eight prominent physicians across the us who are implanting the nanoflex iol and are checking both near and intermediate vision approximately one month post operation 
feedback from the group indicates that the near vision achieved is better than that of any conventional iol where we have comparative data 
the feedback also indicates that the intermediate vision is better than presbyopia correcting iols that have been studied and near vision approaches that of presbyopia correcting iols that are already on the market 
in the first quarter of staar initiated a program called the nanoflex challenge to facilitate an interested surgeon s evaluation of the visual outcomes for patients receiving nanoflex iols compared to the outcomes from any other standard iol currently used by the surgeon 
staar believes that its marketing efforts  along with the features and benefits of the nanoflex lens and nanopoint injector system  are responsible for the product s sales growth in the us during  and that the product is capable of winning additional market share in the future 
while the market share of silicone iols has been slowly declining overall  a significant number of surgeons continue to select silicone lenses for their patients 
among us iol sales  staar believes that its recently introduced aspheric  three piece silicone iol offers outstanding optical performance and could enable staar to retain or possibly increase its market share within the silicone iol sector  especially if staar s efforts are successful in securing fda approval to make it available in a preloaded injector 
staar s efforts to increase us iol sales face a number of short and long term challenges  including successfully meeting its objectives to develop new and enhanced products and marketing them with limited resources 
the us iol market has recently become more fragmented with the entry of new competitors  including hoya surgical optics and lenstec  inc  resulting in greater competition for market share 
we cannot assure that our efforts will ultimately be successful 
medical device regulatory compliance  clinical oversight and ticl approval 
as discussed above under the caption business regulatory matters  staar s ability to develop  manufacture and distribute its products depends heavily on maintaining good standing with the fda and other regulatory agencies 
based  in part  on the results of the fda inspections of staar s california facilities in and and staar s nidau  switzerland facility in  staar believes that it is substantially in compliance with the fda s quality system regulations and medical device reporting regulations 
staar has invested significant resources in maintaining regulatory compliance and expects to continue to do so in the future 
financing strategy staar has reported losses on a consolidated basis over the last several years and has until recently experienced negative cash flow 
during recent years staar has raised additional funds to support operations through sales of equity and debt securities 
as cash flow improved in recent quarters  staar has sought to avoid further financings and to operate exclusively on self generated cash 
avoiding a short term cash shortfall was a principal consideration for staar s divestiture of domilens on march  among the expected demands on staar s capital resources underlying this decision  the most pressing was the million verdict rendered in a companion case to the case  and the potential need to post a appeal bond on or before april  the domilens divestiture yielded a total of approximately million in net cash proceeds to staar 
the march  global settlement of all pending litigation eliminated the potential need to post an appeal bond 
staar contributed million to the global settlement  paying this amount from the million including interest on deposit with the court in connection with the litigation 
as a result  staar was able to apply the entire million in net cash proceeds from the domilens sale to working capital  along with approximately million refunded to staar from the restricted deposit 
following the divestiture of domilens and the settlement of the lawsuits  on april   staar issued a call notice to the holders of its  outstanding shares of preferred stock  establishing may  as the redemption date for the preferred stock 
on may   staar redeemed all outstanding shares of preferred stock in cash for per share  or million in aggregate 
there are no preferred shares outstanding since the redemption 
other financing activity include the december  borrowing by staar of million from broadwood partners  lp  at an interest rate of per annum  primarily to fund the acquisition of staar s remaining interest in the canon staar joint venture 
the promissory note covering the loan was due on december  on june   staar prepaid the million broadwood note  plus the accrued interest as of that date  without any penalty 
following the redemption of the preferred shares and repayment of the broadwood note and release of the related lien  staar has no material indebtedness  other than the japan line of credit  or encumbrances on its assets 
these assets would therefore be available to secure a bank line of credit 
staar does not believe such a line of credit would be available on attractive terms until it establishes a record of sustained profits  and it has no plans to seek such debt financing at this time 
staar s need for working capital  renewal of existing credit facilities  and the terms on which financing may be available  will depend in part on its degree of success in achieving and maintaining positive cash flow and earnings through the strategies described above under the caption strategy 
staar cannot assure that such financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all  if the need arises

the following table presents our provision for income taxes for the fiscal years presented in thousands provision for income taxes our provision for income taxes decreased from to  primarily as a result of lower taxable income in jurisdictions where we pay tax 
our provision for income taxes increased from to  primarily as a result of an income tax benefit recorded by staar japan in that reduced the overall tax provision 
see critical accounting policies included later in this item for additional information about our provision for income taxes 
a reconciliation of the federal statutory income tax rate to our effective tax rate is set forth in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
liquidity and capital resources while staar has made significant progress in reducing operating losses and improving cash flow  it has had a history of losses and negative cash flows on a consolidated basis over the last several years 
during those years staar raised additional funds to support operations through sales of equity and debt securities 
the ability to avoid a subsequent short term cash shortfall without selling additional equity securities was a principal consideration in staar s divestiture of domilens on march  the domilens divestiture yielded a total of approximately million in net cash proceeds to staar 
on march   a global settlement of the parallax and moody cases was reached and in june  staar s million contribution to the global settlement was paid from the million release of the restricted deposit by the court 
the significant improvement in the company s cash position enabled staar to both redeem all the outstanding shares of its series a preferred stock at an aggregate redemption value of million and repay the million broadwood note  plus interest  thereby significantly enhancing its balance sheet and financial position 
the company s liquidity requirements arise from the funding of its working capital needs  primarily inventory  work in process and accounts receivable 
the company s primary sources for working capital and capital expenditures are cash flows from operating activities  proceeds from the domilens divestiture  sale of staar common stock  and borrowings under the company s credit facilities 
the company s liquidity also depends  in part  on customers paying within credit terms  and any extended delays in payments or changes in credit terms given to major customers may have an impact on the company s cash flow 
the company believes its current cash balances coupled with cash flow from operating activities will be sufficient to meet its working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
staar s need for working capital  and the terms on which financing may be available  will depend in part on its degree of success in maintaining positive cash flow through the strategies described above under the caption strategy 
overview of changes in cash and cash equivalents and other working capital accounts 
net cash used in operating activities was million in  compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million in  and net cash used in operating activities of million in fiscal in  the use of cash from operations included the following significant items payment of million related to the global settlement of the legal judgments and million used in the operating activities of discontinued operations of the disposed domilens subsidiary  payment of million of domilens transaction related costs  and approximately million interest paid for the broadwood note 
for fiscal  the cash provided by operating activities was the result of a million decrease in net loss in compared to net cash provided by investing activities was approximately million in  compared to net cash used in investing activities of million in fiscal  and net cash provided by investing activities of million in net cash provided by investing activities in was mainly due to the million net cash proceeds from the sale of our german subsidiary in march and the release of the million restricted deposit  including interest  by the court 
for  net cash used in investing activities includes the million posted as a deposit restricted deposit  including reinvested interest  with the court for the litigation appeal and million in acquisition of property  plant and equipment 
in fiscal year  net cash provided by investing activities was primaily due to million of cash acquired in the staar japan acquisition  partially offset by million of property and equipment purchases 
net cash used in provided by financing activities was approximately million  million  and million for fiscal   and  respectively 
net cash used in financing activities in includes the million principal payment on the broadwood note  the million cash redemption of the series a preferred shares  and the million repayment of principal on our capital lease obligations  partially offset by million in cash proceeds from stock option exercises 
cash provided by financing activities in was primarily from the million in proceeds from the sale of staar common stock in order to fund the parallax bond  partially offset by million repayment of principal on capital lease obligations 
in  cash provided by financing activities resulted from net borrowings of million under a line of credit in japan  partially offset by million in repayment of principan on capital lease obligations 
accounts receivable was million as of december  and million as of january  days sales outstanding dso were days in and days in the company expects to maintain dso within a range of to days during the course of fiscal inventories at the end of fiscal and were million and million  respectively 
days inventory on hand doh were days in and days in based on finished goods  including consignment inventory as of december  and january  the increase in dso and doh from to is due to the divestiture of domilens whose dso and doh was typically lower than the rest of the company 
credit facilities  contractual obligations and commitments accrued termination benefits for executive on may   staar accrued  in executive termination benefit costs in connection with the notice of non renewal given under an executive employment agreement 
this accrual represents staar s best estimate of the contractual termination benefits due to the executive 
the actual amount ultimately paid may be different 
the costs are to be paid over fifteen months beginning august  the balance of the accrual at december  is approximately credit facilities the company has credit facilities with different lenders to support operations as detailed below 
capital lease agreements the company has certain agreements with farnam street financial  inc farnam which provides lease financing to the company for purchases of property  plant and equipment 
these agreements are under various individual lease schedules which commit the company to lease a set contractual amount of assets per schedule 
each schedule has its own term  required commitment amount and lease rate factor interest rate 
in accordance with the requirements of asc  all purchases under these schedules are accounted for as capital leases 
title to all assets under the farnam leases remains with farnam 
under the agreement  the company has the option to purchase any item of the leased property within its schedule of assets at the end of that schedule s lease term  at a mutually agreed upon fair value 
if the company does not choose to purchase the asset under lease  it may rent the assets on a month to month basis or return them to farnam 
the company must provide a day notice prior to termination of its intent to purchase or return the assets 
amortization of the total capital lease obligation under any lease schedule does not begin until the company draws on the full amount of the commitment under that particular schedule which is referred to as the schedule commencement date 
however  as individual asset leases are entered into pursuant to a particular schedule but prior to the commencement date  the company pays farnam interim rent based on a predetermined lease factor applied to the actual principal amount of the purchases 
note 
line of credit the company s japanese subsidiary  staar japan  has an agreement  as amended on june   with mizuho bank which provides for borrowings of up to  yen approximately million based on the rate of exchange on december   at an interest rate equal to the tokyo short term prime interest rate approximately as of december  plus and may be renewed annually the current line expires on april  
the credit facility is not collateralized 
the company had  yen outstanding on the line of credit as of december  and january   approximately million and million based on the foreign exchange rates on december  and january  and approximates fair value due to the short term maturity and market interest rates of the line of credit 
in case of default  the interest rate will be increased to per annum 
the company believes the credit line will be renewed in fiscal in august  the company s wholly owned swiss subsidiary  staar surgical ag  entered into a credit agreement with credit suisse the bank 
the credit agreement provides for borrowings of up to  chf swiss francs  at the rate of exchange on december   to be used for working capital purposes 
accrued interest and commissions on average outstanding borrowings is payable quarterly and the interest rate will be determined by the bank based on the then prevailing market conditions at the time of borrowing 
the credit agreement is automatically renewed on an annual basis based on the same terms assuming there is no default 
the credit agreement may be terminated by either party at any time in accordance with its general terms and conditions 
the credit facility is not collateralized and contains certain conditions such as providing the bank with audited financial statements annually and notice of significant events or conditions as defined in the credit agreement 
the bank may also declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable upon a change of control or a material qualification in staar surgical ag s independent auditors report 
there were no borrowings outstanding as of december  and the full amount of the line was available for borrowing 
covenant compliance the company is in compliance with the covenants of its credit facilities and lines of credit as of the date of this report 
the following table represents the company s known contractual obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years line of credit capital lease obligations operating lease obligations pension obligations severance open purchase orders total critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowances for doubtful accounts and sales return  inventory reserves and income taxes  among others 
our estimates are based on historical experiences  market trends and financial forecasts and projections  and on various other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances and at that certain point in time 
actual results may differ  significantly at times  from these if actual conditions differ from our assumptions 
we believe the following represent our critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable 
we recognize revenue when realized or realizable and earned  which is when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sale price is fixed and determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
the company records revenue from non consignment product sales when title and risk of ownership has been transferred  which is typically at shipping point  except for our staar japan subsidiary  which is typically recognized when the product is received by the customer 
staar japan does not have significant deferred revenues as delivery to the customer is generally made within the same or the next date of shipment 
our products are marketed to ophthalmic surgeons  hospitals  ambulatory surgery centers or vision centers  and distributors 
iols may be offered to surgeons and hospitals on a consignment basis 
we maintain title and risk of loss on consigned inventory 
we recognize revenue for consignment inventory when we are informed the iol has been implanted and not upon shipment to the surgeon 
we believe our revenue recognition policies are appropriate 
we present sales tax we collect from our customers on a net basis excluded from our revenues 
we ship icls only for use by surgeons who have already been certified  or for use in scheduled training surgeries 
for all sales  we are the principal in the transaction as we  among other factors  bear general inventory risk  credit risk  have latitude in establishing the sales price and bear authorized sales returns inventory risk and therefore  sales are recognized gross with corresponding cost of sales in the statement of operations instead of a single  net amount 
cost of sales includes cost of production  freight and distribution  royalties  and inventory provisions  net of any purchase discounts 
we generally permit returns of product if the product is returned within the time allowed by our return policies  and in good condition 
we provide allowances for sales returns based on an analysis of our historical patterns of returns matched against the sales from which they originated 
while such allowances have historically been within our expectations  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same return rates that we have in the past 
measurement of such returns requires consideration of  among other factors  historical returns experience and trends  including the need to adjust for current conditions and product lines  the entry of a competitor  and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data 
we consider all available information in our quarterly assessments of the adequacy of the allowance for sales returns 
sales are reported net of estimated returns 
if the actual sales returns are higher or lower than estimated by management  additional reduction or increase in sales may occur 
we maintain provisions for uncollectible accounts based on estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to remit payments 
if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  thereby resulting in an inability to make payments  additional allowances could be required 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon customer payment history and current creditworthiness  as determined by our review of our customers current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified 
amounts determined to be uncollectible are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
measurement of such losses requires consideration of historical loss experience  including the need to adjust for current conditions  and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data  including present economic conditions such as delinquency rates and financial health of specific customers 
we consider all available information in our assessments of the adequacy of the reserves for uncollectible accounts 
stock based compensation 
we account for the issuance of stock options to employees and directors by estimating the fair value of options and warrants issued using the black scholes pricing model 
this model s calculations include the exercise price  the market price of shares on grant date  risk free interest rates  expected term of the option or warrant  expected volatility of our stock and expected dividend yield 
the amounts recorded in the financial statements for share based expense could vary significantly if we were to use different assumptions 
accounting for warrants 
we account for the issuance of company derivative equity instruments such as the warrants  in accordance with asc formerly emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock eitf 
we agreed to use our best efforts to register and maintain registration of the common shares underlying certain warrants the warrant shares that were issued by us with debt instruments  so that the warrant holder may freely sell the warrant shares if the warrant is exercised  and we agreed that in any event we would secure effective registration within a certain time period after issuance typically up to five months from issuance 
in addition  while the relevant warrant agreement does not require cash settlement if we do not maintain continuous registration of certain warrant shares  the agreement does not specifically preclude cash settlement 
as a result asc requires us to assume that in the absence of continuous effective registration we may be required to settle some of these warrants for cash when they are exercised 
accordingly  our agreement to register and maintain registration of certain warrant shares without express terms for settlement in the absence of continuous effective registration is presumed to create a liability to settle these warrants in cash  requiring liability classification 
we have issued other warrants under another agreement that expressly provides that if we fail to satisfy registration requirements we will be obligated only to issue additional common stock as the holder s sole remedy  with no possibility of settlement in cash 
in this circumstance  we account for those warrants as equity because additional shares are the only form of settlement available to the holder 
we use the black scholes option pricing model as the valuation model to estimate the fair value of all warrants 
we evaluate the balance sheet classification of the warrants during each reporting period 
expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of our stock 
the expected life of the warrant is determined by the amount of time remaining on the original six year term of the relevant warrant agreement 
the risk free rate of return for periods within the contractual life of the warrant is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at each reporting period 
any gains or losses resulting from the changes in fair value of the warrants classified as a liability from period to period are included as an increase or decrease of other income expense 
the warrants that are accounted for as equity are only valued on the issuance date and not subsequently revalued 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we evaluate the need to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets based on the amount of existing temporary differences  the period in which they are expected to be recovered and expected levels of taxable income 
a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets is established when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we expect to continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on future tax benefits until  and if  an appropriate level of profitability is sustained  or we are able to develop tax strategies that would enable us to conclude that it is more likely than not that a portion of our deferred tax assets would be realizable 
in the normal course of business  the company is regularly audited by federal  state and foreign tax authorities  and is periodically challenged regarding the amount of taxes due 
these challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
we believe that our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and intend to defend our positions 
our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be impacted if we prevailed in matters for which reserves have been established  or were required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves 
inventories 
we provide estimated inventory allowances for excess  slow moving  expiring and obsolete inventory as well as inventory whose carrying value is in excess of net realizable value 
these reserves are based on current assessments about future demands  market conditions and related management initiatives 
if market conditions and actual demands are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
we value our inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable market values 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on the expiration of products with a shelf life of less than four months  estimated forecasts of product demand and production requirements for the next twelve months 
several factors may influence the realizability of our inventories  including decisions to exit a product line  technological change and new product development 
these factors could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory may be understated or overstated 
if in the future  we determine that our inventory was overvalued  we would be required to recognize such costs in cost of sales at the time of such determination 
likewise  if we determine that our inventory was undervalued  cost of sales in previous periods could have been overstated and we would be required to recognize such additional operating income at the time of sale 
while such inventory losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same loss rates that we have in the past 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of forecasts of future product demand  including the impact of planned future product launches  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
impairment of long lived assets 
intangible and other long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events such as product discontinuance  plant closures  product dispositions or other changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
certain factors which may occur and indicate that an impairment exists include  but are not limited to the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of the company s use of the underlying assets  and significant adverse industry or market economic trends 
in reviewing for impairment  we compare the carrying value of such assets to the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition 
in the event that the carrying value of assets is determined to be unrecoverable  we would estimate the fair value of the assets and record an impairment charge for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value 
the estimate of fair value requires management to make a number of assumptions and projections  which could include  but would not be limited to  future revenues  earnings and the probability of certain outcomes and scenarios 
our policy is consistent with current accounting guidance as prescribed by asc formerly sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
goodwill 
goodwill  which has an indefinite life  is not amortized  but instead is subject to periodic testing for impairment 
intangible assets determined to have definite lives are amortized over their remaining useful lives 
goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis or between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
certain factors which may occur and indicate that an impairment exists include  but are not limited to the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the underlying assets  and significant adverse industry or market economic trends 
in the event that the carrying value of assets is determined to be unrecoverable  we would estimate the fair value of the reporting unit and record an impairment charge for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value 
the estimate of fair value requires management to make a number of assumptions and projections  which could include  but would not be limited to  future revenues  earnings and the probability of certain outcomes and scenarios  including the use of experts 
definite lived intangible assets 
we also have other intangible assets mainly consisting of patents and licenses  developed technologies and customer relationships  with a gross book value of million and accumulated amortization of million as of december  we capitalize the cost of acquiring patents and licenses 
we acquired certain customer relationships and developed technologies in the acquisition of our staar japan subsidiary which was completed on december  amortization is computed on the straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets  since the pattern in which the economic benefits realized cannot be reasonably determined  which are based on legal  contractual and other provisions  and range from to years for patents and licenses  years for customer relationships and to years for developed technology 
we review intangible assets for impairment in the assessment discussed above regarding impairment of long lived assets 
employee defined benefit plans 
we have maintained a passive pension plan the swiss plan covering employees of its swiss subsidiary 
the company concluded that the features of the swiss plan conform to the features of a defined benefit plan 
as a result  we adopted the recognition and disclosure requirements of asc transition guidance formerly statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  an amendment of sfas nos 
  and r sfas on october  
in connection with our acquisition of the remaining interest in staar japan  inc  we assumed the net pension liability under staar japan s noncontributory defined benefit pension plan substantially covering all of the employees of staar japan 
staar japan adopted the recognition and disclosure requirements of asc on december   the date of the acquisition 
asc requires recognition of the funded status  or difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligations of the pension plan on the statement of financial position with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income 
if the projected benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of plan assets  then that difference or unfunded status represents the pension liability 
we record a net periodic pension cost in the consolidated statement of operations 
the liabilities and annual income or expense of both plans are determined using methodologies that involve several actuarial assumptions  the most significant of which are the discount rate  and the expected long term rate of asset return based on the market related value of assets 
the fair values of plan assets are determined based on prevailing market prices 
the amounts recorded in the financial statements pertaining to our employee defined benefit plans could vary significantly if we were to use different assumptions 
foreign exchange management does not believe that the fluctuation in the value of the dollar in relation to the currencies of its suppliers or customers in the last three fiscal years had adversely affected our ability to purchase or sell products at agreed upon prices 
no assurance can be given  however  that adverse currency exchange rate fluctuations will not occur in the future  which could significantly affect our operating results 
we do not engage in hedging transactions to offset changes in currency or fluctuations in foreign currencies 
inflation management believes inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations during the past three years
