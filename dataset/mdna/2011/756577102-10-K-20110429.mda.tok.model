item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a global leader in providing open source software solutions to the enterprise  including our core enterprise operating system platform  red hat enterprise linux rhel  our enterprise middleware platform  jboss enterprise middleware  our virtualization and cloud solutions and other red hat enterprise technologies 
open source software is an alternative to proprietary software and represents a different model for the development and licensing of commercial software code than that typically used for proprietary software 
because open source software code is often freely shared  there are customarily no licensing fees for the distribution of open source software 
therefore  we do not recognize revenue from the licensing of the code itself 
we provide value to our customers through the aggregation  integration  testing  certification  delivery  maintenance and support of our red hat enterprise technologies  and by providing a level of scalability  stability and accountability for the enterprise technologies we package and distribute 
moreover  because communities of developers not employed by us assist with the creation of our open source offerings  opportunities for further innovation of our offerings are supplemented by these communities 
we sell our enterprise technologies through subscriptions  and we recognize revenue over the period of the subscription agreements with our customers 
we market our offerings primarily to enterprise customers including large enterprises  government organizations  small and medium size businesses and educational institutions 
we have focused on introducing and gaining acceptance for red hat enterprise technologies that comprise our open source architecture 
since introducing our initial enterprise open source operating system platform  red hat enterprise linux  it has gained widespread independent software vendor isv and independent hardware vendor ihv support 
we have continued to build our open source architecture by expanding our enterprise offerings and introducing new systems management services  middleware  integrated virtualization and clustering capability  file management systems  directory and certificate technologies and enhanced security functionality 
we intend to bring the value of open source technology to other key areas of the enterprise infrastructure as the development community efforts support and customer needs dictate 
we derive our revenue and generate cash from customers primarily from two sources i subscription revenue and ii training and services revenue 
the arrangements with our customers that produce this revenue and cash are explained in further detail under critical accounting policies and estimates below and in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these arrangements typically involve subscriptions to red hat enterprise technologies 
our revenue is affected by  among other factors  corporate  government and consumer spending levels 
in evaluating the performance of our business  we consider a number of factors  including total revenue  deferred revenue  operating income  operating margin and cash flows from operations 
revenue 
for the year ended february   total revenue increased or million to million from million for the year ended february  subscription revenue increased or million  driven primarily by additional subscriptions related to our principal rhel technologies  which continue to gain broader market acceptance in mission critical areas of computing  and our expansion of sales channels and geographic footprint 
the increase is  in part  a result of the continued migration of enterprises in industries such as telecommunications  government and financial services to our open source solutions from proprietary technologies 
training and services revenue increased or million for the year ended february  as compared to the year ended february  the increase is driven primarily by an improving economic environment in which enterprises are increasing discretionary spending in areas such as it training and consulting 

table of contents we believe the success of our business model is influenced by the extent to which we can expand the breadth and depth of our technology and service offerings  our ability to enhance the value of subscriptions for red hat enterprise technologies through frequent and continuous innovations to these technologies  the acceptance and widespread deployment of open source solutions by small  medium and large enterprises and government agencies  our ability to generate increasing revenue from channel partner and other strategic relationships  including distributors  oems  other hardware partners  isvs  cloud computing providers  vars and system integrators  our ability to generate subscription revenue for red hat enterprise technologies  and our ability to provide customers with consulting and training services that generate additional revenue 
deferred revenue 
our deferred revenue  current and long term  balance at february  was million 
because of our subscription model and revenue recognition policies  deferred revenue improves predictability of future revenue 
deferred revenue at february  increased million or as compared to the balance at february  of million 
the change in deferred revenue reported on our consolidated balance sheets of million differs from the million change in deferred revenue we reported on our consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended february  due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates used to translate deferred revenue balances from our foreign subsidiaries functional currency into us dollars 
subscriptions 
our enterprise technologies are sold under subscription agreements 
these agreements typically have a one or three year subscription period 
the subscription entitles the end user to maintenance  which generally consists of a specified level of support  as well as security updates  bug fixes  functionality enhancements and upgrades to the technology  when and if available  during the term of the subscription 
our customers have the ability to purchase higher levels of subscriptions that increase the level of support the customer is entitled to receive 
subscription revenue increased sequentially for each quarter of fiscal  and and is being driven primarily by the increased market acceptance and use of open source software by the enterprise and our expansion of sales channels and geographic footprint during these periods 
revenue by geography 
we operate our business in three geographic regions the americas us  latin america and canada  emea europe  middle east and africa  and asia pacific principally japan  singapore  india  australia  south korea and china 
during the year ended february   approximately million or of our revenue was generated outside the united states compared to approximately million or for the year ended february  our international operations are expected to continue to grow as our international sales force and channels become more mature and as we enter new locations or expand our presence in existing locations 
as of february   we had offices in more than locations throughout the world 
gross profit margin 
primarily as a result of investments made during our current fiscal year in process and technology infrastructure enhancements to support the delivery of our training and professional services across a growing geographic footprint  gross profit margin decreased to for the year ended february  from for the year ended february  for fiscal  we intend to continue investing in our global training and professional services business 
income from operations 
operating income was and of total revenue for the years ended february  and february   respectively 
operating income as a percentage of revenue for the year ended february   includes the impact of an million expense representing our portion of the settlement of a class action lawsuit brought on behalf of certain shareholders in connection with the restatement 
table of contents of our financial results announced in july excluding the impact of the litigation settlement expense during the year ended february   the remaining increase in operating income as a percentage of revenue is a result of the decrease in operating expenses relative to revenue as we continued to focus on managing discretionary spending and leveraging existing resources within corporate functions 
overall operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to for the year ended february  from for the year ended february  business combinations 
on november   we acquired makara  a developer of deployment and management solutions for applications in the cloud 
for further discussion  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
on september   we announced our acquisition of qumranet  including its kernel virtual machine kvm and solidice virtualization technologies  for approximately million in cash 
the acquisition provides server and desktop virtualization technologies and expertise  related virtualization management capabilities  communities of development and use  and additional influence in  and acceptance of  virtualization technology in the linux kernel  upon which our red hat linux platform is based 
for further discussion  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
cash  cash equivalents  investments in debt and equity securities and cash flow from operations 
cash  cash equivalents and short term and long term available for sale investments in securities balances at february  totaled billion 
cash generated from operating activities for the year ended february  totaled million  primarily as a result of the increase in subscription revenue and billings during the same period 
additionally  employees exercise of stock options generated million of cash proceeds for the year ended february  our significant cash balance gives us a measure of flexibility to take advantage of opportunities such as acquisitions  increasing investment in international areas and repurchasing our own common stock 
foreign currency exchange rates impact on results of operations 
approximately of our revenue for the year ended february  was produced by sales outside the united states 
we are exposed to significant risks of foreign currency fluctuation primarily from receivables denominated in foreign currency and are subject to transaction gains and losses  which are recorded as a component in determining net income 
the income statements of our non us operations are translated into non us dollars at the average exchange rates for each applicable month in a period 
to the extent the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies  the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions results in increased revenue and operating expenses from operations for our non us operations 
similarly  our revenue and operating expenses will decrease for our non us operations if the non us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies 
using the average foreign currency exchange rates from our prior fiscal year ended february   our revenue and operating expenses from non us operations for the year ended february  would have been higher than we reported using the average exchange rates for the current fiscal year ending february  by approximately million and million  respectively  which would have resulted in income from operations being lower by million 
in our fiscal year ended february   we have focused and expect in our fiscal year ending february  to continue to focus on  among other things  i gaining widespread acceptance and deployment of red hat enterprise technologies by enterprise users globally  ii generating increasing revenue from our existing customer base by renewing existing subscriptions  providing additional value to our customers and by growing the number of enterprise technologies that comprise our open source architecture  iii generating increased revenue by providing additional systems management  developer support and other targeted services and iv generating increasing revenue from additional market penetration through a broader and deeper set of channel partner relationships  including oems  vars and systems integrators and our own international expansion  among other means 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our critical accounting policies and estimates include the following revenue recognition  impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets  share based compensation  and deferred taxes and uncertain tax positions 
revenue recognition we establish persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement for each type of revenue transaction based on either a signed contract with the end customer  a click through contract on our website whereby the customer agrees to our standard subscription terms  signed or click through distribution contracts with oems and other resellers  or  in the case of individual training seats  through receipt of payment which indicates acceptance of our training agreement terms 
subscription revenue subscription revenue is comprised of direct and indirect sales of red hat enterprise technologies 
accounts receivable and deferred revenue are recorded at the time a customer enters into a binding subscription agreement for the purchase of a subscription  subscription services are made available to the customer and the customer is billed 
the deferred revenue amount is recognized as revenue ratably over the life of the subscription 
red hat enterprise technologies are generally offered with either one or three year base subscription periods  the majority of our subscriptions have one year terms 
under these subscription agreements  renewal rates are generally specified for one or three year renewal terms 
the base subscription generally entitles the end user to the technology itself and post contract customer support pcs  generally consisting of a specified level of customer support and security errata  bug fixes  functionality enhancements to the technology and upgrades to new versions of the technologies  each on a when and if available basis  during the term of the subscription 
we sell our technology offerings through two principal channels direct  which includes sales by our sales force as well as web store sales  and indirect  which includes distributors  resellers  systems integrators and oems 
we recognize revenue from the sale of red hat enterprise technologies ratably over the period of the subscription beginning on the commencement date of the subscription agreement 
subscription arrangements with large enterprise customers often have contracts with multiple elements eg  software technology  maintenance  training  consulting and other services 
we allocate revenue to each element of the arrangement based on vendor specific objective evidence of each element s fair value when we can demonstrate sufficient evidence of the fair value of at least those elements that are undelivered 
the fair value of each element in multiple element arrangements is created by either i providing the customer with the ability during the term of the arrangement to renew that element at the same rate paid for the element included in the initial term of the agreement or ii selling the element on a stand alone basis 
training and services revenue training and services revenue is comprised of revenue for consulting  engineering and customer training and education services 
consulting services consist of time based arrangements  and revenue is recognized as these services are performed 
engineering services represent revenue earned under fixed fee arrangements with our oem partners and other customers to provide for significant modification and customization of our red hat enterprise technologies 
we recognize revenue for these fixed fee engineering services using the percentage of completion basis of accounting  provided we have the ability to make reliable estimates of progress towards completion  the fee for such services is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is 
table of contents probable 
under the percentage of completion method  earnings under the contract are recognized based on the progress toward completion as estimated using the ratio of labor hours incurred to total expected project hours 
changes in estimates are recognized in the period in which they are known 
revenue for customer training and education services is recognized on the dates the services are complete 
goodwill and other long lived assets we test goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate an impairment may exist 
we test goodwill at least annually using a two step process that begins with identifying any potential impairment 
potential impairment is identified if the fair value of the reporting unit to which goodwill applies is less than the recognized or book value of the related reporting entity  including such goodwill 
where the book value of a reporting entity  including related goodwill  is greater than the reporting entity s fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
for the three years ended february   we did not identify any potential impairment related to our goodwill 
we evaluate the recoverability of our property and equipment and other long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred 
an impairment loss is recognized when the net book value of such assets exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets or the business to which the assets relate 
impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the assets 
for the three years ended february   no significant impairment losses related to our long lived assets were identified 
for further discussion  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
share based compensation we account for share based compensation under the provisions of fasb asc section compensation stock compensation formerly referenced as statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment asc 
in applying asc  we are required to make estimates and assumptions with regards to the number of share based awards that we expect will ultimately vest and the amount of tax benefits we expect will ultimately be realized  among other things 
the amount of share based awards that actually vest and the amount of tax benefits from share based awards actually realized may differ significantly from our estimates 
for further discussion  see note and note to the consolidated financial statements 
deferred taxes and uncertain tax positions we account for income taxes using the liability method in which deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognized for the temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for tax carryforwards at enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we continue to assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets  which primarily consist of share based compensation expense deductions  tax credit carryforwards and deferred revenue 
in assessing the realizability of these deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
as of february   deferred tax assets totaled million  of which million was offset by a valuation allowance 
we continue to maintain a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets with respect to certain foreign net operating loss nol carryforwards 
for further discussion regarding deferred income taxes see note and note to the consolidated financial statements 
with respect to foreign earnings  it is our policy to invest the earnings of foreign subsidiaries indefinitely outside the us from time to time  however  we may remit a portion of these earnings to the extent we incur no additional us tax and it is otherwise feasible 

table of contents because tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations  significant judgment is required 
as a result  we make certain estimates and assumptions  in i calculating our income tax expense  deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities  ii determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets and iii evaluating the amount of unrecognized tax benefits  as well as the interest and penalties related to such uncertain tax positions 
our estimates and assumptions may differ significantly from tax benefits ultimately realized 
for further discussion regarding uncertain tax positions see note to the consolidated financial statements

table of contents capital requirements we have experienced a substantial increase in our operating expenses since our inception in connection with the growth of our operations  the development of our enterprise technologies  the expansion of our services operations and our acquisition activity 
our capital requirements during the year ending february  will depend on numerous factors  including the amount of resources we devote to funding the continued development of our enterprise technology offerings  accelerating the development of our systems management services  improving and extending our services and the technologies used to deliver these services to our customers and support our business  pursuing strategic acquisitions and alliances  and investing in businesses  products and technologies 
we have utilized  and will continue from time to time to utilize  cash and investments to fund  among other potential uses  purchases of our common stock  purchases of fixed assets and mergers and acquisitions 
given our historically strong operating cash flow and the billion of cash and investments held at february   we do not presently anticipate the need to raise cash to fund our operations  either through the sale of additional equity or through the issuance of debt  in the foreseeable future 
however  we may take advantage of favorable capital market situations that may arise from time to time to raise additional capital 
we believe that cash flow from operations will continue to improve  however  there can be no assurances that we will improve our cash flow from operations from the current rate or that such cash flows will be adequate to fund other investments or acquisitions that we may choose to make 
we may choose to accelerate the expansion of our business from our current plans  which may require us to raise additional funds through the sale of equity or debt securities or through other financing means 
there can be no assurances that any such financing would occur in amounts or on terms favorable to us  if at all 
off balance sheet arrangements as of february  and february   we have no off balance sheet financing arrangements and do not utilize any structured debt  special purpose or similar unconsolidated entities for liquidity or financing purposes

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and changes in the market value of our investments 
interest rate risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and liquidity while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term and long term investments in a variety of fixed income securities  including both government and corporate obligations and money market funds 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in prevailing interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates  or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates or perceived credit risk related to the securities issuers 
a hypothetical one percentage point change in interest rates  assuming a parallel shift of all interest rates  would result in an million change in annual interest income derived from investments in our portfolio as of february  for further discussion related to our investments as of february  and february   see note and note to the consolidated financial statements 
investment risk the fair market value of our investment portfolio is subject to interest rate risk 
based on a sensitivity analysis performed on this investment portfolio  a hypothetical one percentage point increase in prevailing interest rates would result in an approximate million decrease in the fair value of our available for sale investment securities as of february  for further discussion related to our investments as of february  and february   see note and note to the consolidated financial statements 
credit risk the fair market values of our investment portfolio and cash balances are exposed to counterparty credit risk 
accordingly  while we periodically review our portfolio in an effort to mitigate counterparty risk  the principal values of our cash balances  money market accounts and investments in available for sale securities could suffer a loss of value 
foreign currency risk approximately of our revenue for the year ended february  was produced by sales outside the united states 
we are exposed to significant risks of foreign currency fluctuation primarily from receivables denominated in foreign currency and are subject to transaction gains and losses  which are recorded as a component in determining net income 
the income statements of our non us operations are translated into us dollars at the average exchange rates for each applicable month in a period 
to the extent the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies  the translation of these foreign currency statements results in increased revenue and operating expenses for our non us operations 
similarly  our revenue and operating expenses for our non us operations decreases if the non us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies 
using the average foreign currency exchange rates from the year ended february   our revenue from non us operations for the year ended february  would have been higher than we reported using the average exchange rates for the year ending february  by approximately million 
under the same assumptions  operating expenses would have been higher than we reported by approximately million  which would have resulted in income from operations being lower by approximately million 
for further discussion  see note and note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents derivative instruments we transact business in various foreign countries and are  therefore  subject to risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
we sometimes enter into forward contracts to economically hedge transactional exposure associated with commitments arising from trade accounts receivable  trade accounts payable and fixed purchase obligations denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the respective operating entity 
all derivative instruments are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at their respective fair market values in accordance with fasb asc section formerly referenced as statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the company has elected not to prepare and maintain the documentation required to qualify its forward contracts for hedge accounting treatment and  therefore  changes in fair value are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations 
the aggregate notional amount of outstanding forward contracts at february  was million 
the fair value of these outstanding contracts at february  was a gross million asset and a gross million liability  and is recorded in other current assets and accrued expenses  respectively on the consolidated balance sheets 
the forward contracts generally expire within three months of the period ended february  the forward contracts will settle in japanese yen  swiss francs  swedish krona  czech koruna  canadian dollars  singapore dollars and australian dollars 
the aggregate notional amount of outstanding forward contracts at february  was million 
the fair value of these outstanding contracts at february  was  gross  a less than million asset and a less than million liability  and is recorded in other current assets and accrued expenses  respectively on the consolidated balance sheets
