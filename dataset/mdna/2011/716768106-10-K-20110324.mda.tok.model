item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could materially differ from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in this section  as well as in the sections entitled competition  distribution and government regulation included in item part i and risk factors included in item part a of this annual report on form k 
overview based on our net sales of billion  we are north america s leading specialty provider of products  services and solutions for the lifetime needs of pets 
as of january   we operated  stores  and we anticipate opening to net new stores in our stores carry a broad assortment of high quality pet supplies at everyday low prices 
we offer approximately  distinct items  including nationally recognized brand names  as well as an extensive selection of proprietary brands across a range of product categories 
we complement our extensive product assortment with a wide selection of pet services  including grooming  training  boarding and day camp 
all our stores offer complete pet training services  and virtually all our stores feature pet styling salons that provide high quality grooming services 
our petshotels provide boarding for dogs and cats  which includes hour supervision  an on call veterinarian  temperature controlled rooms and suites  daily specialty treats and play time  as well as day camp for dogs

as of january   full service veterinary hospitals were in of our stores 
banfield operated of the veterinary hospitals 
the remaining hospitals are operated by other third parties in canada 
the principal challenges we face as a business are the highly competitive market in which we operate and the recent changes in the macroeconomy 
however  we believe we have a competitive advantage in our solutions for the total lifetime care sm of pets  including pet services and proprietary brands  which we believe cannot be easily duplicated 
additionally  we believe that our cash flow from operations and cash on hand will be adequate to meet our operating  investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future and we continue to have access to our revolving credit facility 
we expect to continuously assess the economic environment and market conditions to guide our decisions regarding our uses of cash  including capital expenditures  investments  dividends and share repurchases

critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates for inventory valuation reserves  asset impairments  reserve for closed stores  insurance liabilities and reserves  and reserves against deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
under different assumptions or conditions  actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates we use in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
inventory valuation reserves we have established reserves for estimated inventory shrinkage between physical inventories 
distribution centers perform cycle counts encompassing all inventory items at least once every quarter 
stores generally perform physical inventories at least once a year 
between the physical inventories  stores perform counts on certain inventory items 
for each reporting period presented  we estimate the inventory shrinkage based on a two year historical trend analysis 
changes in shrink results or market conditions could cause actual results to vary from estimates used to establish the inventory reserves 
we also have reserves for estimated obsolescence and to reduce merchandise inventory to the lower of cost or market 
we evaluate inventories for excess  obsolescence or other factors that may render inventories unmarketable at their historical cost 
factors included in determining obsolescence reserves include current and anticipated demand  customer preferences  age of merchandise  seasonal trends and decisions to discontinue certain products 
if assumptions about future demand change  or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  we may require additional reserves 
we have not made any significant changes in the accounting methodology we use to establish our inventory valuation reserves during the past three fiscal years 
we do not presently believe there is a reasonable likelihood of a material change in the accounting methodology and assumed factors used to create the estimates we use to calculate our inventory valuation reserves 
as of january   and january   we had inventory valuation reserves of million and million  respectively 
additionally  we believe that a change in our inventory valuation reserves would not be material to our consolidated financial statements 
asset impairments we review long lived assets for impairment on a quarterly basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the book value of such assets may not be recoverable 

table of contents we have not made any significant changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years 
we do not presently believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate long lived asset impairment losses 
there were no material asset impairments identified during  or reserve for closed stores we continuously evaluate the performance of our stores and periodically close those that are under performing 
closed stores are generally replaced by a new store in a nearby location 
we establish reserves for future occupancy payments on closed stores in the period the store is closed 
these costs are classified in operating  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 
as of january   and january   our reserve for closed stores was million and million  respectively 
we do not presently believe there is a reasonable likelihood of a material change in the future estimates or assumptions that we use to determine our reserve for closed stores  including cash flow projections and sublease assumptions 
in any event  a change in our reserve for closed stores would not be material to our consolidated financial statements 
insurance liabilities and reserves we maintain workers compensation  general liability  product liability and property insurance  on all our operations  properties and leasehold interests 
we utilize high deductible plans for each of these areas including a self insured health plan for our eligible associates 
workers compensation deductibles generally carry a million per occurrence risk of claim liability 
our general liability plan specifies a million per occurrence risk of claim liability 
we establish reserves for claims under workers compensation and general liability plans based on periodic actuarial estimates of the amount of loss for all pending claims  including estimates for which claims have been incurred but not reported 
our loss estimates rely on actuarial observations of ultimate loss experience for similar historical events and changes in such assumptions could result in an adjustment  favorable or adverse  to our reserves 
as of january   and january   we had approximately million and million  respectively  in reserves related to workers compensation  general liability and self insured health plans 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to establish our insurance reserves during the past three years 
we do not presently believe there is a reasonable likelihood of a material change in the estimates or assumptions that we use to calculate our insurance reserves  including factors such as historical claims experience  demographic factors  severity factors and other valuations 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
a change in our insurance reserves would have affected net income by approximately million in reserves against deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions we establish deferred income tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the income tax bases of our assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such assets or liabilities are realized or settled 
we record a valuation allowance on the deferred income tax assets to reduce the total to an amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
valuation allowances at january   and january   were principally to offset certain deferred income tax assets for net operating and capital loss carryforwards 
we operate in multiple tax jurisdictions and could be subject to audit in any of these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues that may require an extended period of time to resolve and may cover multiple years 
to the extent we prevail in matters for which reserves have been established  or are required to pay amounts in excess of our reserves  our effective income tax rate in a given fiscal period could be materially affected 
an unfavorable tax settlement would require use of our cash and could result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 
a favorable tax settlement could result in a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 
although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable  actual results could differ  and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 

table of contents results of operations the following table presents the percent to net sales of certain items included in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income year ended january  january  february  statement of operations data net sales cost of sales gross profit operating  general and administrative expenses operating income interest expense  net income before income tax expense and equity in income from banfield income tax expense equity in income from banfield net income compared to net sales net sales increased billion  or  to billion in  compared to net sales of billion in the increase in net sales was partially impacted by million in favorable foreign currency fluctuations during approximately of the sales increase is due to the addition of net new stores and new petshotels since january   and of the increase is due to a increase in comparable store sales for  and the remaining of the sales increase is due to other revenue from reimbursements charged to banfield 
the increase in comparable store sales was due to the impact of merchandising strategies  pricing strategies and new product offerings 
comparable store transactions  which we use as a proxy for traffic  represented basis points of the comparable store sales growth in  compared to a basis point decline in an increase in the average sales per transaction represented basis points of the comparable store sales growth in  compared to basis points in services sales  which include grooming  training  boarding and day camp  increased  or million  to million for  compared to million for services sales represented and of net sales for and  respectively 
the increase in services sales is primarily due to continued strong demand for our grooming services  and the addition of net new stores and new petshotels since gross profit gross profit increased basis points to of net sales for  from for overall merchandise margin increased basis points due to the sales of a higher margin mix of products within the product categories 
our hardgoods sales outpaced the sales growth of our consumables category during  primarily due to the addition of the flea and tick product line 
the flea and tick margin  net of shrink  was slightly higher than our average consumables margin  but significantly less than our average merchandise margin 
hardgoods merchandise includes pet supplies such as collars  leashes  health care supplies  grooming and beauty aids  toys and apparel  as well as pet beds and carriers 
consumables merchandise sales  which include pet food  treats  and litter  generate lower gross margins on average compared to hardgoods merchandise 

table of contents services negatively contributed to gross margin by basis points 
services sales typically generate lower gross margins than merchandise sales as service related labor is included in cost of sales  however  services generate higher operating margins than merchandise sales 
store occupancy costs included in gross margin provided basis points of improvement due to leverage associated with the increase in net sales  favorable lease negotiations and lower utility costs 
warehouse and distribution costs included in gross margin provided a benefit of basis points due to leverage associated with the increase in net sales 
recognizing reimbursements from banfield as other revenue negatively impacted gross margin by basis points 
in accordance with our master operating agreement with banfield  we charge banfield license fees for the space used by the veterinary hospitals and for their portion of utilities costs 
we also charge banfield for its portion of specific operating expenses 
prior to february   license fees were treated as a reduction of occupancy costs  which are included as a component of cost of merchandise sales  and reimbursements for specific operating expenses were treated as a reduction of operating  general and administrative expense in the condensed consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income 
beginning february   license fees and the reimbursements for specific operating expenses are included in other revenue  and the related costs are included in cost of other revenue in the condensed consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive income 
operating  general and administrative expenses operating  general and administrative expenses decreased to of net sales from of net sales for and  respectively 
operating  general and administrative expenses increased on a dollar basis by million 
the primary reasons for the year over year increase include increases in costs for incentive compensation associated with better than expected financial results  increased advertising costs  higher bank fees associated with increases in debit card rates and higher claims expense for health insurance 
interest expense  net interest expense  which is primarily related to capital lease obligations  decreased to million for  compared to million for included in interest expense  net was interest income of million and million for and  respectively 
income tax expense for  income tax expense was million  compared with income tax expense of million 
the effective tax rate was for both years 
the effective tax rate is calculated by dividing our income tax expense  which includes the income tax expense related to our equity in income from banfield  by income before income tax expense and equity in income from banfield 
equity in income from banfield our equity in income from our investment in banfield was million and million for and  respectively  based on our ownership percentage in banfield 
compared to net sales net sales increased billion  or  to billion in  compared to net sales of billion in the increase in net sales was partially impacted by million in unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations during approximately of the sales increase is due to the addition of net new stores and new petshotels since february   and of the increase is due to a increase in comparable store sales for the increase in comparable store sales was due to the impact of key merchandising and pricing strategies  primarily in our hardgoods categories  partially offset by economic conditions and the slowdown in consumer spending 
a decrease in the number of transactions represented a basis point decline of the comparable store sales growth in  compared to basis point decline in an increase in the average sales per transaction represented basis points of the comparable store sales growth in  compared to basis points in 
table of contents services sales  which are included in the net sales amount discussed above and include grooming  training  boarding and day camp  increased  or million  to million for  compared to million for services sales represented and of net sales for and  respectively 
the increase in services sales is primarily due to the demand for our grooming services  and the addition of net new stores and new petshotels since gross profit gross profit decreased to of net sales for  from for  representing a decrease of basis points 
overall merchandise margin decreased basis points 
merchandise product margin decreased basis points  with mix representing and rate representing of the decline 
the mix shift is due to an increase in consumables merchandise sales relative to net sales 
the rate impact is due to select price reductions  an increase in promotions for hardgoods merchandise  and broad category promotions to drive additional customer traffic 
difficult macroeconomic conditions  including reduced discretionary consumer spending  challenged our merchandise product margins as we have experienced a mix shift from higher margin discretionary hardgoods into consumables 
consumables merchandise sales  which include pet food  treats  and litter  generate lower gross margins on average compared to hardgoods merchandise 
hardgoods merchandise includes pet supplies such as collars  leashes  health care supplies  grooming and beauty aids  toys  and apparel  as well as pet beds and carriers 
merchandise margins related to the flow through of previously capitalized inbound freight  as well as certain procurement and distribution costs  decreased basis points 
services margin increased basis points primarily due to the demand for our grooming services  and the addition of new petshotels since services sales typically generate lower gross margins than merchandise sales as service related labor is included in cost of sales  however  services generate higher operating margins than merchandise sales 
as discussed above  the shift in merchandise sales to consumables merchandise has contributed to the overall decrease in margin 
store occupancy costs included in margin increased basis points primarily due to the addition of new stores and new store growth outpacing the rate of sales growth 
supply chain costs decreased basis points due to lower fuel costs  transportation efficiencies and improved productivity in our distribution centers 
operating  general and administrative expenses operating  general and administrative expenses were and of net sales for and  respectively  representing an improvement of basis points 
the primary reasons for the decrease in operating  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales during were increased efficiencies in our advertising spending due to lower advertising rates and lower store preopening expenses due to slower store growth 
store labor expense  travel and supplies costs were also lower due to vendor renegotiations and various cost control initiatives 
interest expense  net interest expense  which is primarily related to capital lease obligations  increased to million for  compared to million for included in interest expense  net was interest income of million for both and income tax expense in  the million income tax expense represents an effective tax rate of  compared with income tax expense of million  which represented an effective tax rate of 
the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to tax exempt gains from invested assets to fund our deferred compensation plan 
the effective tax rate is calculated by dividing our income tax expense  which includes the income tax expense 
table of contents related to our equity in income from banfield  by income before income tax expense and equity in income from banfield 
equity in income from banfield our equity in income from our investment in banfield was million and million for and  respectively  based on our ownership percentage in banfield s net income 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow we believe that our operating cash flow and cash on hand will be adequate to meet our operating  investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future 
in addition  we also have access to our million revolving credit facility  although there can be no assurance of our ability to access these markets on commercially acceptable terms in the future 
we expect to continuously assess the economic environment and market conditions to guide our decisions regarding our uses of cash  including capital expenditures  investments  dividends and the purchase of our common stock 
we finance our operations  new store and petshotel growth  store remodels and other expenditures to support our growth initiatives primarily through cash generated by operating activities 
receipts from our sales come from cash  checks and third party debit and credit cards  and therefore provide a significant source of liquidity 
cash is used in operating activities primarily to fund procurement of merchandise inventories and other assets  net of accounts payable and other accrued liabilities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for  million for and million for the primary differences between and were increased purchases of merchandise inventories and income tax payments 
income tax payments were greater in as a result of increased earnings and due to the benefit provided in by the prepaid tax position at the end of the primary differences between and were lower levels of merchandise inventories and prepaid assets and an increase in other current liabilities  offset by an increase in deferred income taxes 
included in were million of tax benefits from the economic stimulus act of  which provided for an accelerated depreciation deduction for certain qualifying property 
cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of expenditures associated with opening new stores  reformatting existing stores  expenditures associated with equipment and computer software in support of our system initiatives  petshotel construction costs  and other expenditures to support our growth plans and initiatives 
net cash used in investing activities was million for  million for and million for the primary differences between and resulted from an increase in restricted cash during  an increase in cash paid for property and equipment in and our investment in short term available for sale securities during the primary differences between and were a decrease in cash paid for property and equipment as a result of the slowdown in store openings  and an increase in restricted cash 
net cash used in financing activities was million for  million for and million for the net cash used in consisted primarily of the purchase of treasury stock  payments on capital lease obligations  and payments of cash dividends offset by net proceeds from common stock issued under equity incentive plans 
the primary difference between and was an increase in cash paid for treasury stock 
the primary differences between and were increased purchases of treasury stock and no short term debt borrowings 
free cash flow free cash flow is considered a non gaap financial measure under the sec s rules 
management believes  however  that free cash flow is an important financial measure for use in evaluating our financial performance  or our ability to generate future cash from our business operations 
free cash flow should be considered in addition to  rather than as a substitute for  net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity 

table of contents although other companies report free cash flow  numerous methods exist for calculating free cash flow 
as a result  the method used by our management to calculate free cash flow may differ from the methods other companies use to calculate free cash flow 
we urge you to understand the methods used by another company to calculate free cash flow before comparing our free cash flow to that of another company 
we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus cash paid for property and equipment  and payments of capital lease obligations 
we generated free cash flow of million  million  and million for   and  respectively 
for the year ended january   our free cash flow decreased primarily due to increases in merchandise inventory balances  income tax payments  capital spending and capital lease payments during for the year ended january   our free cash flow increased primarily due to a decrease in capital spending as a result of the slowdown in store openings

in accordance with our master operating agreement with banfield  we charge banfield license fees for the space used by the veterinary hospitals and for their portion of utilities costs 
we also charge banfield for its portion of specific operating expenses 
prior to february   license fees were treated as a reduction of occupancy costs  which are included as a component of cost of merchandise sales  and reimbursements for specific operating expenses were treated as a reduction of operating  general and administrative expense in the condensed consolidated statement of income and comprehensive income 
beginning february   license fees and the reimbursements for specific operating expenses are included in other revenue  and the related costs are included in cost of other revenue in the condensed consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive income

receivables from banfield totaled million and million at january   and january   respectively  and were included in the receivables in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the master operating agreement also includes a provision for the sharing of profits on the sales of therapeutic pet foods sold in all stores with a hospital operated by banfield 
the net sales and gross profits on the sale of therapeutic pet foods are not material to our consolidated financial statements 
credit facility we have a million revolving credit facility  or revolving credit facility  that expires on august  borrowings under the revolving credit facility are subject to a borrowing base and bear interest  at our option  at a bank s prime rate plus to or libor plus to 
we are subject to fees payable to lenders each quarter at an annual rate of of the unused amount of the revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility also gives us the ability to issue letters of credit  which reduce the amount available under the revolving credit facility 
letter of credit issuances under the revolving credit facility are subject to interest payable to the lenders and bear interest of to for standby letters of credit or to for commercial letters of credit 
as of january   we had no borrowings and million in stand by letter of 
table of contents credit issuances under our revolving credit facility 
as of january   we had no borrowings and million in stand by letter of credit issuances under our revolving credit facility 
we also have a million stand alone letter of credit facility  or stand alone letter of credit facility  that expires august  we are subject to fees payable to the lender each quarter at an annual rate of of the average daily face amount of the letters of credit outstanding during the preceding calendar quarter 
in addition  we are required to maintain a cash deposit with the lender equal to the amount of outstanding letters of credit or we may use other approved investments as collateral 
if we use other approved investments as collateral  we must have an amount on deposit which  when multiplied by the advance rate of  is equal to the amount of the outstanding letters of credit under the stand alone letter of credit facility 
as of january   we had million in outstanding letters of credit under the stand alone letter of credit facility and million in restricted cash on deposit with the lender

the revolving credit facility and stand alone letter of credit facility permit the payment of dividends  if we are not in default and the payment of dividends would not result in default of the revolving credit facility or stand alone letter of credit facility 
as of january   we were in compliance with the terms and covenants of our revolving credit facility and stand alone letter of credit facility 
the revolving credit facility and stand alone letter of credit facility are secured by substantially all our personal property assets  our wholly owned subsidiaries and certain real property 
seasonality and inflation our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
we typically realize a higher portion of our net sales and operating profits during the fourth quarter due to increased holiday traffic 
as a result of this seasonality  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful  and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
controllable expenses could fluctuate from quarter to quarter in a year 
since our stores typically draw customers from a large trade area  sales also may be impacted by adverse weather or travel conditions  which are more prevalent during certain seasons of the year 
as a result of our expansion plans  the timing of new store and petshotel openings and related preopening costs  the amount of revenue contributed by new and existing stores and petshotels and the timing and estimated obligations of store closures  our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate 
finally  because new stores tend to experience higher payroll  advertising and other store level expenses as a percentage of sales than mature stores  new store openings will also contribute to lower store operating margins until these stores become established 
we expense preopening costs associated with each new location as the costs are incurred 
while we have experienced inflationary pressure in recent years  we have been able to largely mitigate the effect by increasing retail prices accordingly 
although neither inflation nor deflation has had a material impact on net operating results  we can make no assurance that our business will not be affected by inflation or deflation in the future 
impact of federal health care reform legislation in march  the president of the united states signed into law the patient protection and affordable care act  as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act of  or the acts 
the provisions of the acts are not expected to have a significant impact to our consolidated financial statements in the short term 
the longer term potential impacts of the acts to our business and the consolidated financial statements are currently uncertain 
we will continue to assess the impact of the acts on our health care plans 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to certain market risks arising from transactions in the normal course of our business 
such risk is principally associated with foreign exchange fluctuations 

table of contents foreign currency risk our canadian subsidiary operates stores and uses the canadian dollar as the functional currency and the united states dollar as the reporting currency 
we have certain exposures to foreign currency risk 
net sales in canada  denominated in united states dollars  were million  or  of our consolidated net sales for transaction gains and losses denominated in the united states dollar are recorded in cost of sales or operating  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income depending on the nature of the underlying transaction

from time to time we enter into foreign currency forward contracts  or foreign exchange contracts  as a way to manage the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to certain balance sheet accounts  primarily to mitigate risk related to non functional currency exposures 
these foreign exchange contracts are not designated as hedges  and therefore  are recorded at fair value through earnings using quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets 
the loss included in net income was million for we did not enter into foreign exchange contracts during or
