item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the company is a financial holding company that offers a broad array of financial service products to its target market of professionals  small and medium sized businesses  and high net worth individuals 
our operating segments include commercial banking  investment banking  wealth management  and insurance 
earnings are derived primarily from our net interest income  which is interest income less interest expense  and our noninterest income earned from fee based business lines and banking service fees  offset by noninterest expense 
as the majority of our assets are interest earning and our liabilities are interest bearing  changes in interest rates impact our net interest margin  the largest component of our operating revenue which is defined as net interest income plus noninterest income 
we manage our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on our operating results 
we also have focused on reducing our dependency on our net interest margin by increasing our noninterest income 
during the economic and industry turmoil since  we have continued to focus on developing an organization with personnel  management systems and products that will allow us to compete effectively and position us for growth 
many of our competitors have drastically cut costs by closing locations and reducing employee bases during this time 
although we have also focused on reducing costs that do not impact customer service  we have also continued to invest in systems and business production personnel to strengthen our future growth prospects 
the economic downturn has also negatively impacted our customer base and our levels of nonperforming assets have increased as a result 
the combination of the increased levels of nonperforming assets and continued investment in the business has caused relatively high levels of noninterest expense that has adversely affected our earnings over the past several years 
salaries and employee benefits  loan workout costs and losses on other real estate owned oreo have comprised most of this overhead category 
industry overview 
the us commercial banking industry has been significantly impacted between and by decreased values in real estate related assets  a downturn in the financial markets and a significant tightening in the credit market 
the weakened us housing market has caused the industry to realize significant losses on write downs of investment securities securitized by real estate and higher credit costs for write downs of loans issued for investment 
the november s p case shiller home price indices data indicated that the real estate market is still struggling 
november was the sixth consecutive month where annual growth rates moderated from the prior month s pace 
in addition  nine metropolitan areas hit their lowest price levels since home prices peaked in and the chairman of the federal reserve indicated in a speech on august   that economic activity that appeared in the second half of has continued  but at a pace lower than projected earlier in the year 
based on the federal reserve s projection of economic activity  it is expected that the current pace of economic activity will accelerate in based on those projections  the unemployment rate would reduce over time 
while consumer spending and business fixed investment continue to restrict economic recovery  business investment in equipment and software increased to a rate of more than in the first half of however  disappointing labor market data coupled with low consumer spending and lower than expected growth in housing indicates that the recovery of output and employment has slowed 
during  the federal reserve continued to take action to encourage growth in the u 
s economy 
in november  the federal reserve announced plans to buy up to billion in long term treasuries during the second quarter of and reiterated its intentions to reinvest up to billion in proceeds from earlier investments  bringing total new investment up to billion 
these stimulus efforts  collectively referred to as the central banks quantitative easing policy  are intended to promote economic growth by keeping access to credit markets open and interest rates low 
the national unemployment rate slightly decreased from in december to as of december the high unemployment rate is another driving factor that could prolong a weak economy 
during  banks failed and went into receivership with the fdic  causing estimated losses of billion to the depository insurance fund 
in  banks went into 
table of contents receivership 
the fdic has also taken possession of banks in the first month of  including two colorado banks 
this compares to only bank failures in the years to the fdic s problem list stood at at september   up from at the end of and at the end of in the third quarter of  fdic insured commercial banks reported a combined net income of billion  the fifth consecutive quarterly year over year earnings improvement 
driving the increase in earnings were reductions in loan loss provisions and goodwill impairments 
provision for loan losses was at the lowest quarterly total since the fourth quarter of net charge offs decreased for the second consecutive quarter as compared to the previous and year earlier quarters 
in addition  noncurrent loans decreased during the quarter after posting the first quarterly decline in more than four years during the second quarter of prior to the second quarter of  noncurrent loan balances had risen for consecutive quarters 
the overall market conditions led the federal open markets committee fomc to maintain the target federal funds rate at a range of to basis points in since it was initially set in december at the january fomc meeting the committee again decided to maintain the target at to basis points since the rate of the economic recovery has been insufficient to bring about a significant improvement in labor market conditions 
company overview 
from december   the first complete fiscal year under the current management team  to december   our organization has grown from a bank holding company with two bank locations and total assets of million to a diversified financial services holding company with bank locations  four fee based businesses and total assets of billion 
as discussed in item business and note to the consolidated financial statements  the company changed its operating segments in to reflect an internal realignment of its wealth management components 
the prior period disclosures in the following table have been adjusted to conform to the new presentation 
certain key metrics of our operating segments at or for the years ended december   and are as follows corporate commercial investment wealth support and banking banking management insurance other consolidated in thousands  except per share data net loss diluted loss per common share total assets net loss diluted loss per common share total assets net income loss diluted earnings loss per common share total assets noted below are some of the significant financial performance measures and operational results for and commercial banking broke even on a per share basis in compared to a loss of per diluted share in our commercial banking franchise recognized provision for loan losses of million in  a significant reduction compared to million in nonperforming assets decreased to million at the end of  from million at the end of the bank s ratio of allowance for loan and credit losses to total loans ended the year at and the allowance exceeds of nonperforming loans 
during the fourth quarter of  the segment recorded a deferred tax valuation charge of million 
also contributing to the improvement was the absence of a goodwill impairment that negatively impacted the results 

table of contents investment banking broke even on a per share basis in  compared to a loss of per diluted share in after muted mergers and acquisition activity in due to the adverse impact of severe macro economic conditions  the segment significantly improved the number of successful deals closed in also contributing to the improvement was the absence of a goodwill impairment that negatively impacted the results 
wealth management lost per diluted share in  an improvement over the loss of in the segment recorded a million deferred tax valuation allowance during most of the major market indices rose during  contributing to higher revenue for the segment 
however  the integration of the company s investment advisory firms into one legal entity and the subsequent marketing campaign of wealth management increased operating expenses 
wealth transfer revenue increased in over  as the economy improved 
also contributing to the improvement was the absence of a goodwill impairment that negatively impacted the results 
insurance lost per diluted share in  an improvement over the loss in a deferred tax valuation allowance of million impacted the segments earnings during the company s p c revenues are generated as a percentage of its client s insurance premiums 
as client payrolls  revenues and business assets have shrunk due to economic conditions  premiums have also decreased 
the company continues to realize lower revenues on a large part of its existing client base 
the improvement in the net loss per share was primarily due to the absence of a goodwill impairment that negatively impacted the results 
corporate support and other lost per diluted share in  down from a loss of in the increase in the net loss per share was primarily due to an million deferred tax valuation charge recorded in the fourth quarter of  a million increase in provision for loan loss expense for non performing assets held at the parent company and a million increase in valuation losses on oreo also held at the parent company 
during the fourth quarter of  the company established a deferred tax asset valuation allowance in the amount of million based on its assessment of the amount of deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized 
the company recognized losses of million in on valuation adjustments of other real estate owned and other than temporary impairments on investments 
the net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis remained steady at compared to in total noninterest bearing demand accounts represented of total deposits at december   the highest level in the company s history 
the company s total risk based capital ratio was to at the end of  down from at the end of the company recognized a million goodwill impairment charge in commercial banking lost per diluted share in  down from a contribution of in our commercial banking franchise recognized provision for loan losses of million in  compared to million in net charge offs for totaled million  compared to million for nonperforming assets also increased to million at the end of  from million at the end of the bank s ratio of allowance for loan and 
table of contents credit losses to total loans ended the year at  the highest ratio the bank has had at the end of a year in its history  and the allowance exceeds of nonperforming loans 
the segment also realized a goodwill impairment charge of million 
the increase in provision for loan loss expense was the primary driver in the decrease in net income for both the commercial banking segment and the company 
the company s land acquisition and development portfolio represented of total loans  but accounted for approximately of the provision for loan losses and of the gross charge offs 
investment banking lost per diluted share in  down from a loss in mergers and acquisition activity was muted in due to the adverse impact of severe macro economic conditions 
the segment also realized a goodwill impairment charge of million 
wealth management lost per diluted share in  down from a loss of in while the major market indices rose during  the market growth did not fully recapture the losses realized in the segment was also adversely impacted by a decrease in wealth transfer cases  as clients conserved cash reserves due to the recession 
the decline in average market values in compared to continued to pressure top line revenue 
the segment also realized a goodwill impairment charge of million 
insurance lost per diluted share in  down from a contribution of in the company s p c revenues are generated as a percentage of its client s insurance premiums 
as client payrolls  revenues and business assets have shrunk due to economic conditions  premiums have also decreased 
thus  the company has realized lower revenues on a large part of its existing client base 
the segment also realized a goodwill impairment charge of million 
corporate support and other lost per diluted share in  down from a loss of in the increase in the net loss per share was primarily due to the inclusion of the preferred stock dividends for a full year in the preferred stock was outstanding for less than a month in in addition  the segment recorded million in provision for loan loss expense for non performing assets held at the parent company 
during the third quarter of  the company successfully completed a common equity offering of million  net of expenses 
the company recognized losses of million in on valuation adjustments of other real estate owned and other than temporary impairments on investments 
the net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis was compared to in the company s total risk based capital ratio increased to at the end of from at the end of bank 
the commercial bank segment  the cornerstone of our franchise  has been adversely impacted by the slowdown in the economy and the tightening in the credit markets over the past three years 
while the bank has recognized elevated levels of loan losses  net charge offs fell to million in from million in both years include net charge offs of loans that were transferred to the parent company 
the negative impact of asset quality not only affected the level of provision for loan losses  but also impacted net interest income as earning assets decreased 
the bank  and the industry as a whole  continues to be challenged by new loan generation 
muted loan growth in the future will negatively impact the bank s earnings as net interest income is the largest driver of operating income 
fee based business lines 
the company s fee based business lines investment banking  insurance  and wealth management operated at a loss for on a combined basis for the second consecutive 
table of contents year 
however  our ratio of noninterest income to total operating revenues increased to for compared to in we believe that through the combination of our commercial banking franchise and our fee based businesses  we are uniquely situated to service our commercial clients throughout their business lifecycle 
we are able to help our customers grow by providing banking services from our bank franchise  capital planning from gmb  and employee and executive benefits packages from fdl 
we can assist in planning for the future with wealth transfer and business succession planning from fdl 
we are able to protect assets with p c insurance from cobiz insurance 
we can facilitate exit and retirement strategies with merger and acquisition services from gmb 
we are also able to preserve our customers wealth with trust and fiduciary services from cobiz trust  investment management services from cobiz investment management  and wealth transfer services from fdl 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this form k beginning on page f for a discussion of the segments included in our principal activities and for certain financial information for each segment  see segment results discussed below and note to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its consolidated financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
in making those critical accounting estimates  we are required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate 
different estimates we could reasonably have used  or changes in the assumptions that could occur  could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or consolidated results of operations 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting policy that requires subjective estimates in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based upon management s periodic review of the collectibilty of loans in light of historical experience  the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
we maintain a loan review program independent of the lending function that is designed to reduce and control risk in the lending function 
it includes the monitoring of lending activities with respect to underwriting and processing new loans  preventing insider abuse  and timely follow up and corrective action for loans showing signs of deterioration in quality 
we also have a systematic process to evaluate individual loans and pools of loans within our loan portfolio 
we maintain a loan grading system whereby each loan is assigned a grade between and  with representing the highest quality credit  representing a loan where collection or liquidation in full is highly questionable and improbable  and representing a loss that has been or will be charged off 
loans that are graded or lower are categorized as non classified credits  while loans graded and higher are categorized as classified credits that have a higher risk of loss 
grades are assigned based upon the degree of risk associated with repayment of a loan in the normal course of business pursuant to the original terms 
loans above a certain dollar amount that are adversely graded are reported to the loan committee and the chief credit officer along with current financial information  a collateral analysis and an action plan 
individual loans that are deemed to be impaired are evaluated in accordance with accounting standards codification asc topic  receivables subsequent measurement 

table of contents in determining the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses  we analyze the various components of the loan portfolio  including all significant credits  on an individual basis 
when analyzing the adequacy  we segment the loan portfolio into components with similar characteristics  such as risk classification  past due status  type of loan  industry or collateral 
possible factors that may impact the allowance for loan losses include  but are not limited to changes in lending policies and procedures  including underwriting standards as well as collection  charge off and recovery practices  changes in national and local economic and business conditions and developments  including the condition of various market segments  changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio  changes in the experience  ability  and depth of lending management and staff  changes in the trend of the volume and severity of past due and classified loans  and trends in the volume of non accrual loans  troubled debt restructurings  and other loan modifications  the existence and effect of any concentrations of credit  and changes in the level of such concentrations  and the effect of external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements on the level of estimated credit losses in the current portfolio 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on management s methodology 
other real estate owned other real estate owned oreo represents properties acquired through foreclosure or physical possession 
write downs to fair value at the time of transfer to oreo are charged to the allowance for loan losses 
subsequent to foreclosure  we periodically evaluate the value of oreo held for sale and record a valuation allowance for any subsequent declines in fair value less selling costs 
subsequent declines in value are charged to operations 
fair value is based on our assessment of information available to us at the end of a reporting period and depends upon a number of factors  including our historical experience  economic conditions  and issues specific to individual properties 
our evaluation of these factors involves subjective estimates and judgments that may change 
recoverability of goodwill asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other asc  requires that we evaluate on an annual basis or whenever events occur which may indicate possible impairment whether any portion of our recorded goodwill is impaired 
the recoverability of goodwill is a critical accounting policy that requires subjective estimates in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill impairment is determined using a two step process 
in the first step  the fair value of a reporting unit is compared to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired and it is not necessary to continue to step two of the impairment process 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount  step two is performed  where the implied fair value of goodwill is compared to the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill 
implied goodwill is computed as a residual value after allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to its assets and liabilities we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using market multiples of comparable entities  including recent transactions  or a combination of market multiples and a discounted cash flow methodology 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires a high degree of subjective management assumption 
discounted cash flow valuation models utilize variables such as revenue growth rates  expense trends  discount rates and terminal values 
based upon an evaluation of key data and market factors  management selects from a range the specific variables to be incorporated into the valuation model 

table of contents we conducted evaluations of our reporting units during due to triggering events noted in the first and third quarters 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the estimated fair value of all reporting units was less than their carrying values and goodwill impairment was deemed to exist 
during  the company recorded a goodwill impairment of million  eliminating all goodwill from the balance sheet 
deferred taxes the company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
if current available information raises doubt as to the realization of the deferred tax assets  a valuation allowance may be established 
we consider the determination of this valuation allowance to be a critical accounting policy because of the need to exercise significant judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets  including projections of future taxable income 
these judgments and estimates are reviewed on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change 
at december   the company has recorded a valuation allowance of million 
an additional valuation allowance for deferred tax assets may be required if the amounts of taxes recoverable through loss carry backs decline  if we project lower levels of future taxable income  or we project lower levels of tax planning strategies 
such additional valuation allowance would be established through a charge to income tax expense that would adversely affect our operating results 
share based payments on january   we adopted guidance now included in asc topic  compensation stock compensation asc originally issued as sfas no 
r  share based payment  using the modified prospective method 
under this method  compensation cost is recognized for all awards granted after the required effective date and to awards modified  cancelled or repurchased after that date and the portion of prior awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered  based on the grant date fair value of those awards calculated for pro forma disclosures under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
asc requires that the cash retained as a result of the tax deductibility of employee share based awards be presented as a component of cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
under asc  we use the black scholes option valuation model to determine the fair value of our stock options as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the black scholes fair value model includes various assumptions  including the expected volatility  expected life and expected dividend rate of the options 
in addition  the company is required to estimate the amount of options issued that are expected to be forfeited 
these assumptions reflect our best estimates  but they involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside of our control 
as a result  if other assumptions had been used  stock based compensation expense  as calculated and recorded under asc  could have been materially impacted 
furthermore  if we use different assumptions in future periods  stock based compensation expense could be materially impacted in future periods 
fair value the company has adopted asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures asc originally issued as sfas no 
 fair value measurements  as it applies to financial assets and liabilities effective january  asc defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements 
fair value is defined under asc as the exchange price that would be received for an 
table of contents asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
as a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements  asc establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity observable inputs that are classified within levels and of the hierarchy and the reporting entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions unobservable inputs classified within level of the hierarchy 
fair value may be used on a recurring basis for certain assets and liabilities such as available for sale securities and derivatives in which fair value is the primary basis of accounting 
similarly  fair value may be used on a nonrecurring basis to evaluate certain assets or liabilities such as impaired loans 
depending on the nature of the asset or liability  the company uses various valuation techniques and assumptions in accordance with asc to determine the instrument s fair value 
at december   million of total assets  consisting of million in available for sale securities and million in derivative instruments  represented assets recorded at fair value on a recurring basis 
at december   million of total assets  consisting of million in available for sale securities and million in derivative instruments  represented assets recorded at fair value on a recurring basis 
at december  and  million and million  respectively  of total liabilities represented derivative instruments recorded at fair value on a recurring basis 
assets recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis consisted of impaired loans totaling million at december  certain private label mbs valued using broker dealer quotes based on proprietary broker models  which are considered by the company an unobservable input level  totaled million of total assets at december  and the company recognized million and million in other than temporary impairments on the private label mbs for the year ended december  and  respectively 
for additional information on the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we also have other policies that we consider to be significant accounting policies  however  these policies  which are disclosed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  do not meet the definition of critical accounting policies because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 
recent accounting pronouncements effective january   the company adopted the guidance in asu no 
 fair value measurements and disclosures topic improving disclosures about fair value measurements asu  which adds new requirements for disclosures for levels and  separate disclosures of purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements relating to level measurements and clarification of existing fair value disclosures 
asu was effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december   except for the requirement to provide level activity of purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements on a gross basis  was effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of the update effective in did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
the company is evaluating the effect  if any  the update effective in will have on the consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued asu no 
 disclosures about the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses asu 
asu is intended to provide financial statement users with greater transparency about the nature of credit risk in an entity s portfolio of financing receivables  how risk is analyzed in arriving at the allowance for credit losses  and the changes and reasons for those changes in the allowance for credit losses 
asu is effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after december   except for certain disclosures related to activity occurring during a reporting period which was effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  the adoption of the update effective in did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
the company is evaluating the effect  if any  the update effective in will have on the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents financial condition the company had total assets of billion and total liabilities of billion at december   compared to billion in assets and billion in liabilities at december  the following sections address the specific components of the balance sheets and significant matters relating to those components at and for the years ended december  and lending activities general 
we provide a broad range lending services  including commercial loans  commercial and residential real estate construction loans  commercial and residential real estate mortgage loans  consumer loans  revolving lines of credit  and tax exempt financing 
our primary lending focus is commercial and real estate lending to small and medium sized businesses with annual sales of million to million  and businesses and individuals with borrowing requirements of  to million 
at december   substantially all of our outstanding loans were to customers within colorado and arizona 
interest rates charged on loans vary with the degree of risk  maturity  underwriting and servicing costs  principal amount  and extent of other banking relationships with the customer 
interest rates are further subject to competitive pressures  money market rates  availability of funds  and government regulations 
see net interest income for an analysis of the interest rates on our loans 
credit procedures and review 
we address credit risk through internal credit policies and procedures  including underwriting criteria  officer and customer lending limits  a multi layered loan approval process for larger loans  periodic document examination  justification for any exceptions to credit policies  loan review and concentration monitoring 
in response to current conditions and heightened default risk due to depressed real estate and collateral values  management expanded the resources of the credit and loan review departments to provide for a more proactive identification of problem credits 
in addition  we provide ongoing loan officer training and review 
we have a continuous loan review process designed to promote early identification of credit quality problems  assisted by a dedicated senior credit officer in each geographic market 
all loan officers are charged with the responsibility of reviewing  at least on a monthly basis  all past due loans in their respective portfolios 
in addition  each of the loan officers establishes a watch list of loans to be reviewed by the boards of directors of the bank 
the loan portfolio is also monitored regularly by a loan review department that reports to the chief operations officer of the company and submits reports directly to the audit committee of the board of directors and the credit administration department 
in order to effectively respond to the current credit cycle  declining asset quality and increasing foreclosures  the company made a significant investment in to establish a special assets group comprised of seasoned specialists to efficiently manage nonperforming assets 
management believes having the specialized function will allow our bankers to focus on seeking new lending and deposit relationships while troubled asset levels are effectively managed 
composition of loan portfolio 
the following table sets forth the composition of our loan portfolio at the dates indicated 
at december  in thousands amount amount amount amount amount commercial real estate mortgage land acquisition development real estate construction consumer other total loans less allowance for loan losses net loans held for investment loans held for sale net loans gross loans decreased million to billion at december  the decline in the overall gross loan balance is primarily attributable to a decrease in the land acquisition and development loan 
table of contents portfolio  which contributed to or million of the overall decline of the loan portfolio 
due to overall market illiquidity and the significant value declines on raw land  the company has ceased lending activities for the acquisition and future development of land 
the real estate mortgage and real estate construction loan portfolios decreased significantly during  million and million  respectively 
the aforementioned declines were offset by increases in other loan categories  primarily the consumer loan category 
the growth in the consumer loan portfolio is due to a new product offering  jumbo mortgage loans million at december  
the recent adverse economic conditions have contributed to a challenging operating environment and a downward trend in loan demand 
however  the shift in loan concentration is primarily attributed to successful efforts to further diversify the company s loan portfolio 
the company s primary focus was to reduce high risk loan concentration levels and grow other loan categories mainly by exploring new niche lending opportunities 
gross loans decreased million to billion at december  the decline was driven by customer paydowns in each major category of the portfolio outpacing new loan demand and the increased level of charge offs 
loan generation slowed in as businesses de leveraged their balance sheets and accumulated cash reserves in response to economic factors 
the decrease in total loans was equally shared between the colorado and arizona markets 
under state law  the aggregate amount of loans we can make to one borrower is generally limited to of our unimpaired capital  surplus  undivided profits and allowance for loan losses 
at december   our individual legal lending limit was million 
the bank s board of directors has established an internal lending limit of million for normal credit extensions and million for the highest rated credit types 
to accommodate customers whose financing needs exceed our internal lending limits and to address portfolio concentration concerns  we sell loan participations to outside participants 
at december  and  the outstanding balance of loan participations sold by us was million and million  respectively 
at december  and  we had loan participations purchased from other banks totaling million and million  respectively 
we use the same analysis in deciding whether or not to purchase a participation in a loan as we would in deciding whether to originate the same loan 
due to the nature of our business as a commercial banking institution  our lending relationships are typically larger than those of a retail bank 
the following table describes the number of relationships and the percentage of the dollar value of the loan portfolio by the size of the credit relationship 
number of of number of of number of of credit relationships relationships loan portfolio relationships loan portfolio relationships loan portfolio greater than million million to million million to million million to million less than million the majority of the loan relationships exceeding million are in our real estate and commercial portfolios 
at december    and  there were no concentrations of loans related to any single industry in excess of of total loans 
the company may be subject to additional regulatory supervisory oversight if its concentration in commercial real estate lending exceeds regulatory parameters 
pursuant to interagency guidance issued by the federal reserve and other federal banking agencies  supervisory criteria were put in place to define commercial real estate concentrations as construction  land development and other land loans that represent or more of total risk based capital  or commercial real estate loans as defined in the guidance that represent or more of total risk based capital and the real estate portfolio has increased more than or more during the prior months 

table of contents at december   the company had reduced its exposure to commercial real estate lending below the parameters discussed above 
however  at december   the company was considered to have a commercial real estate concentration 
in the ordinary course of business  we enter into various types of transactions that include commitments to extend credit 
we apply the same credit standards to these commitments as we apply to our other lending activities and have included these commitments in our lending risk evaluations 
our exposure to credit loss under commitments to extend credit is represented by the amount of these commitments 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on our commitments 
commercial loans 
commercial loans increased million  or  from million at december  to million at december  commercial lending consists of loans to small and medium sized businesses in a wide variety of industries

however  where warranted by the overall financial condition of the borrower  loans may be unsecured and based on the cash flow of the business 
terms of commercial loans generally range from one to five years  and the majority of such loans have floating interest rates

real estate mortgage loans decreased million  or  from million at december  to million at december  real estate mortgage loans include various types of loans for which we hold real property as collateral 
we generally restrict commercial real estate lending activity to owner occupied properties or to investor properties that are owned by customers with which we have a current banking relationship 
we make commercial real estate loans at both fixed and floating interest rates  with maturities generally ranging from five to years 
the bank s underwriting standards generally require that a commercial real estate loan not exceed of the appraised value of the property securing the loan

land acquisition and development loans decreased million  or  from million at december  to million at december  we have a portfolio of loans for the acquisition and development of land for residential building projects 
due to overall market illiquidity and the significant value declines on raw land  the company has ceased lending activities for the acquisition and future development of land 
however  the company may still pursue loans secured by finished lots that are prepared to enter the construction phase 
land acquisition and development loans may be more adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy 
the company continued its focus on reducing its exposure to this portfolio in this portfolio has been continuously decreasing since  when it comprised or million of the total loan portfolio 
the properties securing the land acquisition and development portfolio are generally located in the states of arizona and colorado 
at december  and  the majority approximately of the loans were generated in the colorado market 
real estate construction loans 
real estate construction loans decreased million  or  from million at december  to million at december  we originate loans to finance construction projects involving one to four family residences 
we provide financing to residential developers that we believe have demonstrated a favorable record of accurately projecting completion dates and budgeting expenses 
we provide loans for the construction of both pre sold projects and projects built prior to the location of a specific buyer speculative loan  although speculative loans are provided on a more selective basis 
residential construction loans are due upon the sale of the completed project and are generally collateralized by first liens on the real estate and have floating interest rates 
in addition  these loans are generally secured by personal guarantees to provide an additional source of repayment 
we generally require a permanent financing commitment or prequalification be in place before we make a residential construction loan 
moreover  we generally monitor construction draws monthly and inspect property to ensure that construction is progressing as projected 
our underwriting standards generally require that the principal amount of a speculative loan be no more than of the appraised value of the completed construction project or of pre sold projects 
values are determined primarily by approved independent appraisers 
with the deep valuation declines in the real estate markets during recent years  the company has become very selective in the extension of credit for new construction projects 
we also originate loans to finance the construction of multi family  office  industrial  retail and tax credit projects 
these projects are predominantly owned by the user of the property  or are sponsored by financially strong developers who maintain an ongoing banking relationship with us 
our underwriting standards generally require that the principal amount of these loans be no more than of the appraised value 
values are determined primarily by approved independent appraisers 
the properties securing the company s real estate loan portfolio are generally located in the states of arizona and colorado

table of contents   and adjustable rate mortgage loans and broker and year fixed products 
jumbo mortgage loans at december   totaled million or of the consumer loan portfolio 
nonperforming assets our nonperforming assets consist of nonaccrual loans  restructured loans  loans past due days or more  oreo and other repossessed assets 
nonaccrual loans are those loans for which the accrual of interest has been discontinued 
impaired loans are defined as loans for which  based on current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement all of which were on a non accrual basis 
the following table sets forth information with respect to these assets at the dates indicated 
at december  in thousands nonperforming loans loans days or more delinquent and still accruing interest nonaccrual loans commercial real estate mortgage land acquisition development real estate construction consumer and other total nonaccrual loans total nonperforming loans oreo and repossessed assets total nonperforming assets allowance for loan losses allowance for credit losses allowance for loan and credit losses ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans ratio of nonperforming loans and oreo to total loans and oreo ratio of allowance for loan and credit losses to total loans ratio of allowance for loan and credit losses to nonperforming loans accrual of interest is discontinued on a loan when management believes  after considering economic and business conditions and collection efforts  the borrower s financial condition is such that the collection of interest is doubtful 
a delinquent loan is generally placed on nonaccrual status when it becomes days past due 
when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  all accrued and unpaid interest on the loan is reversed and deducted from earnings as a reduction of reported interest income 
no additional interest is accrued on the loan balance until the collection of both principal and interest becomes reasonably certain 
when the issues relating to a nonaccrual loan are finally resolved  there may ultimately be an actual write down or charge off of the principal balance of the loan  which may necessitate additional charges to earnings 
restructured loans are those for which concessions  including the reduction of interest rates below a rate otherwise available to the borrower  or the reduction of interest or principal  have been granted due to the borrower s weakened financial condition 
interest on restructured loans is accrued at the restructured rates when it is anticipated that no loss of original principal will occur 
interest income that would have been recorded had nonaccrual loans performed in accordance with their original contract terms during  and  was million  million and million  respectively 
oreo represents real property taken by the bank either through foreclosure or through a deed in lieu thereof from the borrower 
repossessed assets include vehicles and other commercial assets acquired under agreements with delinquent borrowers

in addition to the nonperforming assets described above  the company had customer relationships considered by management to be potential problem loans with outstanding principal of approximately million 
a potential problem loan is one as to which management has concerns about the borrower s future performance under the terms of the loan contract 
for our protection  management monitors these loans closely 
these loans are current as to the principal and interest and  accordingly  are not included in the nonperforming asset categories 
however  further deterioration may result in the loan being classified as nonperforming 
the level of potential problem loans is factored into the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
analysis of allowance for loan and credit losses 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s recognition of the risks of extending credit and its evaluation of the quality of the loan portfolio 
the allowance is maintained to provide for probable credit losses related to specifically identified loans and for losses inherent in the loan portfolio that have been incurred at the balance sheet date 
the allowance is based on various factors affecting the loan portfolio  including a review of problem loans  business conditions  historical loss experience  evaluation of the quality of the underlying collateral  and holding and disposal costs 
the allowance is increased additional charges to operating income and reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries 
the allowance for credit losses represents management s recognition of a separate reserve for off balance sheet loan commitments and letters of credit 
while the allowance for loan losses is recorded as a contra asset to the loan portfolio on the consolidated balance sheets  the allowance for credit losses is recorded in accrued interest and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
although the allowances are presented separately on the consolidated balance sheets  any losses incurred from credit losses would be reported as a charge off in the allowance for loan losses  since any loss would be recorded after the off balance sheet commitment had been funded 
due to the relationship of these allowances  as extensions of credit underwritten through a comprehensive risk analysis  information on both the allowance for loan and credit losses positions is presented in the following table 

table of contents for the year ended december  in thousands balance of allowance for loan losses at beginning of period charge offs commercial real estate mortgage land acquisition development real estate construction consumer other total charge offs recoveries commercial real estate mortgage land acquisition development real estate construction consumer other total recoveries net charge offs recoveries provision for loan losses charged to operations balance of allowance for loan losses at end of period balance of allowance for credit losses at beginning of period provision credit for credit losses charged to operations balance of allowance for credit losses at end of period total provision for loan and credit losses charged to operations ratio of net charge offs recoveries to average loans average loans outstanding during the period additions to the allowances for loan and credit losses  which are charged as expenses on our consolidated statements of operations  are made periodically to maintain the allowances at the appropriate level  based on our analysis of the potential risk in the loan and commitment portfolios 
loans charged off  net of amounts recovered from previously charged off loans  reduce the allowance for loan losses 
the amount of the allowance is a function of the levels of loans outstanding  the level of nonperforming loans  historical loan loss experience  amount of loan losses charged against the reserve during a given period and current economic conditions 
federal regulatory agencies  as part of their examination process  review our loans and allowance for loan and credit losses 
we believe that our allowance for loan and credit losses is adequate to cover anticipated loan and credit losses 
however  management may determine a need to increase the allowances for loan and credit losses  or regulators  when reviewing the bank s loan and commitment portfolio in the future  may request the bank increase such allowances 
either of these events could adversely affect our earnings 
further  there can be no assurance that actual loan and credit losses will not exceed the allowances for loan and credit losses 
the allowance for loan losses consists of three elements i specific reserves determined in accordance with asc topic receivables formerly fas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan based on probable losses on specific loans  ii general reserves determined in accordance with guidance in asc topic contingencies formerly sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  based on historical loan loss experience adjusted for other qualitative risk factors both internal and external to the company  and iii unallocated reserves 
the methodology used in the periodic review of reserve adequacy  which is performed at least quarterly  is designed to be dynamic and responsive to changes in actual and expected credit losses 
these changes are reflected in both the general and unallocated reserves 
the historical loss ratios and 
table of contents estimated risk factors related to segmenting our loan portfolio  which are key considerations in this analysis  are updated quarterly and are weighted more heavily for recent economic conditions 
the review of reserve adequacy is performed by executive management and presented to the audit committee quarterly for its review and consideration 
for additional information on the company s methodology for estimated the allowance for loan and credit losses  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the table below provides an allocation of the allowance for loan and credit losses by loan and commitment type  however  allocation of a portion of the allowance to one category of loans does not preclude its availability to absorb losses in other categories at december  loans in loans in loans in loans in loans in category as a category as a category as a category as a category as a amount of of total amount of of total amount of of total amount of of total amount of of total in thousands allowance gross loans allowance gross loans allowance gross loans allowance gross loans allowance gross loans commercial real estate mortgage land acquisition development real estate construction consumer other unallocated off balance sheet commitments total we believe that any allocation of the allowance into categories creates an appearance of precision that does not exist 
the allocation table should not be interpreted as an indication of the specific amounts  by loan classification  to be charged to the allowance 
we believe that the table is a useful device for assessing the adequacy of the allowance as a whole 
the allowance is utilized as a single unallocated allowance available for all loans 
the land acquisition and development portfolio has been identified by the company as a higher risk loan category 
due to overall market illiquidity and the significant value declines on raw land  the company has ceased lending activities for the acquisition and future development of land 
the quality of this category is highly dependent on property values both in terms of the likelihood of repayment once the property is transacted by the current owner as well as the level of collateral the company has securing the loan in the event of default 
loans in this category are characterized by the speculative nature of commercial and residential development properties and can include property in various stages of development from raw land to finished lots 
management relies heavily on recent loss experience in determining risk in the category which it believes provides a more accurate gauge of actual risk given the negative trends in the current economic cycle 
economic conditions that began to deteriorate in late worsened in with high profile bankruptcies  government orchestrated mergers and a freeze in the credit markets 
conditions continued to worsen in with broad economic declines  historically high unemployment rates  continued devaluation of real estate and severe credit defaults 
in  the slight economic recovery was reflected in the financial industry s overall performance as quarterly provision levels reached the lowest level since the fourth quarter in additionally  year over year quarterly earnings improved during overall nonaccrual loan balances for the industry started declining in the second quarter of resulting in lower levels of net charge offs in most loan categories 
the provision for loan and credit losses of the company decreased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  in  net charge offs exceeded provision for loan and credit losses by million while in the company provided million more in provision for loan and credit losses than net charge offs 
the decreasing provision levels during are primarily the result of improved asset quality 
the company s allowance for loan and credit losses to total loans was and at december  and  respectively 
the allowance for loan and credit losses to nonperforming loans increased from at december   to at december  we believe that our allowance for loan and credit losses is adequate to cover anticipated loan and credit losses 
however  due to 
table of contents changes in the factors considered by management in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan and credit losses  it is possible management may determine a need to increase the allowance for loan and credit losses 
such determination could have an adverse effect in the level of future loan and credit loss provisions and the company s earnings 
investments our investment portfolio is comprised primarily of securities issued by government sponsored entities or securities rated a or better by various nationally recognized rating agencies  with the majority of the portfolio either maturing or repricing within one to five years 
our practice is to purchase primarily us government agency backed mortgages and debentures 
our investment strategies are reviewed in bi monthly meetings of the asset liability management committee 
our mortgage backed securities are typically classified as available for sale

we offer a variety of accounts for depositors  which are designed to attract both short and long term deposits

at december   noninterest bearing deposits increased million or to million compared to the prior year ending balance 
growth in this deposit class has increased million or since december  we believe we receive a large amount of noninterest bearing deposits because we provide customers the option of paying for treasury management services in cash or by maintaining additional noninterest bearing account balances 
the company s noninterest bearing deposits represented more than of total deposits at december   and have been at least of total core deposits in that class since the end of the company participated in the tlgp created by the fdic through its expiration on december   which provided full coverage for noninterest bearing deposit accounts regardless of the dollar amount

in  a provision in the eesa temporarily raised the limit on federal deposit insurance coverage to at least  per depositor 
the dodd frank act made the  limit permanent  retroactive to we believe the combined results of the higher deposit insurance limits and the deposit gathering efforts of our bankers played a significant part in the growth of the deposit base over the past two years allowing the company to reduce its reliance on short term borrowings and wholesale deposit arrangements 
the dodd frank act repeal of the prohibition of paying interest on demand deposits may impact the future balance of the company s noninterest bearing demand and eurodollar deposits

the largest component of our net income is our net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income  principally from loans and investment securities  and interest expense  principally on customer deposits and borrowings 
changes in net interest income result from changes in volume  net interest spread and net interest margin 
volume refers to the average dollar levels of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest spread refers to the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin refers to net interest income divided by average interest earning assets and is influenced by the level and relative mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 

table of contents as the majority of our assets are interest earning and our liabilities are interest bearing  changes in interest rates may impact our net interest margin 
the federal open markets committee fomc uses the federal funds rate  which is the interest rate used by banks to lend to each other  to influence interest rates and the national economy

liquidity and capital resources liquidity refers to the company s ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet financial obligations to its customers and shareholders in order to fund loans  to respond to deposit outflows and to cover operating expenses 
the goal of our liquidity management is to maintain a level of liquid funds 
through proactive asset liability management to ensure that these needs are met at a reasonable cost 
liquidity is essential to compensate for fluctuations in the balance sheet and provide funds for growth and normal operating expenditures 
sources of funds include customer deposits  scheduled amortization of loans  loan prepayments  scheduled maturities of investments and cash flows from mortgage backed securities 
liquidity needs may also be met by deposit growth  converting assets into cash  raising funds in the brokered cd market or borrowing using lines of credit with correspondent banks  the fhlb  the frb or the treasury 
longer term liquidity needs may be met by selling securities available for sale or raising additional capital 
liquidity is monitored and closely managed by the company s asset and liability committee alco  a group of senior officers from the lending  deposit gathering  finance and treasury areas 
alco s primary responsibilities are to ensure the necessary level of funds are available for normal operations as well as maintain a contingency funding policy to ensure that liquidity stress events are quickly identified and management plans are in place to respond 
this is accomplished through the use of policies which establish limits and require measurements to monitor liquidity trends  including management reporting that identifies the amounts and costs of all available funding sources 
the company s current liquidity position is expected to be more than adequate to fund expected asset growth 
historically  our primary source of funds has been customer deposits 
scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds  while deposit inflows and unscheduled loan prepayments which are influenced by fluctuations in the general level of interest rates  returns available on other investments  competition  economic conditions  and other factors are less predictable 
available funding through correspondent lines at december   totaled million  which represents of the company s earning assets 
available funding is comprised of million in 
table of contents available federal funds purchased lines and million in fhlb borrowing capacity 
in addition  the company had million in securities available to be pledged for collateral for additional fhlb borrowings at december  liquidity from asset categories is provided through cash and interest bearing deposits with other banks  which totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
additional asset liquidity sources include principal and interest payments from securities in the company s investment portfolio and cash flows from its amortizing loan portfolio 
liability liquidity sources include attracting deposits at competitive rates 
our loan portfolio decreased million or to billion at december  the company s loan to core deposit ratio decreased to at december   from at december  the combination of the decline in the loan portfolio and the increase in the average deposit portfolio has allowed the company to reduce its wholesale borrowings short term borrowings and brokered cds to an average of million in from an average of million during the company uses various forms of short term borrowings for cash management and liquidity purposes 
these forms of borrowings include federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase  borrowings from the fhlb and revolving lines of credit 
at december   the bank has approved unsecured federal funds purchase lines with six correspondent banks with an aggregate credit line of million 
the company regularly uses its federal funds purchase lines to manage its daily cash position 
however  availability to access funds through those lines is dependent upon the cash position of the correspondent banks and there may be times when certain lines are not available 
in addition  certain lines require a one day rest period after a specified number of consecutive days of accessing the lines 
with the overall tightening in the credit markets  certain correspondent lines have been reduced or may not be available due to liquidity issues specific to our correspondents 
during  the company s aggregate correspondent credit lines decreased million due to three lines becoming unavailable during the year 
the bank also has a line of credit from the fhlb that is limited by the amount of eligible collateral available to secure it 
borrowings under the fhlb line are required to be secured by unpledged securities and qualifying loans 
borrowings may also be used on a longer term basis to support expanded lending activities and to match the maturity or repricing intervals of assets 
at the holding company level  our primary sources of funds are dividends paid from the bank and fee based subsidiaries  management fees assessed to the bank and the fee based business lines  proceeds from the issuance of common or preferred stock  and other capital markets activity 
the main use of this liquidity is the quarterly payment of dividends on our common and preferred stock  quarterly interest payments on the subordinated debentures and notes payable  payments for mergers and acquisitions activity including potential earn out payments  and payments for the salaries and benefits for the employees of the holding company 
in march  the company reduced its quarterly dividend payment from per share to per share in order to preserve its capital base 
the reduction in the quarterly dividend saved the company approximately million per year based on shares outstanding at the date of the dividend reduction 
the approval of the colorado state banking board is required prior to the declaration of any dividend by the bank if the total of all dividends declared by the bank in any calendar year exceeds the total of its net profits for that year combined with the retained net profits for the preceding two years 
in addition  the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of provides that the bank cannot pay a dividend if it will cause the bank to be undercapitalized 
at december   the bank was restricted in its ability to pay dividends to the holding company as its cumulative earnings during and the prior two years  net of dividends paid during those years  was negative 
the company s ability to pay dividends on its common stock depends upon the availability of dividends from the bank  earnings from its fee based businesses  and upon the company s compliance with the capital adequacy guidelines of the federal reserve board of governors see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
however  at december   the company had the ability to continue paying dividends due to the significant amount of capital raised by the parent company in at december   the parent company had a cash balance of million 

table of contents our primary source of shareholders equity is the retention of our net after tax earnings and proceeds from the issuance of common stock 
on july   the company completed an underwritten public placement of  shares of the company s common stock including an underwriter s option at a price of per share 
the offering provided net proceeds to the company of approximately million after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses 
the proceeds have been and will continue to be used to support the growth and related capital needs of the bank  expand our operations through new de novo branch offices  fund possible acquisitions  and fund working capital needs 
at december   shareholders equity decreased to million from million at december  the decrease was primarily due to a net loss of million  dividends paid on preferred stock of million  dividends paid on common stock of million and a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income of million due mainly to unrealized losses on derivatives 
the aforementioned decreases were offset million in stock based compensation and million of stock options  excess tax benefits on option exercises and employee stock purchase plan activity 
the company successfully completed a private placement of million of subordinated unsecured promissory notes during the third and fourth quarters of proceeds from the offering were used for general corporate purposes 
the notes qualify as tier capital for regulatory capital purposes 
management believes the company continues to have good internal capital generation to support its operations 
we currently anticipate that our cash and cash equivalents  expected cash flows from operations are sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for working capital  loan originations  capital expenditures and other obligations for at least the next months 
we continually monitor existing and alternative financing sources to support our capital and liquidity needs  including but not limited to  debt issuance  common stock issuance and deposit funding sources 
based on our current financial condition and our results of operations  we believe that the company will be able to sustain its ability to raise adequate capital through one of these financing sources 
we are subject to minimum risk based capital limitations as set forth by federal banking regulations at both the consolidated company level and the bank level 
under the risk based capital guidelines  different categories of assets  including certain off balance sheet items  such as loan commitments in excess of one year and letters of credit  are assigned different risk weights  based generally on the perceived credit risk of the asset 
these risk weights are multiplied by corresponding asset balances to determine a risk weighted asset base 
for purposes of the risk based capital guidelines  total capital is defined as the sum of tier and tier capital elements  with tier capital being limited to of tier capital 
tier capital includes  with certain restrictions  common shareholders equity  perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries

in order to comply with the regulatory capital constraints  the company and its board of directors constantly monitor the capital level and its anticipated needs based on the company s growth 
the company has identified sources of additional capital that could be used if needed  and monitors the costs and benefits of these sources  which include both the public and private markets 
the company has issued a total of million of trust preferred securities through statutory trusts that are not included in the company s consolidated financial statements 
although the accounts of the statutory trust  capital trust ii and capital trust iii are not included in the company s consolidated financial statements  million in trust preferred securities issued by the trusts are included in tier capital for regulatory capital purposes as allowed by the federal reserve board at december  the remaining million in trust preferred securities is included in tier capital at december  on march   the federal reserve board finalized a rule that would continue to allow the inclusion of trust preferred securities issued by unconsolidated subsidiary trusts in tier capital  but with stricter 
table of contents quantitative and qualitative standards 
under the rule  after a transition period ending on march   the aggregate amount of trust preferred securities and certain other capital elements would be limited to of tier capital elements  net of goodwill that has been reduced by any associated deferred tax liability 
the amount of trust preferred securities and certain other elements in excess of the limit could be included in tier capital  subject to certain restrictions 
on march   the federal reserve board announced the adoption of a final rule that delays the initial effective date of march   to march  upon adoption of this rule  the company would still maintain its well capitalized status 
the company s consolidated financial statements do not reflect various off balance sheet commitments that are made in the normal course of business  which may involve some liquidity risk 
off balance sheet arrangements are discussed in the following contractual obligations and commitments section 
the company has commitments to extend credit under lines of credit and stand by letters of credit 
the company has also committed to investing in certain partnerships

the preferred shares are shown in the table as being due in the after one but within three years category which assumes the million in preferred stock will be redeemed in the year prior to the contractual dividend rate step up to effective in december the company has employed a strategy to expand its offering of fee based products through the acquisition of entities that complement its business model 
we will often structure the purchase price of an acquired entity to include an earn out  which is a contingent payment based on achieving future performance levels 
given the uncertainty of today s economic climate and the performance challenges it creates for companies  we feel the use of earn outs in acquisitions is an effective method to bridge the expectation gap between a buyer s caution and a seller s optimism 
earn outs help to protect buyers from paying a full valuation up front without the assurance of the acquisition s performance  while allowing sellers to participate in the full value of the company provided the anticipated performance does occur 

table of contents since the earn out payments are determined based on the acquired company s performance during the earn out period  the total payments to be made are not known at the time of the acquisition 
the company had committed to make additional earn out payments to the former owners of wagner based on earnings and performance 
at december   the company did not accrue for any earn out payments for the fiscal year and all obligations for earn out payments have expired 
no amount was earned under the earn out arrangements for the years ended december  or the company  at the time of the purchase of the assets of bda  placed into escrow million as deferred purchase price that could be earned by achieving certain agreed upon performance measures over the two year period following the acquisition 
at december   it was determined the unit had met the first of two performance measures and in january million of the deferred purchase price was released to the former owners 
at december   performance measures were not met  no additional amounts were earned under the deferred purchase price arrangement and the remaining million was released from escrow to the company and no further potential payments exist under the agreement 
the contractual amount of the company s financial instruments with off balance sheet risk  expiring by period at december   is presented below after one after three within but within but within after in thousands one year three years five years five years total unfunded loan commitments standby letters of credit commercial letters of credit unfunded commitments for unconsolidated investments company guarantees total commitments the company is party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the liquidity  credit enhancement and financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments include legally binding commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit and involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized on the balance sheet 
credit risk is the principal risk associated with these instruments 
the contractual amounts of these instruments represent the amount of credit risk should the instruments be fully drawn upon and the customer defaults 
to control the credit risk associated with entering into commitments and issuing letters of credit  the company uses the same credit quality  collateral policies and monitoring controls in making commitments and letters of credit as it does with its lending activities 
the company evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained  if deemed necessary by the company upon extension of credit  is based on management s credit evaluation 
legally binding commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments may expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
standby letters of credit obligate the company to meet certain financial obligations of its customers if  under the contractual terms of the agreement  the customers are unable to do so 
the financial standby letters of credit issued by the company are irrevocable 
payment is only guaranteed under these letters of credit upon the borrower s failure to perform its obligations to the beneficiary 
approximately million of total commitments at december   represent commitments to extend credit at fixed rates of interest  which exposes the company to some degree of interest rate risk 
the company has also entered into interest rate swap agreements under which it is required to either receive or pay cash to a counterparty depending on changes in interest rates 
the interest rate swaps are

interest rate swaps recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at december   do not represent amounts that will ultimately be received or paid under the contract and are therefore excluded from the table above 
effects of inflation and changing prices the primary impact of inflation on our operations is increased operating costs 
unlike most retail or manufacturing companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution such as the company are monetary in nature 
as a result  the impact of interest rates on a financial institution s performance is generally greater than the impact of inflation 
although interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction  or to the same extent  as the prices of goods and services  increases in inflation generally have resulted in increased interest rates 
over short periods of time  interest rates may not move in the same direction  or at the same magnitude  as inflation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset liability management asset liability management is concerned with the timing and magnitude of repricing assets compared to liabilities 
it is our objective to generate stable growth in net interest income and to attempt to control risks associated with interest rate movements 
in general  our strategy is to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income by maintaining a favorable match between the maturities or repricing dates of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
we adjust interest sensitivity during the year through changes in the mix of assets and liabilities 
our asset and liability management strategy is formulated and monitored by the alco committee  in accordance with policies approved by the board of directors of the bank 
this committee meets regularly to review  among other things  the sensitivity of our assets and liabilities to interest rate changes  the book and market values of assets and liabilities  unrealized gains and losses  purchase and sale activity  and maturities of investments and borrowings 
the alco committee also approves and establishes pricing and funding decisions with respect to our overall asset and liability composition 
the committee reviews our liquidity  cash flow flexibility  maturities of investments  deposits and borrowings  deposit activity  current market conditions  and general levels of interest rates 
to effectively measure and manage interest rate risk  we use simulation analysis to determine the impact on net interest income of changes in interest rates under various interest rate scenarios 
from these simulations  interest rate risk is quantified and appropriate strategies are developed and implemented 
the following table presents an analysis of the interest rate sensitivity inherent in our net interest income for the next months and market value of equity 
the interest rate scenario presented in the table includes interest rates at december   as adjusted by rate changes upward of up to basis points ramped over a month period 
due to the current interest rate environment  the fomc has a basis point target federal funds rate at december   with prime set at basis points above the fomc target  the downward movement analysis was limited to a basis point change 
the market value sensitivity analysis presented includes assumptions that i the composition of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities existing at december   will remain constant  and ii that changes in market rates are parallel and instantaneous across the yield curve regardless of duration or repricing characteristics of specific assets or liabilities 
further  the analysis does not contemplate any actions that we might undertake in response to changes in market interest rates 
accordingly  this analysis is not intended to and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect actual changes in market rates will have on us 

table of contents change in interest rates in basis points impact on net interest income n a market value of equity n a our results of operations depend significantly on net interest income 
like most financial institutions  our interest income and cost of funds are affected by general economic conditions and by competition in the marketplace 
rising and falling interest rate environments can have various impacts on net interest income  depending on the interest rate profile ie  the difference between the repricing of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the relative changes in interest rates that occur when various assets and liabilities reprice  unscheduled repayments of loans and investments  early withdrawals of deposits  and other factors 
as a general rule  banks with positive interest rate gaps are more likely to be susceptible to declines in net interest income in periods of falling interest rates  while banks with negative interest rate gaps are more likely to experience declines in net interest income in periods of rising interest rates 
at december   our cumulative interest rate gap was a positive 
therefore  assuming no change in our gap position  a rise in interest rates is likely to result in increased net interest income  while a decline in interest rates is likely to result in decreased net interest income 
this is a point in time position that is continually changing and is not indicative of our position at any other time 
while the gap position is a useful tool in measuring interest rate risk and contributes toward effective asset and liability management  shortcomings are inherent in gap analysis since certain assets and liabilities may not move proportionally as interest rates change 
consequently  in addition to gap analysis  we use the simulation model discussed above to test the interest rate sensitivity of net interest income and the balance sheet 
the following table sets forth the estimated maturity or repricing  and the resulting interest rate gap  of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  all amounts in the table are based on contractual repricing schedules 
actual prepayment and withdrawal experience may vary significantly from the assumptions reflected in the table

table of contents to manage the relationship of our interest earning assets and liabilities  we evaluate the following factors liquidity  equity  debt capital ratio  anticipated prepayment rates  portfolio maturities  maturing assets and maturing liabilities 
our asset liability management committee is responsible for establishing procedures that enable us to achieve our goals while adhering to prudent banking practices and existing loan and investment policies 
we have focused on maintaining balance between interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities and repricing frequencies 
an important element of this focus has been to emphasize variable rate loans and investments funded by deposits that also mature or reprice over periods of months or less 
the following table presents  at december   loans by maturity in each major category of our portfolio 
actual maturities may differ from the contractual maturities shown below as a result of renewals and prepayments 
loan renewals are evaluated in the same manner as new credit applications 
at december  less than one to over in thousands one year five years five years total commercial real estate mortgage land acquisition development real estate construction consumer other total loans of the million of loans with maturities of one year or more  approximately million were fixed rate loans and million were variable rate loans at december  to augment our asset and liability management strategy  we also began using interest rate swaps on our loan portfolio in  with the overall goal of minimizing the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our net interest margin 
interest rate swaps involve the exchange of fixed rate and variable rate interest payment obligations without the exchange of the underlying notional amounts 
since we implemented the program in  we have entered into different interest rate swap agreements  of which were outstanding at december  under the interest rate swap agreements  we receive a fixed rate and pay a variable rate based on the prime rate 
the swaps qualify as cash flow hedges under asc topic  derivatives and hedging asc  and are designated as hedges of the variability of cash flows we receive from certain of our prime indexed loans 
in accordance with asc  these swap agreements are measured at fair value and reported as assets or liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition 
the portion of the change in the fair value of the swaps that is deemed effective in hedging the cash flows of the designated assets are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax effects oci and reclassified into interest income when such cash flows occur in the future 
any ineffectiveness resulting from the hedges is recorded as a gain or loss in the consolidated statements of operations as a part of noninterest income

in february  the company initiated a new series of interest rate swap transactions designated as cash flow hedges 
the intent of the transactions are to fix the effective interest rate of payments due on its junior subordinated debentures with the objective of reducing the company s exposure to adverse changes in cash flows relating to payments on its libor based floating rate debt 
the swap agreements having a total notional value of million will fix the interest rates between and and mature over varying lengths of time from five and years 
these interest rate swaps were effective for cash settlements beginning in february and net interest income was decreased million during the year ended december   from the settlement of payments on the swaps
