item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general management overview the company was greatly impacted by the recessionary pressures that began in the latter half of fiscal and have continued into fiscal  including a significant decline in consumer spending 
as consumer spending and confidence could remain depressed  the company has focused on carefully managing those factors within its control  most importantly spending  including reducing its fiscal and fiscal capital expenditures  and improved inventory productivity to maximize inventory turns for both wholesale and retail operations 
the company will continue its efforts to improve its retail operations and in store experience to maximize retail revenues  reduce its cost base and minimize discretionary spending  optimize inventory levels and improve working capital and operating cash flows 
the company s net sales decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  due to decreases in both retail and wholesale sales 
retail sales decreased compared to the prior year as a result of decreases in sales for both perfumania and sow which were due to the impact of store level promotions and the termination of certain consignment arrangements 
wholesale revenues decreased by from the prior year due primarily to less discounting during fiscal compared with the prior year 
our operating expenses decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal in fiscal  we recorded a million claim for refund of federal income taxes as we were able to carry back a portion of our net operating loss to the previously filed federal tax return of model reorg  inc model reorg  a predecessor company 
including million of interest expense  we realized a net loss of approximately million in fiscal  compared with a net loss of million in fiscal 
table of contents the following table sets forth selected items from our consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of total net sales for the periods indicated percentage of net sales fiscal year ended fiscal year ended january  january  total net sales total gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses asset impairment depreciation and amortization total operating expenses income from operations interest expense loss before income taxes income tax benefit net loss critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
preparation of these statements requires management to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  asset impairments  sales returns and allowances  and other contingent assets and liabilities 
as such  some accounting policies have a significant impact on amounts reported in these financial statements 
the judgments and estimates made can significantly affect results 
materially different amounts might be reported under different conditions or by using different assumptions 
we consider an accounting policy to be critical if it is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and requires significant judgment and estimates by management in its application 
we have identified certain critical accounting policies that affect the significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements 
accounts receivable  net of allowances in the normal course of business  we extend credit to wholesale customers that satisfy pre determined credit criteria 
accounts receivable  net of allowances  as shown on the consolidated balance sheets  is net of allowances for doubtful accounts 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through the analysis of the aging of accounts receivable at the date of the financial statements  assessments of collectability based on an evaluation of historical and anticipated trends  the financial condition of our customers and an evaluation of the impact of economic conditions 
should circumstances change or economic conditions deteriorate significantly  we may need to increase our provisions 
inventory adjustments and writeoffs inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost being determined on a weighted average cost basis 
we review our inventory on a regular basis for excess and potentially slow moving inventory based on prior sales  forecasted demand  historical experience and through specific identification of obsolete or damaged merchandise and we record adjustments to reduce the carrying value of inventory to the lower of cost or market in accordance with our assessment 
if actual sales are less than our forecasts  additional writeoffs could be necessary 
inventory shrinkage is estimated and accrued between physical inventory counts 
significant differences between future experience and that which was projected for either the shrinkage or inventory reserves could affect the recorded amounts of inventory and cost of sales 
impairment of long lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of long lived assets may be impaired  an evaluation of recoverability is performed by comparing the carrying value of the assets to projected future undiscounted cash flows in 
table of contents addition to other quantitative and qualitative analyses 
inherent in this process is significant management judgment as to the projected cash flows 
upon indication that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable  the company recognizes an impairment loss as a charge against current operations 
property and equipment assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows when assessing impairment 
cash flows for retail assets are identified at the individual store level 
factors that could trigger an impairment review include a significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  or a significant negative industry or economic trend 
judgments are also made as to whether under performing stores should be closed 
even if a decision has been made not to close an under performing store  the assets at that store may be impaired 
due in part to the deteriorating united states economy and resulting decline in retail sales  the company conducted an internal review of its long lived assets primarily leasehold improvements at the store level in fiscal and determined that the carrying value of certain assets exceeded their projected future undiscounted cash flows 
the company then determined the fair value of the identified long lived assets by discounting their projected future cash flows using a rate approximating the company s weighted average cost of capital  which resulted in an impairment charge of approximately million 
the company conducted a similar review of its long lived assets at the store level in fiscal and recorded an impairment charge of approximately million 
in fiscal  we also recorded an impairment charge of approximately million on a building under a capital lease 
as the projection of future cash flows requires the use of judgments and estimates  if actual results are materially different than these judgments or estimates  additional charges could be necessary 
significant deterioration in the performance of the company s stores compared to projections could result in significant additional asset impairments 
impairment of intangible assets the company s owned tradenames that have been determined to have indefinite lives are not subject to amortization but are reviewed at least annually for potential impairment 
the fair values are estimated and compared to their carrying values 
fair value is principally estimated using a discounted cash flow model which depends on  among other factors  estimates of future sales and expense trends  liquidity and capitalization 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable  but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
we recognize an impairment loss when the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value 
trademarks  including tradenames and owned licenses having finite lives are amortized over their respective lives to their estimated residual values and are also reviewed for impairment 
the recoverability of the carrying values of all long lived assets with finite lives is re evaluated when changes in circumstances indicate the assets value may be impaired 
there was no recorded goodwill as of january  and january  based on management s impairment review at january  and january   there was no impairment of trademarks or tradenames in fiscal or we will continue to monitor the expected future cash flows of the company s reporting units and the long term market capitalization trends to assess the carrying values of the intangible assets 
sales and allowances revenue from wholesale transactions is recorded when title passes 
wholesale revenue is recorded net of returns  discounts and allowances 
revenue from retail sales is recorded  net of discounts  at the point of sale for perfumania stores  and for consignment sales  when sale to the ultimate customer occurs 
revenue from internet sales is recognized at the time products are delivered to customers 
we record an estimate of returns  discounts and allowances  and review and refine these estimates on a regular basis based on current experience and trends 
our historical estimates of these costs have not differed materially from actual results  however  if the actual rate of sales returns increases significantly  our operating results could be adversely affected 
valuation of deferred tax assets accounting guidance requires that deferred tax assets be evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe it is more likely than not that a portion of these assets will not be realized 
the guidance also prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition  presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return and also provides guidance on various related matters such as derecognition  interest and penalties  and disclosure 
we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets including our recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction  expectations of future taxable income  the carry forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes and other relevant factors 
the range of possible judgments relating to the valuation of our deferred tax assets is very wide 
significant judgment is required in making these assessments and it is very difficult to predict when  if ever  our assessment may conclude that the remaining portion of our deferred tax assets is realizable 
significant differences between future experience and that which was projected in calculating deferred tax assets could result in significant additional adjustments to our deferred tax assets and income tax expense

we exclude stores that are closed for renovation from comparable store sales from the month during which renovation commences until the first full month after reopening 
the average retail price per unit sold during fiscal increased from fiscal while the total number of units sold decreased by 
the increase in the average retail price per unit sold and the decrease in the number of units sold were due to various store level promotions 
sow s consignment sales decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease in sow s net sales is due to a decrease in sales to existing customers as well as the termination of several consignment arrangements during fiscal the decrease in wholesale sales of million is the result of less discounting during fiscal compared with the prior year  as in fiscal management focused on reducing inventory levels and offered more promotional pricing resulting in higher sales

at the end of both fiscal and fiscal  we conducted an internal review of the company s long lived assets and determined that the carrying value of certain assets exceeded their future undiscounted cash flows 
we then determined the fair value of the identified long lived assets by discounting their future cash flows using a rate approximating the company s weighted average cost of capital  which resulted in impairment charges of approximately million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
we also recorded an impairment charge of approximately million relating to a capital lease on a building during fiscal year depreciation and amortization was approximately million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal as a result of the foregoing  we recognized income from operations in fiscal of approximately million compared to income from operations in fiscal of million 
other expenses for the year ended in thousands january  january  percentage decrease interest expense interest expense was approximately million for fiscal compared with approximately million in fiscal the decrease in interest expense is due primarily to a lower average outstanding balance and a lower overall average interest rate on the company s revolving credit facility during fiscal compared with fiscal  offset by an increase in the amortization of deferred finance costs in fiscal compared with fiscal overall  the interest rates on total variable interest debt decreased by approximately during fiscal as compared to fiscal 
table of contents income tax provision for the year ended in thousands january  january  percentage decrease income tax benefit provision our effective tax rate for fiscal was a benefit of while the rate for fiscal was 
in fiscal  the effective tax rate differed from our federal statutory rate primarily because the company was able to carryback a portion of its net operating loss to model reorg s previously filed federal tax return  resulting in a claim for refund of federal income taxes of approximately million 
in fiscal  the effective tax rates differed from our federal statutory rates primarily due to the impact of recording the valuation allowances described below and non deductible expenses 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
we recognize valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the likelihood of realization  we consider past taxable income  estimates of future taxable income and tax planning strategies 
we performed a comprehensive review of the likely realization of these assets at january   considering the then current broad economic environment and the challenges facing retailers for the foreseeable future 
at january  we concluded that it was necessary to record a valuation allowance of million  which was reflected as a non cash charge in the tax provision for fiscal the company continues to provide a full valuation allowance on all deferred tax assets 
net loss as a result of the foregoing  we realized a net loss of approximately million in fiscal  compared to a net loss of million in fiscal liquidity and capital resources our principal funding requirements are for inventory purchases  financing extended terms on accounts receivable  paying down accounts payable and debt  information systems enhancements  opening new stores and renovation of existing stores 
these capital requirements generally have been satisfied through borrowings under the respective revolving credit facilities and notes payable to affiliates 
on january   the company entered into a new million revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks the senior credit facility 
the initial proceeds of the senior credit facility were used to pay amounts incurred in connection with the company s previous senior credit facility  which was terminated 
the senior credit facility is used for the company s general corporate purposes and those of its subsidiaries  including working capital 
the company and certain of its subsidiaries are co borrowers under the senior credit facility  and certain of the company s other subsidiaries have guaranteed all of their obligations thereunder 
the senior credit facility is scheduled to expire on january   when all amounts will be due and payable in full 
the senior credit facility does not require amortization of principal and may be paid before maturity in whole or in part at the company s option without penalty or premium 
revolving loans under the senior credit facility may be drawn  repaid and reborrowed up to the amount available under a borrowing base calculated with reference to a specified percentage of the borrowers eligible credit card receivables  a specified percentage of the borrowers eligible trade receivables and a specified percentage of the borrowers eligible inventory from time to time  which may be reduced by the lender in its reasonable discretion 
the senior credit facility also includes a sub limit of million for letters of credit and a sub limit of million for swing line loans that is  same day loans from the lead or agent bank 
interest under the senior credit facility is  at the company s election unless an event of default exists  at either i the highest of a base rate  as defined in the agreement or ii the libor rate  plus in each case  specified margins that are determined based upon the company s excess availability as calculated under the facility from time to time 
interest rate margins for the first six 
table of contents months are set at per annum for libor rate borrowings and for base rate borrowings and may range between higher and lower thereafter 
the company is also required to pay monthly commitment fees ranging from 
to 
per annum of the unused amount of the senior credit facility  depending on the average outstanding balance  and a monthly fee ranging from to per annum of the outstanding amount of letters of credit based upon its excess availability 
all obligations of the company under the senior credit facility and under any interest rate protection or other hedging arrangements entered into in connection with the senior credit facility are secured by first priority perfected security interests in all existing and after acquired personal property and owned real property owned by the company and its subsidiaries  which are co borrowers or guarantors  including  without limitation  or  in the case of excluded foreign subsidiaries  of the outstanding equity interests in their subsidiaries 
the senior credit facility imposes customary limitations on the company s ability to  among other things incur additional indebtedness  incur liens or guarantee obligations  pay dividends and make other distributions  make investments and enter into joint ventures  dispose of assets  and engage in transactions with affiliates  except for certain existing arrangements under which the company leases space and obtains certain business services from affiliated companies and other arrangements in the ordinary course of business and on an arms length basis 
the senior credit facility also provides that advances to suppliers by the company and its subsidiaries for five days or less may not exceed million with respect to all suppliers or million with respect to any one supplier together with its affiliates and other advances to suppliers may not exceed million with respect to all suppliers or million with respect to any one supplier together with its affiliates 
in addition  under the senior credit facility  the company and its subsidiaries must maintain availability under the facility of at least the greater of of the aggregate amount that may be advanced against eligible credit card receivables  trade receivables and inventory or million 
as of january   the company had million available to borrow under the senior credit facility based on the borrowing base at that date 
any failure to comply with the financial or operating covenants of the senior credit facility or the occurrence of other customary events of default  including a change in control of the company  would not only prevent the company and its subsidiaries from being able to borrow additional funds  but would constitute a default  resulting in  among other things  the amounts outstanding  including all accrued interest and unpaid fees  becoming immediately due and payable 
the company was in compliance with all financial and operating covenants as of january  as a condition of entering into the senior credit facility  effective january   one of the company s subsidiaries executed amended and restated subordinated promissory notes amending certain outstanding unsecured subordinated debt obligations 
the unsecured debt obligations that are subordinated to the senior credit facility are as follows i a promissory note in the principal amount of million  held by quality king the qkd note  which provides for payment of principal in quarterly installments between april  and july  and payment of interest in quarterly installments commencing on january  at the then current senior debt rate  as defined in the senior credit facility  plus per annum  ii promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of approximately million  held by six estate trusts established by glenn  stephen and arlene nussdorf the nussdorf trust notes  which provide for payment of the principal in full on april  and payments of interest in quarterly installments commencing on january  at the then current senior debt rate plus per annum  and iii a convertible note in the principal amount of million held by glenn and stephen nussdorf the convertible note  which allows the holders to convert any or all of the principal and accrued interest into shares of the company s common stock at per share 
this note provides for payment in january and is currently in default because of the restrictions on payment described below  resulting in an increase of in the nominal interest rate  which is the prime rate plus 
under the senior credit facility  no principal may be paid on any of the qkd note  the nussdorf trust notes or the convertible note until three months after the senior credit facility terminates and is paid in full  and payment of interest is subject to satisfaction of certain conditions  including the company s maintaining excess availability under the senior credit facility of million or of commitment and a fixed charge coverage ratio  as defined in the credit agreement  of net cash used in operating activities during fiscal was approximately million  compared with approximately million provided by operating activities during fiscal accounts receivable decreased in fiscal due to the decrease in sales to our wholesale customers 
inventories increased due to management s efforts to reduce overall retail store and distribution center inventory levels in the prior year 
the decrease in accounts payable to both affiliates and non affiliates is due to the timing of payments to our vendors in fiscal 
table of contents our purchases from related parties described in detail in note to our consolidated financial statements are generally payable in days  however due to the seasonality of our business these terms are generally extended 
related party accounts have historically been brought closer to terms at the end of the holiday season 
during the rest of the year  the company has relied upon these extended terms to provide a portion of its liquidity 
net cash used in investing activities was approximately million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal fiscal investing activities primarily involved spending for renovation of existing stores  and opening three new perfumania stores and six seasonal locations  as well as information technology enhancements 
during fiscal  we purchased three existing retail stores from an unrelated party for million 
at january   perfumania operated stores 
we plan to open approximately two stores in fiscal and plan to close approximately stores 
we anticipate we will spend approximately million in fiscal on capital expenditures  which will be used for perfumania new store construction and remodels  and information technology enhancements 
we continuously evaluate the appropriate new store growth rate in light of economic conditions and may adjust the growth rate as conditions change 
net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal was approximately million  compared with net cash used in financing activities of approximately million in fiscal the fiscal increase in cash provided by financing activities reflects an increase in the balance of the bank line of credit due to the timing of payments to our accounts payable vendors 
a summary of our cash flows for fiscal and fiscal is as follows in thousands fiscal year ended fiscal year ended january  january  summary cash flow information cash used in provided by operating activities cash used in investing activities cash provided by used in financing activities decrease in cash cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year cash and cash equivalents at end of year based on past performance and current expectations  we believe that our cash balances and the available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility  our affiliated borrowings and our projected future operating results will generate sufficient liquidity to support the company s working capital needs  capital expenditures and debt service in the short and long term 
however  as discussed above  the amount of availability under the senior credit facility depends on our eligible receivables and inventory at any given time  and may be further reduced by our bankers  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our bankers also would have the right to terminate our senior credit facility if we default on our covenants  which would require us to seek alternative financing in a highly unfavorable credit environment 
furthermore  the state of the national economy may worsen  which would further restrict customers ability to purchase fragrance products 
any of these circumstances  as well as any of the matters discussed in risk factors above  could have a materially adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition  so there can be no assurance that management s plans and expectations will be successful 
significant contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company s significant contractual obligations at january  certain of these contractual obligations are reflected in our consolidated balance sheet at january   while others are disclosed as future obligations
