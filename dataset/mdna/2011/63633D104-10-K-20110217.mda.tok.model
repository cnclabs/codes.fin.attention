executive overview nhi  a maryland corporation incorporated in  is a reit which invests in income producing health care properties primarily in the long term care and senior housing industries 
as of december   our portfolio consisted of real estate excluding corporate office and assets held for sale and mortgage investments with a carrying value totaling  and other investments in preferred stock and marketable securities of  resulting in total invested assets of  we are a self managed reit  with our own management reporting directly to our board of directors 
our mission is to invest in health care real estate which generates current income that will be distributed to stockholders 
we have pursued this mission by investing in leased properties and mortgage loans nationwide  primarily in the long term health care and senior housing industries 
portfolio at december   our continuing operations consisted of investments in real estate and mortgage notes receivable in health care facilities located in states consisting of skilled nursing facilities  assisted living facilities  medical office buildings  independent living facilities  acute psychiatric hospital  acute care hospital and transitional rehabilitation center 
these investments consisted of approximately  of net real estate investments in health care facilities with lessees and  aggregate carrying value of mortgage notes receivable from borrowers related to health care facilities 
major customer nhc we lease health care facilities to national healthcare corporation nhc  a publicly held company and our largest customer 
these facilities include centers subleased to and operated by other companies  the lease payments of which are guaranteed to us by nhc 
our rental income from continuing operations in was   or from nhc  in was   or from nhc  and in was   or from nhc 
consistent with our strategy of diversification  we have increased our portfolio so that the portion of our real estate portfolio leased by nhc has been reduced from of our total portfolio on october  the date we began operations to of our total real estate portfolio on december   based on the net book value carrying amount of these properties of  in  these assets were tran sferred by nhc to us at net book value in a non taxable exchange 
many of these assets were substantially depreciated as a result of having been carried on nhc books for as many as years 
as a result  we believe the current fair market value of these assets is significantly in excess of their net book value 
subsequent additions to our portfolio related to non nhc facilities reflect their higher book value based on at the cost of the properties on the date the investment was made 
as with all assets in our portfolio  we monitor the financial and operating results of each of the nhc properties on a quarterly basis 
in addition to reviewing the consolidated financial results of nhc  the individual center financial results are reviewed including their occupancy  patient mix  state survey results and other relevant information

we invest a portion of our funds in the preferred and common shares of other publicly held reits to ensure the substantial portion of our assets are invested for real estate purposes 
at december   our investments in preferred and common shares of publicly held reits were  and our investments in other available for sale marketable securities were  refer to notes  and of our consolidated financial statements for further information 
areas of focus we are evaluating and will potentially make new investments in while continuing to monitor and improve our existing properties 
we continue to selectively evaluate new portfolio investments and monitor the current prices being offered for health care assets 
however  even as we make new investments  we expect to maintain a relatively low level of debt compared to our total book capitalization 
new investments in real estate and mortgage notes may be funded by our liquid investments and by external financing 
we intend to make new investments that meet our underwriting criteria and where we believe the spreads over our cost of capital will generate sufficient returns to our shareholders 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates and cause our reported net income to vary significantly from period to period 
if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements  the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations  liquidity and or financial condition 
we consider an accounting estimate or assumption critical if the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change  and the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material 
our significant accounting policies and the associated estimates  judgments and the issues which impact these estimates are as follows valuations and impairments to our investments the majority of our tenants and borrowers are in the long term health care industry and derive their revenues primarily from medicare  medicaid and other government programs 
amounts paid under these government programs are subject to legislative and government budget constraints 
from time to time  there may be material changes in government reimbursement 
in the past  the long term health care industry has at times experienced material reductions in government reimbursement 
the long term health care industry has also experienced a dramatic increase in professional liability claims and in the cost of insurance to cover such claims 
these factors combined to cause a number of bankruptcy filings  bankruptcy court rulings and court judgments affecting our lessees and borrowers 
in prior years  we had determined that impairment of certain of our investments had occurred as a result of these events 
we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying values of our properties on a property by property basis 
on a quarterly basis  we review our properties for recoverability when events or circumstances  including significant physical changes in the property  significant adverse changes in general economic conditions and significant deteriorations of the underlying cash flows of the property  indicate that the carrying amount of the property may not be recoverable 
the need to recognize an impairment charge is based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows from a property compared to the carrying value of that property 
if recognition of an impairment charge is necessary  it is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the property exceeds the fair value of the property 

table of contents for notes receivable  impairment recognition is based upon an evaluation of the estimated collectability of loan payments and general economic conditions on a specific loan basis 
on a quarterly basis  we review our notes receivable for ability to realize on such notes when events or circumstances  including the non receipt of principal and interest payments  significant deteriorations of the financial condition of the borrower and significant adverse changes in general economic conditions  indicate that the carrying amount of the note receivable may not be recoverable 
if necessary  impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the discounted cash flows expected to be received under the note receivable or  if foreclosure is probable  the fair value of the collateral securing the note receivable 
we evaluate our marketable equity securities for other than temporary impairments 
an impairment of a marketable equity security would be considered other than temporary unless we have the ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient for a forecasted market price recovery up to or beyond the cost of the investment and evidence indicates the cost of the investment is recoverable within a reasonable period of time 
while we believe that the carrying amounts of our properties are recoverable and our notes receivable  marketable securities and other investments are realizable  it is possible that future events could require us to make significant adjustments or revisions to these estimates 
revenue recognition mortgage interest and rental income we collect interest and rent from our customers 
generally  our policy is to recognize revenues on an accrual basis as earned 
however  there are certain of our customers  for whom we have determined  based on insufficient historical collections and the lack of expected future collections  that revenue for interest or rent is not probable of collection until received 
for these investments  our policy is to recognize interest or rental income when assured  which we consider to be the period the amounts are collected 
we identify investments as nonperforming if a required payment is not received within days of the date it is due 
this policy could cause our revenues to vary significantly from period to period 
revenue from minimum lease payments under our leases is recognized on a straight line basis to the extent that futu re lease payments are considered collectible 
lease payments that depend on a factor directly related to future use of the property  such as an increase in annual revenues over a base year revenues  are considered to be contingent rentals  are included in rental income when they are determinable and earned  and are excluded from future minimum lease payments 
reit status and taxes we believe that we have operated our business so as to qualify as a reit under sections through of the code and we intend to continue to operate in such a manner  but no assurance can be given that we will be able to qualify at all times 
if we qualify as a reit  we will generally not be subject to federal corporate income taxes on our net income that is currently distributed to our stockholders 
this treatment substantially eliminates the double taxation at the corporate and stockholder levels that typically applies to corporate dividends 
our failure to continue to qualify under the applicable reit qualification rules and regulations would cause us to owe state and federal income taxes and would have a material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
real estate and mortgage notes receivable write downs and recoveries our borrowers and tenants experience periods of significant financial pressures and difficulties similar to other health care providers 
governments at both the federal and state levels have enacted legislation to lower or at least slow the growth in payments to health care providers 
furthermore  the costs of professional liability insurance have increased significantly during this same period 
since the inception of our company  a number of our facility operators and mortgage loan borrowers have experienced bankruptcy 
others have been forced to surrender properties to us in lieu of foreclosure or for certain periods failed to make timely payments on their obligations to us 
the following table summarizes our write downs and recoveries for the last three years for both continuing and discontinued operations write downs recoveries years ended december  in thousands real estate mortgages notes receivable 
table of contents during  we received payments totaling  as a recovery of previous mortgage note write downs 
the payments resulted from the settlement of bankruptcy proceedings related to a former borrower to whom we had originally provided mortgage note financing on five skilled nursing facilities in georgia 
in february  we received payment in full of  on the pro rata portion of a note secured by a georgia skilled nursing facility and recorded a recovery of amounts previously written down of during  we recorded an impairment charge of  related to two kansas facilities to reduce the carrying value of these facilities to fair value less the cost of selling the facilities 
one of the facilities  located in hoisington  kansas  was sold in november the remaining facility  located in emporia  kansas  was sold during the first quarter of prior to selling the emporia facility  an additional impairment charge of  was recorded to further reduce its carrying value 
we believe that the carrying amounts of our real estate properties are recoverable and our mortgage notes receivable are realizable and supported by the value of the underlying collateral 
however  it is possible that future events could require us to make significant adjustments to these carrying amounts 
security writedowns and recoveries at december   we concluded there were no other than temporary impairments of our marketable securities 
enhanced cash funds on december   we were notified by bank of america that its largest  privately placed  enhanced cash fund called columbia strategic cash fund the fund would be closed and liquidated 
in addition  cash redemptions were temporarily suspended  although redemptions could be filled through a pro rata distribution of the underlying securities  consisting principally of corporate debt  mortgage backed securities and asset backed securities  the fund s valuation would be based on the market value of the underlying securities  whereas historically the fund s valuation was based on amortized cost  and interest would continue to accrue 
the carrying value of our investment in the fund on december  was  subsequent to december  and prior to december   we received a pro rata distribution of underlying securities in the fund as described above of  to a separate investment management account ima and cash redemptions of principal totaling  realized losses on the distribution and redemption of securities and cash amounted to  for a decline in the market value of any available for sale security below cost that is deemed to be other than temporary results in an impairment to reduce the carrying amount to fair value 
the impairment is charged to operations and a new cost basis for the security is established 
to determine whether an impairment is other than temporary  we consider whether we have the ability and intent to hold the investment until a market price recovery and consider whether evidence indicating the cost of the investment is recoverable outweighs evidence to the contrary 
evidence considered in this assessment includes the reasons for the impairment  the severity and duration of the impairment  changes in value subsequent to a reporting date and forecasted performance of the investment 
in  we concluded there was an other than temporary impairment of the fund and the ima totaling  which we charged to operations 
exclusive of the other than temporary impairment charge  realized losses for the year ended december  amounted to  which were charged to operations 
during  we received cash distributions from the fund and ima totaling  for the year ended december   we received cash redemptions of principal from the fund and ima totaling  net realized gains for the same period were  and were recognized in non operating income 
as of december   both the fund and the ima were fully liquidated 
during the fourth quarter of  we sold  common shares of ltc properties  inc for an average price of per share 
as a result  we recorded  as a gain on the sale   of which was a recovery of a previously recorded other than temporary impairment

table of contents our monthly cash flows are generated from our core business investments in mortgage loans and real estate leases 
we routinely use our available cash to reduce our revolving credit facility balance  thereby minimizing our interest expense on borrowed funds 
on february   we entered into a  unsecured revolving credit facility to fund new healthcare real estate investments 
the credit facility  which was provided by regions bank as agent and pinnacle national bank as a participating bank  bore interest at a margin of basis points over libor with a floor of and was scheduled to mature in february the unused balance fee was per annum 
on november   we terminated this credit facility and entered into a new  unsecured credit facility with regions bank as agent and pinnacle national bank as a participating bank 
a total of  can be drawn on a revolving basis with a maturity of three years november  with interest at a margin of basis points over libor at december  
there is an accordion feature in the credit facility that could increase the total credit facility to  the credit facility contains financial covenants related to our leverage ratio  fixed charge ratio  unencumbered asset ratio and tangible net worth ratio  all of which we were in compliance with at december  the credit facility had an outstanding balance of  at december   with an available unused balance of  for the year ended december   we recognized  in interest expense related to these credit facilities 
subsequent to december   a total of  was drawn on january  on a term loan  whose proceeds were used to repay the revolving line  to mature in five years with interest at a fixed rate of based on an interest rate swap agreement 
the interest rate swap agreement was entered into to limit the company s interest rate risk exposure related to the term loan 
we intend to comply with reit dividend requirements that we distribute at least of our taxable income for the year ending december  and thereafter 
it has been our practice to distribute of our taxable income in the form of dividends to stockholders 
we declared total annual dividends of per common share to stockholders of record in  to stockholders of record in  and to stockholders of record in dividends declared for the fourth quarter of each fiscal year are paid by the end of the following january and are treated for tax purposes as having been paid in the fiscal year just ended as provided in irs code sec

effective november   the revolving credit facility maturity was extended for three years commitments at december   we had pending commitments related to three health care real estate projects as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  in june  we entered into a construction loan commitment to provide up to  to sant mesa  llc for the development and construction of a bed transitional rehabilitation center in mesa  arizona  and as of december  we had funded a total of  toward this commitment  one of our leases contains a provision whereby we will fund up to  of certain capital improvements and operating equipment purchases 
table of contents with the total being added to the base amount from which the lease payment is calculated  and we were committed to fund an additional  on a mortgage note receivable 
we believe we have sufficient liquidity to fund these commitments and to finance new investments 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  we have agreed to sell six skilled nursing facilities to our current lessee  affiliates of fundamental long term care holdings  llc 
we are committed to finance a portion of the purchase price  not to exceed  with individual loans for each facility to be repaid over a term of five years with interest of per annum plus annual fixed escalators 
contingencies in october  we completed a purchase leaseback transaction with bickford senior living and its affiliates bickford for  the purchase price includes  in conditional payments to be made over a three year period based on bickford s expected achievement of certain operating financial thresholds 
in march  we completed a purchase leaseback transaction with helix healthcare helix for  the purchase price includes  as a conditional payment which is expected to be made in funds from operations and normalized funds from operations our funds from operations ffo were  for the year ended december   versus  in  an increase of 
the increase in ffo was primarily the result of new leases that commenced during the year 
ffo represents net earnings available to common stockholders  excluding the effects of asset dispositions  plus depreciation associated with real estate investments 
we believe that ffo is an important supplemental measure of operating performance for a reit 
because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight line depreciation except on land  such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen and fallen with market conditions  presentation of operating results for a reit that uses historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative and should be supplemented with a measure such as ffo 
the term ffo was designed by the reit industry to address this issue 
our measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other reits 
consequently  our ffo may not provide a meaningful measure of our performance as compared to that of other reits 
since other reits may not use ou r definition of ffo  caution should be exercised when comparing our ffo to that of other reits 
ffo in and of itself does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap ffo does not include changes in operating assets and liabilities and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net earnings as an indication of operating performance  or to net cash flow from operating activities as determined by gaap in the united states as a measure of liquidity and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 
normalized ffo excludes from ffo certain adjustments that may include  but are not limited to  impairment of assets  gains and losses attributable to the acquisition and disposition of assets and liabilities  and recoveries of previous write downs 
we have complied with the sec s interpretation that impairments taken on real property may not be added back to net income in the calculation of ffo 
the sec s position is that impairments on real property are not non recurring and are not an appropriate adjustment 
the results of operations for facilities included in assets held for sale or facilities sold have been reported in the current and prior periods as discontinued operations 
the reclassifications to retrospectively reflect the disposition of these facilities had no impact on previously reported ffo

our revenues are generated primarily from long term investments in health care real estate and mortgage loans 
our lessees and borrowers are operators of health care facilities which are directly impacted by inflation in employee related costs and other facility expenses 
inflation has remained relatively low during recent periods 
there can be no assurance that future medicare  medicaid or private pay rate increases will be sufficient to offset future inflation increases 
certain of our leases require annual escalators in lease rates based upon increases in the revenues of the tenants 
new accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of new accounting standards 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less 
most of our mortgage and other notes receivable bear interest at fixed interest rates 
our investment in preferred stock represents an investment in the preferred stock of another reit and yields dividends at a fixed rate of 
as a result of the short term nature of our cash instruments and because the interest rates on our investments in notes receivable and preferred stock are fixed  a hypothetical change in interest rates has no impact on our future earnings and cash flows related to these instruments 
on november   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to fix the interest rate on a  term loan at for five years 
on january   we received proceeds from the term loan and paid off our revolving credit facility in full 
we currently have  available to draw on our revolving credit facility at a floating interest rate of basis points over libor 
equity price risk we consider our investments in marketable securities of  at december  as available for sale securities 
increases and decreases in the fair market value of our investments in other marketable securities are unrealized gains and losses that are recorded in stockholders equity 
the investments in marketable securities are recorded at their fair market value based on quoted market prices 
thus  there is exposure to equity price risk  which is the potential change in fair value due to a change in quoted market prices 
we monitor our investments in marketable securities to consider evidence of whether any portion of our original investment is likely not to be recoverable  at which time we would record an impairment charge to operations 
a hypothetical change in quoted market prices would result in a related  change in the fair value of our investments in marketable securities
