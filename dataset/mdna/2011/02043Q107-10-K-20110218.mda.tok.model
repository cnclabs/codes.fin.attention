item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics based on rnai 
rnai is a naturally occurring biological pathway within cells for selectively silencing and regulating the expression of specific genes 
since many diseases are caused by the inappropriate activity of specific genes  the ability to silence genes selectively through rnai could provide a new way to treat a wide range of human diseases 
we believe that drugs that work through rnai have the potential to become a broad new class of drugs  like small molecule  protein and antibody drugs 
using our intellectual property and the expertise we have built in rnai  we are developing a set of biological and chemical methods and know how that we apply in a systematic way to develop rnai therapeutics for a variety of diseases 
our core product strategy  which we refer to as alnylam x  is focused on the development and commercialization of innovative rnai therapeutics for the treatment of genetically defined diseases 
under our core product strategy  we expect to progress five rnai therapeutic programs into advanced stages of clinical development by the end of as part of this strategy  our goal is to develop product candidates with the following shared characteristics a genetically defined target and disease  the potential to have a significant impact in high unmet need patient populations  the ability to leverage our existing rnai delivery platform  the opportunity to monitor an early biomarker in phase i clinical trials for human proof of concept  and the existence of clinically relevant endpoints for the filing of an nda  with a focused patient database and possible accelerated paths for commercialization 
we intend to commercialize products arising from this core product strategy on our own in the united states and potentially certain other countries  and we intend to enter into alliances to develop and commercialize any such products in other global territories 
we are currently advancing three core programs in clinical or pre clinical development aln ttr for the treatment of attr  aln pcs for the treatment of severe hypercholesterolemia  and aln hpn for the treatment of refractory anemia 
as part of our core product strategy  we also expect to designate and start pre clinical development of two additional rnai therapeutic candidates targeting genetically defined diseases by the end of while focusing our efforts on our core product strategy  we also intend to continue to advance additional development programs through existing or future alliances 
we have three partner based programs in clinical or pre clinical development  including aln rsv for the treatment of rsv  aln vsp for the treatment of liver cancers and aln htt for the treatment of hd 
we also continue to work internally and with third party collaborators to develop new technologies to deliver our rnai therapeutics both directly to specific sites of disease  and systemically by intravenous or subcutaneous administration 
we have numerous rnai therapeutic delivery collaborations and intend to continue to collaborate with government  academic and corporate third parties to evaluate different delivery options 
in addition  our expertise in rnai therapeutics and broad intellectual property estate have allowed us to form alliances with leading companies  including isis  medtronic  novartis  biogen idec  roche  takeda  kyowa hakko kirin and cubist 
we have also entered into contracts with government agencies  including the niaid  a component of the nih 
we have established collaborations with and  in some instances  received funding from major medical and disease associations  including chdi 
finally  to further enable the field and monetize our intellectual property rights  we also grant licenses to biotechnology companies for the development and commercialization of rnai therapeutics for specified targets in which we have no direct strategic interest under our interferx program  and to research companies that commercialize rnai reagents or services under our research product licenses 
in september  as a result of the planned completion of the fifth and final year of the research program under our collaboration and license agreement with novartis and our reduced need for service based collaboration resources  we undertook a corporate restructuring to focus our resources on our most promising programs and significantly reduce our cost structure 
the corporate restructuring included a reduction of our overall workforce by approximately 
we expect this reduction in personnel costs  along with other external costs  could result in a savings of approximately million in previously planned operating expenses 
during the year ended december   we recorded million in operating expenses under the restructuring  including employee 
table of contents severance  benefits and related costs 
we expect to have paid substantially all of these expenses by the end of the first half of alnylam commenced operations in june we have focused our efforts since inception primarily on business planning  research and development  acquiring  filing and expanding intellectual property rights  recruiting management and technical staff  and raising capital 
since our inception  we have generated significant losses 
at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
through december   we have funded our operations primarily through the net proceeds from the sale of equity securities  as well as payments we have received under strategic alliances 
through december   a substantial portion of our total net revenues have been collaboration revenues derived from our strategic alliances with roche  takeda and novartis  and from the united states government in connection with our development of treatments for hemorrhagic fever viruses  including ebola 
we expect our revenues to continue to be derived primarily from new and existing strategic alliances  government and foundation funding  and license fee revenues 
we currently have programs focused in a number of therapeutic areas 
however  we are unable to predict when  if ever  we will successfully develop or be able to commence sales of any product 
we have never achieved profitability on an annual basis and we expect to incur additional losses over the next several years 
we expect our net losses to continue due primarily to research and development activities relating to our drug development programs  collaborations and other general corporate activities 
we anticipate that our operating results will fluctuate for the foreseeable future 
therefore  period to period comparisons should not be relied upon as predictive of the results in future periods 
our sources of potential funding for the next several years are expected to be derived primarily from payments under new and existing strategic alliances  which may include license and other fees  funded research and development payments and milestone payments  government and foundation funding  and proceeds from the sale of equity or debt 
research and development since our inception  we have focused on drug discovery and development programs 
research and development expenses represent a substantial percentage of our total operating expenses 
under our core product strategy  we expect to progress five rnai therapeutic programs into advanced stages of clinical development by the end of while focusing our efforts on our core product strategy  we also intend to continue to advance additional partner based development programs through existing or future alliances 
in addition  we continue to work internally and with third party collaborators to develop new technologies to deliver our rnai therapeutics both directly to specific sites of disease  and systemically by intravenous or subcutaneous administration 
there is a risk that any drug discovery or development program may not produce revenue for a variety of reasons  including the possibility that we will not be able to adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the product candidate 
moreover  there are uncertainties specific to any new field of drug discovery  including rnai 
the successful development of any product candidate we develop is highly uncertain 
due to the numerous risks associated with developing drugs  we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature  timing and estimated costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of  or the period  if any  in which material net cash inflows will commence from  any potential product candidate 
these risks include the uncertainty of our ability to discover new product candidates  our ability to progress product candidates into pre clinical and clinical trials  the scope  rate of progress and cost of our pre clinical trials and other research and development activities  including those related to developing safe and effective ways of delivering sirnas into cells and tissues  the scope  rate of progress and cost of any clinical trials we commence  clinical trial results  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  
table of contents the terms  timing and success of any collaboration  licensing and other arrangements that we may establish  the cost  timing and success of regulatory filings and approvals or potential changes in regulations that govern our industry or the way in which they are interpreted or enforced  the cost and timing of establishing sufficient sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  the cost and timing of establishing sufficient clinical and commercial supplies for any product candidates and products that we may develop  and the effect of competing technological and market developments 
any failure to complete any stage of the development of any potential products in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial position and liquidity 
a discussion of some of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing our projects on schedule  or at all  and the potential consequences of failing to do so  are set forth in part i  item a of this annual report on form k under the heading risk factors 
strategic alliances a significant component of our business plan is to enter into strategic alliances and collaborations with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  academic institutions  research foundations and others  as appropriate  to gain access to funding  capabilities  technical resources and intellectual property to further our development efforts and to generate revenues 
our collaboration strategy is to form non exclusive platform and or multi target discovery alliances where our collaborators obtain access to our capabilities and intellectual property to develop their own rnai therapeutic products  and worldwide or specific geographic partnerships on select rnai therapeutic programs 
for example  we have entered into a broad  non exclusive platform license agreement with takeda  under which we are also collaborating with takeda on rnai drug discovery for one or more disease targets 
we have also established product alliances with cubist and medtronic for the development and commercialization of aln rsv and aln htt  respectively 
in addition  we have entered into a product alliance with kyowa hakko kirin for the development and commercialization of aln rsv in territories not covered by the cubist agreement  which include japan and other markets in asia 
we also have discovery and development alliances with isis and biogen idec 
we also seek to form or advance new ventures and opportunities in areas outside our primary focus on rnai therapeutics 
for example  during  we established alnylam biotherapeutics  an internal effort regarding the application of rnai technologies to improve the manufacturing processes for biologics  an approach that has the potential to create new business opportunities 
this effort is focused on applying rnai technologies to the biologics marketplace  which includes recombinant proteins and monoclonal antibodies 
in addition  during  we and isis formed regulus to capitalize on our technology and intellectual property in the field of microrna therapeutics 
regulus has formed collaborations with gsk and sanofi aventis to advance its efforts 
given the broad applications for rnai technology  in addition to our efforts on alnylam biotherapeutics and regulus  we believe new ventures and opportunities will be available to us 
to generate revenues from our intellectual property rights  we also grant licenses to biotechnology companies under our interferx program for the development and commercialization of rnai therapeutics for specified targets in which we have no direct strategic interest 
we also license key aspects of our intellectual property to companies active in the research products and services market  which includes the manufacture and sale of reagents 
our interferx and research product licenses aim to generate modest near term revenues that we can re invest in the development of our proprietary rnai therapeutics pipeline 
as of january   we had granted such licenses  on both an exclusive and non exclusive basis  to approximately companies 
since delivery of rnai therapeutics remains a major objective of our research activities  we also look to form collaboration and licensing arrangements with other companies and academic institutions to gain access to delivery technologies 
for example  we have entered into agreements with tekmira  mit  ubc and alcana  among others  to focus on various delivery strategies 
we have also entered into license agreements with isis  max planck innovation  tekmira  mit  crt  whitehead  stanford and utsw  as well as a number of other entities  to obtain rights to intellectual property in the field of rnai 

table of contents finally  we seek funding for the development of our proprietary rnai therapeutics pipeline from the government and foundations 
for example  in  the niaid awarded us a contract to advance the development of a broad spectrum rnai anti viral therapeutic against hemorrhagic fever virus  including the ebola virus 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and disclosure of contingent liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and could have a material impact on our reported results 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  we believe the following accounting policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments and estimates we use in preparing our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition our business strategy includes entering into collaborative license and development agreements with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies for the development and commercialization of our product candidates 
the terms of the agreements typically include non refundable license fees  funding of research and development  payments based upon achievement of clinical and pre clinical development milestones  manufacturing services and royalties on product sales 
non refundable license fees are recognized as revenue upon delivery of the license only if we have a contractual right to receive such payment  the contract price is fixed or determinable  the collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured and we have no further performance obligations under the license agreement 
multiple element arrangements  such as license and development arrangements  are analyzed to determine whether the deliverables  which often include a license and performance obligations such as research and steering committee services  can be separated or whether they must be accounted for as a single unit of accounting 
we recognize upfront license payments as revenue upon delivery of the license only if the license has stand alone value and the fair value of the undelivered performance obligations  typically including research and or steering committee services  can be determined 
if the fair value of the undelivered performance obligations can be determined  such obligations would then be accounted for separately as performed 
if the license is considered to either not have stand alone value or have stand alone value but the fair value of any of the undelivered performance obligations cannot be determined  the arrangement would then be accounted for as a single unit of accounting and the license payments and payments for performance obligations are recognized as revenue over the estimated period of when the performance obligations are performed 
whenever we determine that an arrangement should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting  we must determine the period over which the performance obligations will be performed and revenue will be recognized 
we recognize revenue using either a proportional performance or straight line method 
we recognize revenue using the proportional performance method when we can reasonably estimate the level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement and such performance obligations are provided on a best efforts basis 
direct labor hours or full time equivalents are typically used as the measure of performance 
the amount of revenue recognized under the proportional performance method is determined by multiplying the total payments under the contract  excluding royalties and payments contingent upon achievement of substantive milestones  by the ratio of level of effort incurred to date to estimated total level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under the arrangement 
revenue is limited to the lesser of the cumulative amount of payments received or the cumulative amount of revenue earned  as determined using the proportional performance method  as of the period ending date 
if we cannot reasonably estimate the level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement  we recognize revenue under the arrangement on a straight line basis over the period we expect to 
table of contents complete our performance obligations 
revenue is limited to the lesser of the cumulative amount of payments received or the cumulative amount of revenue earned  as determined using the straight line method  as of the period ending date 
significant management judgment is required in determining the level of effort required under an arrangement and the period over which we are expected to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement 
steering committee services that are not inconsequential or perfunctory and that are determined to be performance obligations are combined with other research services or performance obligations required under an arrangement  if any  in determining the level of effort required in an arrangement and the period over which we expect to complete our aggregate performance obligations 
many of our collaboration agreements entitle us to additional payments upon the achievement of performance based milestones 
if the achievement of a milestone is considered probable at the inception of the collaboration  the related milestone payment is included with other collaboration consideration  such as upfront fees and research funding  in our revenue model 
milestones that involve substantial effort on our part and the achievement of which are not considered probable at the inception of the collaboration are considered substantive milestones 
substantive milestones are included in our revenue model when achievement of the milestone is considered probable 
as future substantive milestones are achieved  a portion of the milestone payment  equal to the percentage of the performance period completed when the milestone is achieved  multiplied by the amount of the milestone payment  will be recognized as revenue upon achievement of such milestone 
the remaining portion of the milestone will be recognized over the remaining performance period using the proportional performance or straight line method 
milestones that are tied to regulatory approval are not considered probable of being achieved until such approval is received 
milestones tied to counter party performance are not included in our revenue model until the performance conditions are met 
for revenue generating arrangements where we  as a vendor  provide consideration to a licensor or collaborator  as a customer  we apply the accounting standard that governs such transactions 
this standard addresses the accounting for revenue arrangements where both the vendor and the customer make cash payments to each other for services and or products 
a payment to a customer is presumed to be a reduction of the selling price unless we receive an identifiable benefit for the payment and we can reasonably estimate the fair value of the benefit received 
payments to a customer that are deemed a reduction of selling price are recorded first as a reduction of revenue  to the extent of both cumulative revenue recorded to date and probable future revenues  which include any unamortized deferred revenue balances  under all arrangements with such customer  and then as an expense 
payments that are not deemed to be a reduction of selling price are recorded as an expense 
we evaluate our collaborative agreements for proper classification in our consolidated statements of operations based on the nature of the underlying activity 
transactions between collaborators recorded in our consolidated statements of operations are recorded on either a gross or net basis  depending on the characteristics of the collaborative relationship 
we generally reflect amounts due under our collaborative agreements related to cost sharing of development activities as a reduction of research and development expense 
amounts received prior to satisfying the above revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
although we follow detailed guidelines in measuring revenue  certain judgments affect the application of our revenue policy 
for example  in connection with our existing collaboration agreements  we have recorded on our balance sheet short term and long term deferred revenue based on our best estimate of when such revenue will be recognized 
short term deferred revenue consists of amounts that are expected to be recognized as revenue in the next months 
amounts that we expect will not be recognized prior to the next months are classified as long term deferred revenue 
however  this estimate is based on our current operating plan and  if our operating plan should change in the future  we may recognize a different amount of deferred revenue over the next month period 
the estimate of deferred revenue also reflects management s estimate of the periods of our involvement in certain of our collaborations 
our performance obligations under these collaborations consist of participation on steering committees and the performance of other research and development services 
in certain instances  the timing of satisfying these obligations can be difficult to estimate 
accordingly  our estimates may change in the future 
such changes to estimates would result in a change in revenue recognition amounts 
if these estimates and 
table of contents judgments change over the course of these agreements  it may affect the timing and amount of revenue that we recognize and record in future periods 
at december   we had short term and long term deferred revenue of million and million  respectively  related to our collaborations 
effective beginning in january  significant changes to these contracts in the future would trigger reassessment of the timing of revenue recognition under the new revenue recognition accounting standard 
we recognize revenue under government cost reimbursement contracts as we perform the underlying research and development activities 
novartis 
in consideration for rights granted to novartis under the collaboration and license agreement  novartis made an upfront payment of million to us in october to partly reimburse costs previously incurred by us to develop in vivo rnai technology 
the collaboration and license agreement included terms under which novartis provided us with research funding 
in addition  for rnai therapeutic products developed under the agreement  if any  we are entitled to receive milestone payments upon achievement of certain specified development and annual net sales events  up to an aggregate of million per therapeutic product  as well as royalties on annual net sales of any such product 
we initially recorded as deferred revenue the non refundable million upfront payment and the million premium that represented the difference between the purchase price and the closing price of our common stock on the date of the stock purchase from novartis 
these payments  in addition to research funding and certain milestone payments  together total approximately million  and are being amortized into revenue using the proportional performance method over ten years 
under this method  we estimate the level of effort to be expended over the term of the agreement and recognize revenue based on the lesser of the amount calculated based on the proportional performance of total expected revenue or the amount of non refundable payments earned 
as future substantive milestones are achieved  and to the extent they are within the period of performance  milestone payments will be recognized as revenue on a proportional performance basis over the contract s entire performance period  starting with the contract s commencement 
a portion of the milestone payment  equal to the percentage of total performance completed when the milestone is achieved  multiplied by the milestone payment  will be recognized as revenue upon achievement of the milestone 
the remaining portion of the milestone will be recognized over the remaining performance period under the proportional performance method 
we believe our estimated period of performance under the novartis collaboration and license agreement is ten years  which includes the three year initial term of the agreement  the two one year extensions elected by novartis and limited support as part of a technology transfer until  the fifth anniversary of the completion of the research term under the collaboration and license agreement 
we continue to use an expected term of ten years in our proportional performance model 
we reevaluate the expected term when new information is known that could affect our estimate 
in the event our period of performance is different than we estimated  we will adjust the amount of revenue recognized on a prospective basis 
at december   deferred revenue under the novartis collaboration and license agreement was million 
roche 
we received aggregate proceeds from roche of million in august  of which million was recorded as deferred revenue in connection with this alliance 
in exchange for our contributions under the collaboration agreement  for each rnai therapeutic product developed by roche  its affiliates or sublicensees under the collaboration agreement  we are entitled to receive milestone payments upon achievement of specified development and sales events  totaling up to an aggregate of million per therapeutic target  together with royalty payments based on worldwide annual net sales  if any 
in addition  we and roche established a discovery collaboration in october  pursuant to the terms of the roche license and collaboration agreement and subject to our existing contractual obligations to third parties 
we have determined that the deliverables under our agreements with roche include the license  the alnylam europe assets and employees  the steering committees joint steering committee and future technology committee and the services under the discovery collaboration 
we have determined that  pursuant to the accounting guidance governing revenue recognition on multiple element arrangements  the license and assets of alnylam europe are not separable from the undelivered services ie  the steering committees and discovery collaboration and  accordingly  the license and the services are being treated as a single unit of accounting 
when multiple 
table of contents deliverables are accounted for as a single unit of accounting  we base our revenue recognition pattern on the final deliverable 
under the roche alliance  the steering committee services and the discovery collaboration services are the final deliverables and all such services will end  contractually  five years from the effective date of the license and collaboration agreement 
we are recognizing the roche related revenue on a straight line basis over five years because we cannot reasonably estimate the total level of effort required to complete our service obligations under the license and collaboration agreement and therefore  cannot utilize a proportional performance model 
as future substantive milestones are achieved  we will recognize as revenue a portion of the milestone payment  equal to the percentage of the performance period completed when the milestone is achieved  multiplied by the amount of the milestone payment 
we will recognize the remaining portion of the milestone over the remaining performance period on a straight line basis 
in november  roche announced the discontinuation of certain activities in research and early development  including their rnai research efforts 
the remaining deliverables under our license and collaboration agreement currently remain in effect 
roche may assign its rights and obligations under the license and collaboration agreement to a third party in connection with the sale or transfer of its entire rnai business 
we will continue to recognize the roche related revenue on a straight line basis over five years 
if roche terminates the license and collaboration agreement or assigns its rights and obligations thereunder to a third party  at such time  we will reassess our deliverables and the period over which we will complete our performance obligations under the license and collaboration agreement 
takeda 
in consideration for the rights granted to takeda under the takeda agreement  takeda paid us an upfront payment of million in june and agreed to pay us an additional million upon achievement of specified technology transfer milestones 
of this million  million was paid in october  million was paid in march and million is due upon achievement of the last specified technology transfer activities  but no later than the second quarter of if takeda elects to expand its license to additional therapeutic areas  takeda will be required to pay us million for each of up to approximately total additional fields selected  if any  comprising substantially all other fields of human disease  as identified and agreed upon by the parties 
in addition  for each rnai therapeutic product developed by takeda  its affiliates and sublicensees  we are entitled to receive specified development and commercialization milestones  totaling up to million per product  together with royalty payments based on worldwide annual net sales  if any 
pursuant to the takeda agreement  we and takeda have also agreed to collaborate on the research of rnai therapeutics directed to one or two disease targets agreed to by the parties  subject to our existing contractual obligations with third parties 
takeda also has the option  subject to certain conditions  to collaborate with us on the research and development of rnai drug delivery technology for targets agreed to by the parties 
in addition  takeda has a right of first negotiation for the development and commercialization of our rnai therapeutic products in the asian territory  excluding our aln rsv program 
we have a similar right of first negotiation to participate with takeda in the development and commercialization in the united states of licensed products 
the collaboration is governed by a jttc  a jrcc and a jdcc  each of which is comprised of an equal number of representatives from each party 
we have determined that the deliverables under the takeda agreement include the license  the joint committees the jttc  jrcc and jdcc  the technology transfer activities and the services that we will be obligated to perform under the research collaboration with takeda 
we have determined that  pursuant to the accounting guidance governing revenue recognition on multiple element arrangements  the license and undelivered services ie  the joint committees and the research collaboration are not separable and  accordingly  the license and services are being treated as a single unit of accounting 
under the takeda agreement  the last elements to be delivered are the jdcc and jttc services  each of which has a life of no more than seven years 
we are recognizing the upfront payment of million and the million of technology transfer milestones  the receipt of which we believed was probable at the commencement of the collaboration  on a straight line basis over seven years because we are unable to reasonably estimate the level of effort to fulfill these obligations  primarily because the effort required under the research collaboration is largely unknown  and therefore  cannot utilize a proportional performance model 
as future substantive milestones are achieved  we will recognize as revenue a portion of the milestone payment  equal to the percentage of the performance period completed when the milestone is achieved  multiplied 
table of contents by the amount of the milestone payment 
we will recognize the remaining portion of the milestone over the remaining performance period on a straight line basis 
kyowa hakko kirin 
under the terms of the kyowa hakko kirin agreement  in june  kyowa hakko kirin paid us an upfront cash payment of million 
in addition  kyowa hakko kirin is required to make payments to us upon achievement of specified development and sales milestones totaling up to million  and royalty payments based on annual net sales  if any  of rnai therapeutics for the treatment of rsv by kyowa hakko kirin  its affiliates and sublicenses in the licensed territory 
our collaboration with kyowa hakko kirin is governed by a joint steering committee that is comprised of an equal number of representatives from each party 
kyowa hakko kirin is responsible  at its expense  for all development activities under the development plan that are reasonably necessary for the regulatory approval and commercialization of an rnai therapeutic for the treatment of rsv in japan and the rest of the licensed territory 
we are responsible for supply of the product to kyowa hakko kirin under a supply agreement unless kyowa hakko kirin elects  prior to the first commercial sale of the product in the licensed territory  to manufacture the product itself or arrange for a third party to manufacture the product 
we have determined that the deliverables under the kyowa hakko kirin agreement include the license  the joint steering committee  the manufacturing services and any additional rsv specific rnai therapeutic compounds that comprise the aln rsv program 
we have determined that  pursuant to the accounting guidance governing revenue recognition on multiple element arrangements  the individual deliverables are not separable and  accordingly  must be accounted for as a single unit of accounting 
we are currently unable to reasonably estimate our period of performance under the kyowa hakko kirin agreement  as we are unable to estimate the timeline of our deliverables related to the fixed price option granted to kyowa hakko kirin for any additional compounds 
we are deferring all revenue under the kyowa hakko kirin agreement until we are able to reasonably estimate our period of performance 
we will continue to reassess whether we can reasonably estimate the period of performance to fulfill our obligations under the kyowa hakko kirin agreement 
cubist 
under the terms of the cubist agreement  we and cubist share responsibility for developing licensed products in north america and each bears one half of the related development costs  subject to the terms of the november amendment 
our collaboration with cubist for the development of licensed products in north america is governed by a joint steering committee comprised of an equal number of representatives from each party 
cubist will have the sole right to commercialize licensed products in north america with costs associated with such activities and any resulting profits or losses to be split equally between us and cubist 
throughout the rest of the world  referred to as the royalty territory  excluding asia  where we have previously partnered our aln rsv program with kyowa hakko kirin  cubist has an exclusive  royalty bearing license to develop and commercialize licensed products 
in consideration for the rights granted to cubist under the agreement  in january  cubist paid us an upfront cash payment of million 
cubist also has an obligation under the agreement to pay us milestone payments  totaling up to an aggregate of million  upon the achievement of specified development and sales events in the royalty territory 
in addition  if licensed products are successfully developed  cubist will be required to pay us double digit royalties on net sales of licensed products in the royalty territory  if any  subject to offsets under certain circumstances 
upon achievement of certain development milestones  we will have the right to convert the north american co development and profit sharing arrangement into a royalty bearing license and  in addition to royalties on net sales in north america  if any  will be entitled to receive additional milestone payments totaling up to an aggregate of million upon achievement of specified development and sales events in north america  subject to the timing of the conversion by us and the regulatory status of a licensed product at the time of conversion 
if we make the conversion to a royalty bearing license with respect to north america  then north america becomes part of the royalty territory 
we have determined that the deliverables under the cubist agreement include the licenses  technology transfer related to the aln rsv program  the joint steering committee and the development and manufacturing services that we are obligated to perform during the development period 
we have determined that  pursuant to the accounting guidance governing revenue recognition on multiple element arrangements  the licenses and undelivered services are not separable and  accordingly  the licenses and services are being treated as a single 
table of contents unit of accounting 
under the cubist agreement  the last element to be delivered is the development and manufacturing services  which have an expected life of approximately eight years 
we are recognizing the upfront payment of million on a straight line basis over approximately eight years because we are unable to reasonably estimate the level of effort to fulfill our performance obligations and therefore  cannot utilize a proportional performance model 
as future substantive milestones are achieved  we will recognize as revenue a portion of the milestone payment  equal to the percentage of the performance period completed when the milestone is achieved  multiplied by the amount of the milestone payment 
we will recognize the remaining portion of the milestone over the remaining performance period on a straight line basis 
under the terms of the cubist agreement  we and cubist share responsibility for developing licensed products in north america and each bears one half of the related development costs  provided that under the terms of the november amendment  we are funding the advancement of aln rsv for adult lung transplant patients and cubist retains an opt in right 
in december  we and cubist jointly made a portfolio decision to put the development of aln rsv on hold 
for revenue generating arrangements that involve cost sharing between both parties  we present the results of activities for which we act as the principal on a gross basis and report any payments received from  or made to  other collaborators based on other applicable gaap  or  in the absence of other applicable gaap  analogy to authoritative accounting literature or a reasonable  rational and consistently applied accounting policy election 
as we are not considered the principal under the cubist agreement  we record any amounts due from cubist as a reduction of research and development expense 
government contracts 
we recognize revenue under government cost reimbursement contracts as we perform the underlying research and development activities 
accounting for income taxes we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the tax position 
the tax benefits recognized in our financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 
we operate in the united states and germany where our income tax returns are subject to audit and adjustment by local tax authorities 
the nature of the uncertain tax positions is often very complex and subject to change  and the amounts at issue can be substantial 
we develop our cumulative probability assessment of the measurement of uncertain tax positions using internal experience  judgment and assistance from professional advisors 
we refine estimates as we become aware of additional information 
any outcome upon settlement that differs from our current estimate may result in additional tax expense in future periods 
at december   we had million of total gross unrecognized tax benefits that  if recognized  would favorably impact our effective income tax rate in future periods 
we recognize income taxes when transactions are recorded in our consolidated statements of operations  with deferred taxes provided for items that are recognized in different periods for financial statement and tax reporting purposes 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in addition  we estimate our exposures relating to uncertain tax positions and establish reserves for such exposures when they become probable and reasonably estimable 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded a provision for income taxes of million  million and million  respectively 
we generated us taxable income during and due to the recognition of certain proceeds received from the roche and takeda alliances 
during  we generated sufficient net operating losses to carry back to and to obtain a refund of taxes paid in those years  resulting in a realization of our net deferred tax asset 
as a result  during  we reclassified million of our deferred tax asset to income taxes receivable 
we expect to receive this income tax refund in we were subject to federal alternative minimum tax and state income taxes in and at december   we had a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets to the extent it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized 
at december   we had federal and state net operating loss 
table of contents carryforwards of million and million  respectively  to reduce future taxable income that will expire at various dates through at december   we had federal and state research and development credit carryforwards of million and million  respectively  available to reduce future tax liabilities that expire at various dates through at december   we had foreign tax credit carryforwards of million available to reduce future tax liabilities that expire in at december   we had alternative minimum tax credits of million available to reduce future regular tax liabilities to the extent such regular tax less other non refundable credits exceeds the tentative minimum tax 
we have a valuation allowance against the net operating loss and credit deferred tax assets as it is unlikely that we will realize these assets 
ownership changes  as defined in the internal revenue code  including those resulting from the issuance of common stock in connection with our public offerings  may limit the amount of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards that can be utilized to offset future taxable income or tax liability 
the amount of the limitation is determined in accordance with section of the internal revenue code 
we have determined that there is no limitation on the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in accordance with section of the internal revenue code in accounting for stock based compensation we account for all stock based awards granted to non employees at their fair value and generally recognize compensation expense over the vesting period of the award 
determining the amount of stock based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates of fair values of stock options as of the grant date 
we calculate the grant date fair values using the black scholes valuation model 
our expected stock price volatility assumption is based on a combination of the historical and implied volatility of our publicly traded stock 
for stock option awards granted during the year ended december   we used a weighted average expected stock price volatility assumption of 
our expected life assumption is based on the equal weighting of our historical data and the historical data of our pharmaceutical and biotechnology peers 
our weighted average expected term was years for the year ended december  we utilize a dividend yield of zero based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and currently have no intention to pay cash dividends 
the risk free interest rate used for each grant is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for instruments with a similar expected life 
at december   the estimated fair value of unvested employee awards was million  net of estimated forfeitures 
we will recognize this amount over the weighted average remaining vesting period of approximately years for these awards 
stock based employee compensation expense was million for the year ended december  however  we cannot currently predict the total amount of stock based compensation expense to be recognized in any future period because such amounts will depend on levels of stock based payments granted in the future as well as the portion of the awards that actually vest 
the stock compensation accounting standard requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the term forfeitures is distinct from cancellations or expirations and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered stock option 
we currently expect  based on an analysis of our historical forfeitures  excluding the impact of our corporate restructuring  that approximately of our stock options will actually vest  and therefore have applied an annual forfeiture rate of to all unvested stock options at december  ultimately  the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those shares that vest 
accounting for joint venture we account for our interest in regulus using the equity method of accounting 
we reviewed the consolidation guidance that defines a variable interest entity  or vie  and concluded that regulus currently qualifies as a vie 
we record any gain or loss recognized from the issuance of stock by our equity method investee as other income expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
we do not consolidate regulus financial results as we lack the power to direct the activities that could significantly impact the economic success of regulus 
estimated liability for development costs we record accrued liabilities related to expenses for which service providers have not yet billed us with respect to products or services that we have received  specifically related to ongoing pre clinical studies and clinical trials 
these costs primarily relate to third party clinical management costs  laboratory and analysis costs  toxicology 
table of contents studies and investigator fees 
we have multiple product candidates in concurrent pre clinical studies and clinical trials at multiple clinical sites throughout the world 
in order to ensure that we have adequately provided for ongoing pre clinical and clinical development costs during the period in which we incur such costs  we maintain an accrual to cover these expenses 
we update our estimate for this accrual on at least a quarterly basis 
the assessment of these costs is a subjective process that requires judgment 
upon settlement  these costs may differ materially from the amounts accrued in our consolidated financial statements 
our historical accrual estimates have not been materially different from our actual amounts

the following table summarizes our total consolidated net revenues from research collaborators  for the periods indicated  in thousands year ended december  roche takeda novartis government contract other research collaborator interferx program  research reagent license and other total net revenues from research collaborators revenues remained relatively consistent for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  under the roche alliance  we are recognizing revenue on a straight line basis over five years  which equates to approximately million per quarter 
revenues under the roche alliance in also included the achievement of a development milestone 
under the takeda alliance  we are recognizing revenue on a straight line basis over seven years  which equates to approximately million per quarter 
in september  novartis exercised its right under the collaboration and license agreement to select designated gene targets  for which novartis has exclusive rights to discover  develop and commercialize rnai therapeutic products using our intellectual property and technology 
novartis declined to exercise its non exclusive option to integrate into its operations our fundamental and chemistry intellectual property under the terms of the collaboration and license agreement  known as the integration option 
if novartis had elected to exercise the integration option  novartis would have been required to make additional payments to us totaling million 
in october  the fifth and final year of the research program was substantially completed under the novartis collaboration and license agreement  and consequently  we currently do not expect to have any significant revenues from novartis in at december   deferred revenue under the novartis collaboration and license agreement was million 

table of contents for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   government contract revenues decreased primarily as a result of a decrease in the research and development activities related to our contract with the niaid 
this contract was originally expected to be completed in september we and the niaid agreed to a no cost extension of the contract through december during which time we utilized the funds remaining under the contract 
we currently do not expect to have any significant government contract revenues in other research collaborator revenues increased in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  primarily as a result of the million sublicense fee recognized in connection with regulus june alliance with sanofi aventis  representing of the million upfront payment from sanofi aventis to regulus 
the increase in interferx program  research reagent license and other revenues for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was primarily a result of progress and milestones achieved related to our interferx and other programs 
we also had million of deferred revenue at december   which consists of payments we have received from collaborators  primarily roche  takeda  kyowa hakko kirin and cubist  but have not yet recognized pursuant to our revenue recognition policies 
for the foreseeable future  we expect our revenues to continue to be derived primarily from our alliances with roche  takeda and cubist  as well as other strategic alliances  collaborations  foundation funding  government contracts and licensing activities

table of contents research and development expenses decreased slightly during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  due primarily to license fees paid to isis in april in connection with the ssrnai collaborative effort with isis  which we terminated in november this decrease was partially offset by restructuring expenses related to employee severance  benefits and related costs incurred in connection with our corporate restructuring  which was implemented at the end of september and included an approximate workforce reduction 
in addition  prior to our corporate restructuring  there were higher compensation and related expenses during as compared to due to higher average research and development headcount to support our technology platform and expanding product pipeline 
we expect to continue to devote a substantial portion of our resources to research and development expenses as we continue development of our and our collaborators product candidates and focus on continuing to develop drug delivery related technologies  however we expect that research and development expenses will decrease in primarily as a result of our corporate restructuring 
a significant portion of our research and development costs are not tracked by project as they benefit multiple projects or our technology platform and because our most advanced programs are in the early stages of clinical development 
however  our collaboration agreements contain cost sharing arrangements pursuant to which certain costs incurred under the project are reimbursed 
costs reimbursed under the agreements typically include certain direct external costs and a negotiated full time equivalent labor rate for the actual time worked on the project 
in addition  we are reimbursed under our government contracts for certain allowable costs including direct internal and external costs 
as a result  although a significant portion of our research and development expenses are not tracked on a project by project basis  we do track direct external costs attributable to  and the actual time our employees worked on  our collaborations and government contracts

the carrying value of our investment in joint venture regulus therapeutics inc immediately prior to the conversion to a c corporation exceeded of the net assets of regulus by approximately million 
upon conversion  this amount was allocated to the intellectual property of regulus and  because the intellectual property was determined to be in process research and development  the million was recorded as a charge to expense 
this charge is included in equity in loss of joint venture regulus therapeutics inc in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  in october  in connection with its strategic alliance with regulus  sanofi aventis made a million equity investment in regulus  resulting in sanofi aventis owning approximately of regulus 
following this investment  we and isis own approximately and  respectively  of regulus 
separate financial information for regulus is included in exhibit to this annual report on form k

we are recognizing as revenue the million in upfront and technology transfer milestone payments made or due to us under the takeda alliance on a straight line basis over seven years  which equates to approximately million per quarter 
also contributing to the increase in were higher revenues under the roche alliance related primarily to a development milestone achieved in under the roche alliance  we are recognizing revenue on a straight line basis over five years  which equates to approximately million per quarter 
the decrease in novartis revenues during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was due in part to a reduction in the number of resources allocated to the broad novartis alliance 
for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   government contract revenues decreased primarily as a result of the wind down of our collaboration with dtra 
following a program review  in february  we and dtra determined not to continue this program and  accordingly  the remaining funds were not accessed 

table of contents other research collaborator revenues increased in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  due primarily to our alliance with cubist 
in consideration for the rights granted to cubist under the agreement  in january  cubist paid us an upfront cash payment of million 
we are recognizing this million payment as revenue on a straight line basis over approximately eight years 
the decrease in interferx program  research reagent license and other revenues for the year ended december  compared to the prior year was due to milestone payments from certain interferx licensees received in we also had million of deferred revenue at december   which consisted of payments received from collaborators  primarily roche  takeda  kyowa hakko kirin and cubist  that we had yet to recognize pursuant to our revenue recognition policies

also contributing to the increase in research and development expenses for the year ended december  was an increase in compensation and related  non cash stock based compensation and facilities related expenses due primarily to additional research and development headcount to support our alliances and expanding product pipeline 
partially offsetting these increases  external services expenses decreased during the year ended december  as a result of lower pre clinical activities due primarily to the wind down of our collaboration with dtra 
in addition  under the terms 
table of contents of our january agreement with cubist  we and cubist each were responsible for one half of the development costs for our aln rsv program through november for the year ended december   we recorded amounts due from cubist of million as a reduction to research and development expenses

also contributing to the increase were higher non cash stock based compensation and compensation and related expenses due to a modest increase in general and administrative headcount in to support our growth 
other income expense we incurred million equity in loss of joint venture regulus therapeutics inc for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  related to our share of the net losses incurred by regulus 
through december   we were recognizing the first million of losses of regulus as equity in loss of joint venture regulus therapeutics inc in our consolidated statements of operations because we were responsible for funding those losses through our initial million cash contribution 
beginning in january  in connection with the conversion of regulus to a c corporation  we were recognizing approximately of the income and losses of regulus 
the carrying value of our investment in joint venture regulus therapeutics inc immediately prior to the conversion to a c corporation exceeded of the net assets of regulus by approximately million 
upon conversion  this amount was allocated to the intellectual property of regulus and  because the intellectual property was determined to be in process research and development  the million was recorded as a charge to expense 
this charge is included in equity in loss of joint venture regulus therapeutics inc in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  interest income was million in as compared to million in the decrease in was due primarily to significantly lower average interest rates 
interest expense was zero in as compared to million in interest expense in was related to borrowings under our lines of credit used to finance capital equipment purchases

our investment objectives are  primarily  to assure liquidity and preservation of capital and  secondarily  to obtain investment income 
all of our investments in debt securities are recorded at fair value and are available for sale 
fair value is determined based on quoted market prices and models using observable data inputs 
we have not recorded any impairment charges to our fixed income marketable securities at december  operating activities we have required significant amounts of cash to fund our operating activities as a result of net losses since our inception 
the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was due primarily to our net loss and other changes in our working capital  as well as a decrease in deferred revenue of million 
we had a decrease in deferred revenue of million for year ended december   partially offset by an increase in accounts payable of million 
we had an increase in deferred revenue of million for the year ended december  due primarily to the proceeds received from our takeda and kyowa hakko kirin alliances 
cash used in operating activities is adjusted for non cash items to reconcile net loss to net cash provided by or used in operating activities 
these non cash adjustments consist primarily of stock based compensation  equity in loss of joint venture regulus therapeutics inc and depreciation and amortization 
we expect that we will require significant amounts of cash to fund our operating activities for the foreseeable future as we continue to develop and advance our research and development initiatives 
the actual amount of overall expenditures will depend on numerous factors  including the timing of expenses  the timing and terms of collaboration agreements or other strategic transactions  if any  and the timing and progress of our research and development efforts

during the current downturn in global financial markets  some companies have experienced difficulties accessing their cash equivalents and investment securities and raising capital generally  which have had a material adverse impact on their liquidity 
in addition  the current economic downturn has diminished the availability of capital and may limit our ability to access these markets to obtain financing in the future 
based on our current operating plan  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and fixed income marketable securities  for which we have not recognized any impairment charges  together with the cash we expect to generate under our current alliances  will be sufficient to fund our planned operations for at least the next several years  during which time we expect to further the development of our product candidates  conduct clinical trials  extend the capabilities of our technology platform  including through new business initiatives  and continue to prosecute patent applications and otherwise build and maintain our patent portfolio 
however  we may require significant additional funds earlier than we currently expect in order to develop  conduct clinical trials for and commercialize any product candidates 
in the longer term  we may seek additional funding through additional collaborative arrangements and public or private financings 
additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
in addition  the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders 
for example  if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  further dilution to our existing stockholders may result 
in addition  as a condition to providing additional funds to us  future investors may demand  and may be granted  rights superior to those of existing stockholders 
if we are unable to obtain funding on a timely basis  we may be required to significantly curtail one or more of our research or development programs 
we also could be required to seek funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require us to relinquish rights to some of our technologies or product candidates that we would otherwise pursue 
even if we are able to raise additional funds in a timely manner  our future capital requirements may vary from what we expect and will depend on many factors  including our progress in demonstrating that sirnas can be active as drugs  our ability to develop relatively standard procedures for selecting and modifying sirna product candidates  progress in our research and development programs  as well as the magnitude of these programs

off balance sheet arrangements in connection with our license agreements with max planck gesellschaft zur forderung der wissenschaften ev and max planck innovation  collectively  max planck  relating to the tuschl i and ii patent applications  we are required to indemnify max planck for certain damages arising in connection with the intellectual property rights licensed under the agreements 
under this indemnification agreement with max planck  we are responsible for paying the costs of any litigation relating to the license agreements or the underlying intellectual property rights 
these amounts are charged to general and administrative expense 
in addition  we are a party to a number of agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business  which contain typical provisions that obligate us to indemnify the other parties to such agreements upon the occurrence of certain events 
these indemnification obligations are considered off balance sheet arrangements in accordance with gaap 
to date  other than the costs associated with the litigation described in part i  item of this annual report on form k  which we are responsible for under our indemnification agreement with max planck  we have not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to such obligations in our consolidated financial statements

contractual obligations in the table below  we set forth our enforceable and legally binding obligations and future commitments at december   as well as obligations related to contracts that we are likely to continue  regardless of the fact that they were cancelable at december  some of the figures that we include in this table are based on management s estimates and assumptions about these obligations  including their duration  the possibility of renewal  anticipated actions by third parties  and other factors

we in license technology from a number of sources 
pursuant to these in license agreements  we will be required to make additional payments if and when we achieve specified development and regulatory milestones 
to the extent we are unable to reasonably predict the likelihood  timing or amount of such payments  we have excluded them from the table above 
recent accounting pronouncements in april  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued a new accounting standard  which provides guidance in applying the milestone method of revenue recognition to research or development arrangements 
under this guidance management may recognize revenue contingent upon the achievement of a milestone in the period in which the milestone is achieved only if the milestone meets all the criteria within the guidance to be considered substantive 
this standard is effective on a prospective basis for research and development milestones achieved in fiscal years beginning on or after june  we are currently evaluating the potential impact of this accounting standard on our consolidated financial statements  however we do not believe it will have a significant impact 
in october  the fasb issued a new accounting standard  which amends existing revenue recognition accounting pronouncements and provides accounting principles and application guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the arrangement should be separated and the consideration allocated 
this standard eliminates the requirement to establish the fair value of undelivered products and services and instead provides for separate revenue recognition based upon management s estimate of the selling price for an undelivered item when there is no other means to determine the fair value of that undelivered item 
previously  accounting principles required that the fair value of the undelivered item be the price of the item either sold in a separate transaction between unrelated third parties or the price charged for each item when the item is sold separately by the vendor 
determining the fair value using these methods was difficult when the product was not individually sold because of its unique features 
if the fair value of all of the elements in the arrangement was not determinable  then revenue was deferred until all of the items were delivered or fair value was determined 
this new approach is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  this new accounting standard will not affect our existing collaborations but will affect how we recognize revenue for future collaborations 
in june  the fasb issued a new accounting standard  which amends previously issued accounting guidance for the consolidation of a vie to require an enterprise to determine whether its variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a vie 
this amended consolidation guidance for vies also replaces the existing quantitative approach for identifying which enterprise should consolidate a vie  which was based on which enterprise was exposed to a majority of the risks and rewards  with a qualitative approach  based on which enterprise has both the power to direct the economically significant activities of the entity and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie 
this new accounting standard has broad implications and may affect how we account for the consolidation of common structures  such as joint ventures  equity method investments  collaboration and other agreements  and purchase arrangements 
under this revised consolidation guidance  more entities may meet the definition of a vie  and the determination about who should consolidate a vie is required to be evaluated continuously 
we adopted this standard effective january  and have determined that the adoption did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as part of our investment portfolio  we own financial instruments that are sensitive to market risks 
the investment portfolio is used to preserve our capital until it is required to fund operations  including our research and development activities 
our marketable securities consist of us government and municipal obligations  high grade corporate notes and commercial paper 
all of our investments in debt securities are classified as available for sale and are recorded at fair value 
our available for sale investments in debt securities are sensitive to changes in interest rates and changes in the credit ratings of the issuers 
interest rate changes would result in a change in the net fair value of these financial instruments due to the difference between the market interest rate and the market interest rate at the date of purchase of the financial instrument 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by basis points  or one half of a percentage point  from levels at december   the net fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments would have resulted in a hypothetical decline of million 
a downgrade in the credit rating of an issuer of a debt security or further deterioration of the credit markets could result in a decline in the fair value of the debt instruments 
our investment guidelines prohibit investment in auction rate securities and we do not believe we have any direct exposure to losses relating from mortgage based securities or derivatives related thereto such as credit default swaps 
we did not record any impairment charges during the year ended december
