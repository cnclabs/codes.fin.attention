any decrease in royalties derived from the sales of tc and zeffix could significantly reduce earnings the company receives royalties from gsk on the worldwide sales of tc and zeffix 
in  the company royalty income relating to tc and zeffix sales was million million  million 
any factors that decrease sales of tc and zeffix by gsk could significantly reduce the company royalty revenue  and negatively affect results of operations 
these include  but are not limited to loss of patent protection or ability of competitors to challenge or circumvent patents see item legal proceedings and note  commitments and contingencies  legal proceedings to the consolidated financial statements set forth in this annual report on form k for details of current patent litigation  reduction in the production of tc and zeffix  technological advances  government action intervention  public opinion towards aids treatments  and product liability claims 
the failure to obtain and maintain reimbursement  or an adequate level of reimbursement  by third party payers in a timely manner for the company products may impact future revenues and earnings the company revenues are partly dependent on the level of reimbursement provided to the company by governmental reimbursement schemes for pharmaceutical products 
changes to governmental policy or practices could adversely affect the company revenues  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the reimbursement of treatment established by health care providers  private health insurers and other organizations  such as health maintenance organizations and managed care organizations are under downward pressure and this  in turn  could impact on the prices at which the company can sell its products 
the market for pharmaceutical products could be significantly influenced by the following  which could result in lower prices for the company products and or a reduced demand for the company products the ongoing trend toward managed health care  particularly in the us  
table of contents legislative proposals to reform health care and government insurance programs in many of the company markets  and price controls and non reimbursement of new and highly priced medicines for which the economic and therapeutic rationales are not established 
the prices for certain of the company products when commercialized  in particular products for the treatment of rare genetic diseases such as replagal  elaprase and vpriv  may be high compared to other pharmaceutical products 
the company may encounter particular difficulty in obtaining satisfactory pricing and reimbursement for its products  particularly those with a high cost of treatment 
the failure to obtain and maintain pricing and reimbursement at satisfactory levels for such products may adversely affect the company s revenues  financial condition and results of operations 
a disruption to the product supply chain may result in the company being unable to continue marketing or developing a product or may result in the company being unable to do so on a commercially viable basis the company sources its products from third party contract manufacturers  and for certain products has its own manufacturing capability 
in the event of either the company failure or the failure of any third party contract manufacturer to comply with mandatory manufacturing standards often referred to as current good manufacturing standards or cgmp in the countries in which the company sells or intends to sell or have its products sold or suffering another form of disruption to the supply chain  the company may experience a delay in supply or be unable to market or develop its products 
the company dual sources certain key products and or active ingredients 
however  the company currently relies on a single source for production of the final drug product for each of adderall xr  fosrenol  firazyr  intuniv  carbatrol  pentasa  vpriv  resolor and xagrid and relies on a single active ingredient source for each of elaprase  firazyr  fosrenol  reminyl  replagal  vpriv  resolor and xagrid 
in the event of financial failure of a third party contract manufacturer or the failure of the third party manufacturer to comply with its contractual obligations  the company may experience a delay in supply or be unable to market or develop its products 
this could have a material adverse affect on the company financial condition and results of operations 
there is no assurance that suppliers will continue to supply on commercially viable terms  or be able to supply components that meet regulatory requirements 
the company is also subject to the risk that suppliers will not be able to meet the quantities needed to meet market requirements which may result in the shortage of product supplies in the market the development and approval of the company products depends on the ability to procure active ingredients and special packaging materials from sources approved by regulatory authorities 
as the marketing approval process requires manufacturers to specify their own proposed suppliers of active ingredients and special packaging materials in their applications  regulatory approval of a new supplier would be required if active ingredients or such packaging materials were no longer available from the supplier specified in the marketing approval 
the need to qualify a new supplier could delay the company development and commercialization efforts 
the company uses bovine derived serum sourced from new zealand and north america in the manufacturing process for elaprase 
the discovery of additional cattle in north america or the discovery of cattle in new zealand with bovine spongiform encephalopathy  or mad cow disease  could cause the regulatory agencies in some countries to impose restrictions on these products  or prohibit the company from using these products at all in such countries 
the actions of certain customers can affect the company ability to sell or market products profitably  as well as impact net sales and growth comparisons a small number of large wholesale distributors control a significant share of the us and certain european markets 
in  for example  of the company product sales were attributable to two customers in the us  mckesson corp 
and cardinal health  inc in the event of financial failure of any of these customers  the company may suffer financial loss and a decline in revenues and earnings 
in addition  the number of independent drug stores and small chains has decreased as retail pharmacy consolidation has occurred 
consolidation or financial difficulties could cause customers to reduce their inventory levels  or otherwise reduce purchases of the company products 
such actions could have an adverse effect on the company revenues  financial condition and results of operations 
a significant portion of the company s sp product sales are made to major pharmaceutical wholesale distributors as well as to large pharmacies in both the us and europe 
consequently  product sales and growth comparisons may be affected by fluctuations in the buying patterns of major distributors and other trade buyers 
these fluctuations may result from seasonality  pricing  wholesaler buying decisions  or other factors 

table of contents in addition  a significant portion of the company revenues for certain products for treatment of rare genetic diseases are concentrated with a small number of customers 
changes in the buying patterns of those customers may have an adverse effect on the company revenues  financial condition and results of operations 
investigations or enforcement action by regulatory authorities or law enforcement agencies relating to the company s activities in the highly regulated markets in which it operates may result in the distraction of senior management  significant legal costs and the payment of substantial compensation or fines the company engages in various marketing  promotional and educational activities pertaining to  as well as the sale of  pharmaceutical products in a number of jurisdictions around the world 
the promotion  marketing and sale of pharmaceutical products is highly regulated and the operations of market participants  such as the company  are closely supervised by regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies  including the us department of health and human services hhs  the fda  the us department of justice and the dea in the us 
any inquiries or investigations into the operations of  or enforcement or other regulatory action against  the company by such regulatory authorities could result in the distraction of senior management for prolonged periods of time  significant defence costs  substantial monetary penalties and require extensive government monitoring of company activities in the future 
as an example  on september  the company received a subpoena from the hhs office of inspector general in coordination with the us attorney for the eastern district of pennsylvania  seeking production of documents related to the sales and marketing of adderall xr  vyvanse and daytrana 
shire is cooperating and responding to this subpoena 
the outsourcing of services can create a significant dependency on third parties  the failure of whom can affect the ability to operate the company business and to develop and market products the company has entered into many agreements with third parties for the provision of services to enable it to operate its business 
if the third party can no longer provide the service on the agreed basis  the company may not be able to continue the development or commercialization of its products as planned or on a commercial basis 
additionally  it may not be able to establish or maintain good relationships with the suppliers 
the company has also entered into licensing and co development agreements with a number of parties 
there is a risk that  upon expiration or termination of a third party agreement  the company may not be able to renew or extend the agreement with the third party as commercial interests may no longer coincide 
in such circumstances  the company may be unable to continue to develop or market its products as planned and could be required to abandon or divest a product line 
risk factors related to the pharmaceutical industry in general the actions of governments  industry regulators and the economic environments in which the company operates may adversely affect its ability to develop and market its products profitably changes to laws or regulations impacting the pharmaceutical industry  in any country in which the company conducts its business  may adversely impact the company revenues  financial condition and results of operations 
in particular  changes to the regulations relating to orphan drug status may affect the exclusivity granted to products with such designation 
the introduction of new products by competitors may impact future revenues the manufacture and sale of pharmaceuticals is highly competitive 
many of the company competitors are large  well known pharmaceutical  biotechnology  chemical and healthcare companies with considerable resources 
companies with more resources and larger r d expenditures have a greater ability to fund clinical trials and other development work necessary for regulatory applications 
they may also be more successful than the company in acquiring or licensing new products for development and commercialization 
if any product that competes with one of the company principal drugs is approved  the company sales of that drug could fall 
the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are also characterized by continuous product development and technological change 
the company products could  therefore  be rendered obsolete or uneconomical  through the development of new products  technological advances in manufacturing or production by its competitors 

table of contents the successful development of pharmaceutical products is highly uncertain and requires significant expenditures and time products that appear promising in research or development may be delayed or fail to reach later stages of development or the market for several reasons  including preclinical or clinical tests may show the product to lack safety or efficacy  delays may be caused by slow enrollment in clinical studies  additional clinical supplies requirements  extended length of time to achieve study endpoints  additional time requirements for data analysis or dossier preparation  discussions with regulatory agencies  including regulatory agency requests for additional preclinical or clinical data  delays at regulatory agencies due to staffing or resource limitations  analysis of or changes to study design  unexpected safety  efficacy  or manufacturing issues 
delays may arise from shared control with collaborative partners in the planning and execution of the product development  scaling of the manufacturing process  or getting approval for manufacturing  manufacturing issues  pricing  reimbursement issues  or other factors may render the product economically unviable  the proprietary rights of others and their competing products and technologies may prevent the product from being developed or commercialized  and failure to receive necessary regulatory approvals 
success in preclinical and early clinical trials does not ensure that large scale clinical trials will be successful 
clinical results are frequently susceptible to varying interpretations that may delay  limit  or prevent regulatory approvals 
the length of time necessary to complete clinical trials and to submit an application for marketing approval for a final decision by a regulatory authority varies significantly and may be difficult to predict 
if the company s large scale or late state clinical trials for a product are not successful  the company will not recover its substantial investments in that product 
in addition  even if the products receive regulatory approval  they remain subject to ongoing regulatory requirements  including  for example  obligations to conduct additional clinical trials or other non clinical testing  changes to the product label  new or revised requirements for manufacturing  written notifications to physicians  or product recalls or withdrawals 
further  a number of the company s products that treat adhd contain controlled substances and are subject to regulation by the us dea and equivalent agencies in other countries 
the failure of a strategic partner to develop and commercialize products could result in delays in approval or loss of revenue the company enters into strategic partnerships with other companies in areas such as product development and sales and marketing 
in these partnerships  the company is sometimes dependent on its partner to deliver results 
while these partnerships are supported by contracts  the company may not exercise direct control 
if a partner fails to perform or experiences financial difficulties  the company may suffer a delay in the development  a delay in the approval or a reduction in sales or royalties of a product 
the failure to secure new products or compounds for development  either through in licensing  acquisition or internal research and development efforts  may have an adverse impact on the company future results the company future results will depend  to a significant extent  upon its ability to in license  acquire or develop new products or compounds 
the company also expends significant resources on research and development 
the failure to in license or acquire new products or compounds  on a commercially viable basis  could have a material adverse effect on the company revenues  financial condition and results of operations 
the failure of these efforts to result in the development of products appropriate for testing in human clinical trials could have a material adverse effect on the company revenues  financial condition and results of operations 
the company may fail to obtain  maintain  enforce or defend the intellectual property rights required to conduct its business the company success depends upon its ability and the ability of its partners and licensors to protect their intellectual property rights 
where possible  the company strategy is to register intellectual property rights  such as patents and trademarks 
the company also relies variously on trade secrets  unpatented know how and technological innovations and contractual arrangements with third parties to maintain its competitive position 
patents and patent applications covering a number of the technologies and processes owned or licensed to the company have been granted  or are pending in various countries  including the us  canada  major european countries and japan 

table of contents the company intends to enforce vigorously its patent rights and believes that its partners intend to enforce vigorously patent rights they have licensed to the company 
however  patent rights may not prevent other entities from developing  using or commercializing products that are similar or functionally equivalent to the company products or technologies 
the company patent rights may be successfully challenged in the future or laws providing such rights may be changed or withdrawn 
the company cannot assure investors that its patents and patent applications or those of its third party manufacturers will provide valid patent protection sufficiently broad to protect the company products and technology or that such patents will not be challenged  revoked  invalidated  infringed or circumvented by third parties 
in the regular course of business  the company is party to litigation or other proceedings relating to intellectual property rights 
see item legal proceedings and note  commitments and contingencies  legal proceedings to the consolidated financial statements set forth in this annual report on form k for details of current patent litigation 
additionally  the company products  or the technologies or processes used to formulate or manufacture those products may now  or in the future  infringe the patent rights of third parties 
it is also possible that third parties will obtain patent or other proprietary rights that might be necessary or useful for the development  manufacture or sale of the company products 
if third parties are the first to invent a particular product or technology  it is possible that those parties will obtain patent rights that will be sufficiently broad to prevent the company or its strategic partners from developing  manufacturing or selling its products 
the company may need to obtain licenses for intellectual property rights from others to develop  manufacture and market commercially viable products and may not be able to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
in addition  any licensed patents or proprietary rights may not be valid and enforceable 
the company also relies on trade secrets and other un patented proprietary information  which it generally seeks to protect by confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with its employees  consultants  advisors and partners 
these agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide the company with an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of such information 
if the company employees  scientific consultants or partners develop inventions or processes that may be applicable to the company products under development  such inventions and processes will not necessarily become the company property  but may remain the property of those persons or their employers 
protracted and costly litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of the company proprietary rights 
the failure to obtain or maintain patent and trade secret protection  for any reason  could allow other companies to make competing products and reduce the company product sales 
the company has filed applications to register various trademarks for use in connection with its products in various countries including the us and countries in europe and latin america and intends to trademark new product names as new products are developed 
in addition  with respect to certain products  the company relies on the trademarks of third parties 
these trademarks may not afford adequate protection or the company or the third parties may not have the financial resources to enforce any rights under any of these trademarks 
the company inability or the inability of these third parties to protect their trademarks because of successful third party claims to those trademarks could allow others to use the company trademarks and dilute their value 
if a marketed product fails to work effectively or causes adverse side effects  this could result in damage to the company reputation  the withdrawal of the product and legal action against the company unanticipated side effects or unfavorable publicity from complaints concerning any of the company products  or those of its competitors  could have an adverse effect on the company ability to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals or successfully market its products 
the testing  manufacturing  marketing and sales of pharmaceutical products entails a risk of product liability claims  product recalls  litigation and associated adverse publicity 
the cost of defending against such claims is expensive even when the claims are not merited 
a successful product liability claim against the company could require the company to pay a substantial monetary award 
if  in the absence of adequate insurance coverage  the company does not have sufficient financial resources to satisfy a liability resulting from such a claim or to fund the legal defense of such a claim  it could become insolvent 
product liability insurance coverage is expensive  difficult to obtain and may not be available in the future on acceptable terms 
although the company carries product liability insurance when available  this coverage may not be adequate 
in addition  it cannot be certain that insurance coverage for present or future products will be available 
moreover  an adverse judgment in a product liability suit  even if insured or eventually overturned on appeal  could generate substantial negative publicity about the company products and business and inhibit or prevent commercialization of other products 
loss of highly qualified management and scientific personnel could cause the company subsequent financial loss the company faces competition for highly qualified management and scientific personnel from other companies  academic institutions  government entities and other organizations 
it may not be able to successfully attract and retain such personnel 
the company has agreements with a number of its key scientific and management personnel for periods of one year or less 
the loss of such personnel  or the inability to attract and retain the additional  highly skilled employees required for its activities could have an adverse effect on the company business

income access share arrangements pursuant to the scheme of arrangement the scheme that became effective on may  shire plc became the holding company of the former holding company of the shire group  shire biopharmaceuticals holdings old shire 
as a result of the scheme  shire has put into place income access arrangements which enable shire ordinary shareholders  other than shire ads holders  to choose whether they receive their dividends from shire a company resident for tax purposes in the republic of ireland or from old shire  a shire group company resident for tax purposes in the uk 
old shire has issued one income access share to the income access trust the ias trust which is held by the trustee of the ias trust the trustee 
the mechanics of the arrangements are as follows i if a dividend is announced or declared by shire plc on its ordinary shares  an amount is paid by old shire by way of a dividend on the income access share to the trustee  and such amount is paid by the trustee to ordinary shareholders who have elected or are deemed to have elected to receive dividends under these arrangements 
the dividend which would otherwise be payable by shire plc to its ordinary shareholders will be reduced by an amount equal to the amount paid to its ordinary shareholders by the trustee 
ii if the dividend paid on the income access share and on paid by the trustee to ordinary shareholders is less than the total amount of the dividend announced or declared by shire plc on its ordinary shares  shire plc will be obliged to pay a dividend on the relevant ordinary shares equivalent to the amount of the shortfall 
in such a case  any dividend paid on the ordinary shares will generally be subject to irish withholding tax at the rate of or such lower rate as may be applicable under exemptions from withholding tax contained in irish law 
iii an ordinary shareholder is entitled to make an income access share election such that she he will receive his her dividends which would otherwise be payable by shire plc under these arrangements from old shire 
iv an ordinary shareholder who holds  or fewer ordinary shares at the first record date after s he first becomes an ordinary shareholder  and who does not make a contrary election  will be deemed to have made an election pursuant to the shire plc articles of association such that she he will receive his her dividends under these arrangements from old shire 
the ads depositary has made an election on behalf of all holders of adss such that they will receive dividends from old shire under the income access share arrangements 
dividends paid by old shire under the income access share arrangements will not  under current legislation  be subject to any uk or irish withholding taxes 
if a holder of adss does not wish to receive dividends from old shire under the income access share arrangements  she he must withdraw his her ordinary shares from the ads program prior to the dividend record date set by the depositary and request delivery of the shire plc ordinary shares 
this will enable him her to receive dividends from shire plc if necessary  by making an election to that effect 
it is the expectation  although there can be no certainty  that old shire will distribute dividends on the income access share to the trustee for the benefit of all ordinary shareholders who make or are deemed to make an income access share election in an amount equal to what would have been such ordinary shareholders entitlement to dividends from shire plc in the absence of the income access share election 
if any dividend paid on the income access share and or paid to the ordinary shareholders is less than such ordinary shareholders entitlement to dividends from shire plc in the absence of the income access share election  the dividend on the income access share will be allocated pro rata among the ordinary shareholders and shire plc will pay the balance to these ordinary shareholders by way of dividend 
in such circumstances  there will be no grossing up by shire plc in respect of  and old shire and shire plc will not compensate those ordinary shareholders for  any adverse consequences including any irish withholding tax consequences 

table of contents shire will be able to suspend or terminate these arrangements at any time  in which case the full shire plc dividend will be paid directly by shire plc to those ordinary shareholders including the depositary who have made or are deemed to have made an income access share election 
in such circumstances  there will be no grossing up by shire plc in respect of  and old shire and shire plc will not compensate those ordinary shareholders for  any adverse consequences including any irish withholding tax consequences 
in the year ended december  old shire paid dividends totaling million million  million on the income access share to the trustee in an amount equal to the dividend ordinary shareholders would have received from shire plc 
distributable reserves the payment of dividends by shire plc is governed by jersey law 
under jersey law  shire plc is entitled to make payments of dividends from its accumulated profits and other distributable reserves 
prior to making any dividend payment  the directors of shire plc who authorize the payment of the dividend must make a solvency statement to the effect that shire plc will be able to continue to carry on its business and discharge its debts as they fall due immediately after the payment is made and for the twelve month period following the making of the payment 
shire future dividend policy will be dependent upon the amount of its distributable reserves  its financial condition  the terms of its then existing debt facilities and other relevant factors existing at the time 
for dividends paid by old shire on the income access share to the trustee  the ability of old shire to pay dividends is determined under english law 
as a matter of english law old shire can only pay dividends out of its distributable profits  which are the accumulated realized profits of old shire and not the consolidated group  so far as not previously utilized by distribution or capitalization  less accumulated realized losses  so far as not previously written off in a reduction or reorganization of capital

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements contained in part iv in this annual report on form k 
overview shire s strategic goal is to be the leading specialty biopharmaceutical company in the world that focuses on meeting the needs of the specialist physician 
shire focuses its business on adhd  hgt and gi diseases  as well as opportunities in other specialty therapeutic areas to the extent they arise through acquisitions 
shire s in licensing  merger and acquisition efforts are focused on products in specialist markets with strong intellectual property protection and global rights 
shire believes that a carefully selected and balanced portfolio of products with strategically aligned and relatively small scale sales forces will deliver strong results 
substantially all of the company s revenues  expenditures and net assets are attributable to the r d  manufacture  sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products within two reportable segments sp and hgt 
the company also earns royalties where shire has out licensed products to third parties which are recorded as revenues 
revenues are derived primarily from two sources sales of the company s own products and royalties of total revenues are derived from product sales  of which are within sp and are within hgt  and of total revenues are derived from royalties 
shire s strategic objectives are set using a balanced scorecard approach 
strategic and operational objectives are set at the corporate level and cascaded to the segment sp hgt  therapeutic area and functional levels so that these objectives are aligned with the corporate objectives 
the company therefore takes a fully integrated approach to strategic management and uses key performance indicators kpis to measure the achievement of these objectives 
for  shire s corporate kpis included certain financial and non financial measures 
the markets in which the company conducts its business are highly competitive and highly regulated 
the health care industry is experiencing pressure from governments and healthcare providers to keep prices low while increasing access to drugs  increased r d costs  because development programs are typically larger and take longer to get approval from regulators  challenges to existing patents from generic manufacturers  governments and healthcare systems favoring earlier entry of low cost generic drugs  and higher marketing costs  due to increased competition for market share 
shire s strategy to become the leading specialty biopharmaceutical company has been developed to address these industry wide competitive pressures 
this strategy has resulted in a series of initiatives in the following areas markets historically  shire s portfolio of approved products has been heavily weighted towards the north american market 
the acquisition in of tkt and the consequent establishment of our hgt business  together with the acquisitions of jerini in which brought the hae product firazyr  equasym in which facilitated shire s immediate access to the european adhd market and movetis in which brought eu rights to resolor and further developed our gi pipeline  provided shire with the platforms to increase its presence in europe and the row  thereby working towards diversifying the risk associated with reliance on one geographic market 
in the sp and hgt businesses derived more than and  respectively  of their product sales from outside of the us 
shire has made significant progress on a path to geographic diversification with additional development and commercialization activities in  including continued roll out of mezavant  fosrenol and firazyr in europe  and the acquisition of movetis  which has added the approved product resolor to the company s european gi portfolio 
shire s long term mission is to increase the value of product sales from outside of the us and outside of us  uk  germany  france  italy  spain and canada 
shire has ongoing late stage development activities  which are expected to further supplement the diversification of revenues in the future  and include the following 
table of contents vyvanse launches in latin american countries and the registration program for approval in the eu  intuniv registration program for approval in the eu  the continued roll out of vpriv in certain eu and latin american countries  the continued roll out of firazyr in certain european and latin american countries  the lialda mezavant diverticulitis registration program  and the continued roll out of fosrenol  equasym and resolor in eu and row countries 
r d over the last five years shire has focused its r d efforts on products in its core therapeutic areas and concentrated its resources on obtaining regulatory approval for later stage pipeline products within these core therapeutic areas 
in addition to continued efforts in its late stage pipeline in core adhd  gi and hgt therapeutic areas  shire has also progressed work on an earlier stage pipeline 
evidence of the successful progression of the late stage pipeline can be seen from the granting of approval and associated launches of the company s products over the last six years 
since january  several products have received regulatory approval in the us  elaprase in  lialda and vyvanse in  intuniv in  and vpriv in  in the eu  fosrenol in  elaprase and mezavant in  and vpriv in  in canada  vyvanse in shire s strategy is focused on the development of product candidates that have a lower risk profile 
as shire further expanded its earlier phase pipeline  r d costs in included expenditure on several pre clinical to phase studies for products in development as well as phase b and phase studies to support recently launched products in the sp and hgt businesses  together with the development of new projects in both the sp and hgt businesses

patents and market exclusivity the loss or expiration of patent protection or regulatory exclusivity with respect to any of the company s major products could have a material adverse effect on the company s revenues  financial condition and results of operations  as generic manufacturers may enter the market 
generic manufacturers often do not need to complete extensive clinical studies when they seek registration of a copy product and accordingly  they are generally able to sell the company s drugs at a much lower price 
as expected  in teva and impax commenced commercial shipments of their authorized generic versions of adderall xr  leading to declines in sales of branded adderall xr in both and as discussed in item business  the fda has not yet reached a decision on the citizen petition for adderall xr which was filed in october an fda decision which does not require generic follow on products to require bio equivalence or additional clinical testing could lead to additional generic competition for adderall xr 
shire is engaged in various legal proceedings with generic manufacturers with respect to its vyvanse  intuniv replagal  fosrenol  lialda and adderall xr patents

business development as a result of the issues associated with the loss or expiry of patent protection or loss of data exclusivity  shire seeks to focus its business development activity on the acquisition and in licensing of products and projects which have the benefit of long term patent protection and or data exclusivity 
for example  through the acquisition of movetis in  shire obtained recently launched resolor  a promising gi pipeline and world class r d talent 
in shire also acquired an exclusive license in markets outside of north america for the actriib class of molecules being developed by acceleron 
the collaboration with acceleron will initially focus on further developing hgt also called ace for the treatment of patients with dmd

adderall xr adhd adderall xr product sales decreased due to lower us prescription demand following the launch of authorized generic versions in  which more than offset us adhd market growth and higher sales deductions in of branded gross sales in compared to in 
these factors more than offset the effects of stocking in compared to destocking in there are potentially different interpretations as to how shipments of authorized generic adderall xr to teva and impax should be included in the medicaid rebate calculation pursuant to medicaid rebate legislation  including the deficit reduction act of the medicaid rebate legislation 
as a result  more than one unit rebate amount ura is calculable for the purposes of determining the company s medicaid rebate liability to the states after authorized generic launch 
in the years to december  and  the company has recorded its accrual for medicaid rebates based on its best estimate of the rebate payable 
this best estimate is consistent with i the company s interpretation of the medicaid rebate legislation  as amended in by the relevant provisions of the affordable care act  ii the company s repeated and consistent submission of price reporting to the cms using the company s interpretation of the medicaid rebate legislation  iii cms calculating the ura based on that interpretation  iv states submitting medicaid rebate invoices using this ura  and v shire paying these invoices 
shire believes that its interpretation of the medicaid rebate legislation is reasonable and correct 
in addition  the affordable care act contained a provision  effective as of october   that provided further clarity  in a manner consistent with the company s interpretation  as to how shipments of authorized generics should be included in medicaid rebate calculations from october  forward 
cms has explicitly referred manufacturers with authorized generics to this new provision in making their branded rebate calculations  further supporting the company s interpretation 
however  cms could disagree with the company s interpretation for determining medicaid rebates payable for the period prior to october   require shire to apply an alternative interpretation of the medicaid rebate legislation and pay up to million above the recorded liability 
for rebates in respect of prescriptions rebates this would represent a ura substantially in excess of the unit sales price of adderall xr and accordingly in excess of the approximate amount of the full cost to the states of reimbursement for medicaid prescriptions of adderall xr 
for rebates in respect of prescriptions  as a result of provisions in the affordable care act  the ura would be limited to an amount approximating the unit sales price of adderall xr 
should cms require shire to apply an alternative interpretation of the medicaid rebate legislation for the period prior to october   shire could seek to limit any additional payment for rebates to a level approximating the full  un rebated cost to the states of adderall xr  or million above the recorded liability 
further  shire believes it has a strong legal basis supporting its interpretation of the medicaid rebate legislation  and that there would be a strong basis to initiate litigation to recover any amount paid in excess of the recorded liability 
the result of any such litigation cannot be predicted and could result in additional rebate liability above shire s current best estimate

revolving credit facilities agreement on november  the company entered into a committed multicurrency revolving and swingline facilities agreement with a number of financial institutions  for which abbey national treasury services plc trading as santander global banking and markets  bank of america securities limited  barclays capital  citigroup global markets limited  lloyds tsb bank plc and the royal bank of scotland plc acted as mandated lead arrangers and bookrunners the new rcf 
the new rcf is for an aggregate amount of  million and cancelled the company s existing committed revolving credit facility the old rcf 
the new rcf  which includes a million swingline facility  may be used for general corporate purposes and matures on november  the interest rate on each loan drawn under the new rcf for each interest period is the percentage rate per annum which is the aggregate of the applicable margin ranging from to per cent per annum and libor for the applicable currency and interest period 
shire also pays a commitment fee on undrawn amounts at per cent per annum of the applicable margin 
under the new rcf it is required that i shire s ratio of net debt to ebitda as defined within the new rcf agreement does not exceed to for either the month period ending december or june unless shire has exercised its option which is subject to certain conditions to increase it to to for two consecutive testing dates  ii the ratio of ebitda to net interest as defined in the new rcf agreement must not be less than to  for either the month period ending december or june  and iii additional limitations on the creation of liens  disposal of assets  incurrence of indebtedness  making of loans  giving of guarantees and granting security over assets

financing shire anticipates that its operating cash flow together with available cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and the new rcf will be sufficient to meet its anticipated future operating expenses  capital expenditures  tax and interest payments and lease obligations as they become due over the next twelve months 
if the company decides to acquire other businesses  it expects to fund these acquisitions from existing cash resources  the new rcf and possibly through new borrowings and the issue of new equity if necessary 
sources and uses of cash the following table provides an analysis of the company s gross and net debt excluding restricted cash  as at december  and december  m m cash and cash equivalents shire convertible bonds building financing obligation total debt net debt 
table of contents cash flow activity net cash provided by operating activities for the year to december  increased by million to million million  primarily due to higher cash receipts from product sales and royalties  cash inflows from forward foreign exchange contracts in compared to outflows in  partially offset by higher payments on sales deductions  operating costs and taxes in the year to december  compared to the same period in net cash provided by operating activities for the year to december  decreased by to million compared to million for the year to december   a decrease of million 
net cash provided by operating activities was lower in compared to due to lower net sales receipts and higher cash tax payments in compared to net cash provided by operating activities in also included cash inflows on forward foreign exchange contracts which were not repeated in these factors more than offset the inclusion of interest paid on settlement of the tkt appraisal rights in cash flow from operating activities in net cash used in investing activities was million in the year to december  this included the cash paid net of cash acquired of million for  and payments of million on foreign exchange contracts related to  the acquisition of movetis in october  and expenditure on property  plant and equipment of million 
capital expenditure on property  plant and equipment includes million for the acquisition of new properties and properties previously occupied under operating leases and million on construction work  at lexington technology park 
net cash used in investing activities was million in the year to december  this included the cash cost of purchasing equasym of million and expenditure on property  plant and equipment of million 
these cash outflows were partially offset by receipts of million from the sale of non current investments 
capital expenditure on property  plant and equipment included million on construction work at the hgt campus in lexington  massachusetts  million on construction work at the uk office in basingstoke  hampshire  and million on infrastructure and capital management projects in the us 
this capital expenditure was funded from the company s existing cash resources and operating cash flows 
net cash used in financing activities was million for the year to december   including the dividend payment of million and million to extinguish building finance obligations at lexington technology park 
net cash used in financing activities was million for the year to december  which relates to million for the dividend payment partially offset by excess tax benefits of stock based compensation of million and proceeds from exercise of options of million 
outstanding letters of credit at december   the company had irrevocable standby letters of credit and guarantees with various banks totaling million  providing security for the company s performance of various obligations 
these obligations are primarily in respect of the recoverability of insurance claims  lease obligations and supply commitments 
the company has restricted cash of million  as required by these letters of credit 
cash requirements at december  the company s cash requirements for long term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet and other contractual obligations were as follows payments due by period less than more than total year years years years m m m m m long term debt obligations i operating leases obligation ii purchase obligations iii other long term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet iv total 
table of contents i shire s  million principal amount of convertible bonds due issued in may and the interest on the convertible bonds has been included based on the contractual payment dates 
the principal amount of  million has been included within payments due in three to five years based on the final maturity date of the convertible bonds 
the bondholders have the option to redeem the convertible bonds at the principal amount in may and the company has the option to call the bonds subject to certain conditions after may further details are included within liquidity and capital resources shire convertible bonds due above 
ii the company leases certain land  facilities  motor vehicles and certain equipment under operating leases expiring through iii purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods  investments or services including clinical trials  contract manufacturing and capital equipment that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including open purchase orders 
shire expects to fund these commitments with cash flows from operating activities 
iv unrecognized tax benefits and associated interest and penalties of million and million are included within payments due in less than one year and payments due in one to three years  respectively 
the contractual obligations table above does not include certain milestones and other contractual commitments where payment is contingent upon the occurrence of events which are yet to occur and therefore payment is not yet due 
the most significant of the company s milestone and contractual commitments which are contingent on the occurrence of future events are as follows i collaboration with acceleron for actriib class of molecules on september  shire announced that it had expanded its hgt pipeline by acquiring an exclusive license in markets outside of north america for the actriib class of molecules being developed by acceleron 
the collaboration will initially focus on further developing ace  the lead actriib drug candidate  which is in development for the treatment of patients with dmd 
the phase a trial is on hold and clinical safety is under review 
ace and the other actriib class of molecules have the potential to be used in other muscular and neuromuscular disorders with high unmet medical need 
in the year to december  shire made an upfront payment of million to acceleron which has been expensed to r d 
shire will pay acceleron up to a further million  subject to certain development  regulatory and sales milestones being met for ace in dmd  up to an additional million for successful commercialization of other indications and molecules  and royalties on product sales 
shire and acceleron will conduct the collaboration through a joint steering committee  with subcommittees including a joint manufacture committee  and a joint patent committee to monitor the development of ace and other compounds 
ii research collaboration with santaris on locked nucleic acid lna drug platform on august  shire announced that it had entered into a research collaboration with santaris  to develop its proprietary lna technology in a range of rare diseases 
lna technology has the benefit of shortened target validation and proof of concept  potentially increasing the speed and lowering the cost of development 
as part of the joint research project santaris will design  develop and deliver pre clinical lna oligonucleotides for shire selected orphan disease targets  and shire will have the exclusive right to further develop and commercialize these candidate compounds on a worldwide basis 
in the year to december  shire made an upfront payment of million to santaris  for technology access and r d funding  which has been expensed to r d 
in the year to december  shire paid success milestones of million 
shire has remaining obligations to pay santaris a further million subject to certain success criteria  and development and sales milestones up to a maximum of million for each indication 
shire will also pay single or double digit tiered royalties on net sales of the product 
shire and santaris have formed a joint research committee to monitor r d activities through preclinical lead candidate selection at which point all development and commercialization costs will be the responsibility of shire 
iii juvista on june  shire signed an agreement with renovo to develop and commercialize juvista  renovo s novel drug candidate being investigated for the reduction of scarring in connection with surgery  outside of the eu 
on march  the license agreement was revised 

table of contents in the revised license agreement  the rights to sell juvista in all territories outside the us  mexico and canada were returned to renovo 
milestone and royalty obligations remain unchanged from the original agreement except that shire will pay renovo an additional million milestone if shire elects to commence a clinical trial following shire s review of the clinical trial report from renovo s first eu phase clinical trial 
on february   renovo announced its phase trial for juvista in scar revision surgery did not meet its primary or secondary endpoints 
shire is currently considering the trial data and whether to exercise its rights to terminate the license agreement 
shire has remaining obligations to pay renovo million on the filing of juvista with the fda  up to million on fda approval  royalties on net sales of juvista  and up to million on the achievement of very significant sales targets 
under the revised agreement  each party is responsible for its own development costs but future development costs can be shared by agreement 
each party has free of charge access to the other party s data to support regulatory filings in their respective territories 
in the year to december  shire made a payment to renovo of million million  million  being the final payment under the terms of the original license agreement  which has been charged by shire to r d 
off balance sheet arrangements there are no off balance sheet arrangements aside from the milestone payments mentioned above that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future effect on the company s financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors 
foreign currency fluctuations a number of the company s subsidiaries have functional currencies other than the us dollar 
as such  the consolidated financial results are subject to fluctuations in exchange rates  particularly those between the us dollar  canadian dollar  pounds sterling and the euro 
the accumulated foreign currency translation differences at december  of million are reported within accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheet and foreign exchange gains for the year to december  of million are reported in the consolidated statements of income 
at december   the company had outstanding swap and forward foreign exchange contracts to manage the currency risk associated with intercompany transactions 
for further information  see item a in this annual report on form k 
at december  the fair value of these contracts was a net asset of million 
concentration of credit risk financial instruments that potentially expose shire to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of short term cash investments  trade accounts receivable from product sales and from third parties from which the company receives royalties and derivative contracts 
cash is invested in short term money market instruments  including money market and liquidity funds and bank term deposits 
the money market and liquidity funds in which shire invests are all triple a rated by both standard and poor s and by moody s credit rating agencies 
the company is exposed to the credit risk of the counterparties with which it enters into derivative instruments 
the company limits this exposure through a system of internal credit limits which require counterparties to have a long term credit rating of a a or better from the major rating agencies 
the internal credit limits are approved by the board and exposure against these limits is monitored by the corporate treasury function 
the counterparties to these derivatives contracts are major international financial institutions 
the company s revenues from product sales are mainly governed by agreements with major pharmaceutical wholesalers and relationships with other pharmaceutical distributors and retail pharmacy chains 
for the year to december  there were two customers in the us who accounted for of the company s product sales 
however  such customers typically have significant cash resources and as such the risk from concentration of credit is considered minimal 
the company has taken positive steps to manage any credit risk associated with these transactions and operates clearly defined credit evaluation procedures 
inflation although at reduced levels in recent years  inflation continues to apply upward pressure on the cost of goods and services which are used in the business 
however  the company believes that the net effect of inflation on its revenues and operations has been minimal during the past three years 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements  in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap and sec regulations  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect 
table of contents the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ  potentially significantly  from amounts recorded based on the company s estimates and assumptions 
estimates and assumptions are primarily made in relation to the valuation of intangible assets  the valuation of equity investments  sales deductions  income taxes  provisions for litigation and contingent consideration receivable from product divestments 
i valuation of intangible assets a estimation of intangible asset amortization charges and impairment losses at december  the carrying value of the company s intangible assets was  million  primarily comprising the following currently marketed products or products under development firazyr million  replagal million  resolor million  and vyvanse million 
the company s intangible assets are comprised of i finite lived intangible assets which are amortized over their estimated useful life  principally for currently marketed products with a defined revenue stream  and ii indefinite lived ipr d assets which are either subject to amortization following completion  or impairment on abandonment  of the relevant development project  ipr d assets relate to development projects acquired through business combinations which closed subsequent to january  
management s estimate of the useful life of its intangible assets considers  inter alia  the following factors the expected use of the asset by the company  any legal  regulatory  or contractual provisions that may limit or extend the useful life  the effects of demand and competition  including the launch of generic products  and other general economic and or industry specific factors such as the stability of the industry  known technological advances  legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment  and expected changes in distribution channels 
the company reviews the useful life of its intangible assets subject to amortization at each reporting period  and revises its estimate of the useful life if warranted by events or circumstances 
any future changes to the useful life of the company s intangible assets could result in higher or lower amortization charges in future periods  which could materially affect the company s operating results 
the company reviews its finite lived intangible assets for impairment using a two step approach  whenever events or circumstances suggest that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
under step one  if the undiscounted cash flows resulting from the use and ultimate disposition of the finite lived intangible asset are less than its carrying value  the intangible asset is considered impaired 
the impairment loss is determined under step two as the amount by which the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value 
the company reviews its indefinite lived intangible assets principally relating to ipr d assets for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
indefinite lived assets are reviewed for impairment using a one step approach  which compares the fair value of the indefinite lived asset with its carrying amount 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the intangible asset 
events or circumstances that could suggest that the company s intangible assets may not be recoverable  and which would lead to an evaluation of the relevant asset for impairment  include but are not limited to the following changes to a product s commercialization strategy  the loss of patent protection  regulatory exclusivity or challenge or circumvention by competitors of the company s regulatory exclusivity patents  the development and marketing of competitive products  including generic entrants into the marketplace  changes to the product labels  or other regulatory intervention  sustained government pressure on prices and  specifically  competitive pricing  the occurrence of significant adverse events in respect to the company s products  a significant deterioration in a product s operating performance compared to expectations  an expectation that the intangible asset will be divested before the end of its previously estimated useful life  and 
table of contents adverse changes to the technological or commercial viability of development projects which the company s ipr d assets represent  which could include abandonment of the relevant project 
the occurrence of any such events or circumstance could adversely affect the company s estimates of the future net cash flows generated by its intangible assets 
after the identification of such events  circumstances  and the resultant impairment reviews  the company recognized intangible asset impairment losses of million in the year to december  which related to its daytrana intangible asset as a result of divestment to noven nil  million  of which million related to dynepo which the company stopped commercializing 
dependent on future events or circumstances  the company s operating results could be materially and adversely affected by future impairment losses relating to its intangible assets 
b intangible assets acquired through business combinations the fair values of all identifiable intangible assets for commercialized products acquired through business combinations primarily the acquisitions of tkt in  new river in  jerini in and movetis in have been determined using an income approach on a project by project basis using the multi period excess earnings method 
this method starts with a forecast of all expected future net cash flows which a market participant could have either generated or saved as a result of ownership of the intellectual property  customer relationships and other intangible assets 
these cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying a market participant discount rate that reflects the risk factors that a market participant would associate with the cash flows to the extent the underlying cash flows have not similarly been risk adjusted 
the forecast of future cash flows requires various assumptions to be made  including revenue that is reasonably likely to result from the sale of products including the estimated number of units to be sold  estimated selling prices  estimated market penetration and estimated market share and year over year growth rates over the product life cycles  royalty or license fees saved by owning the intellectual property associated with the products  cost of sales for the products using historical data  industry data or other sources of market data  sales and marketing expense using historical data  industry data or other sources of market data  general and administrative expenses  r d expenses  the estimated life of the products  and the tax amortization benefit available to a market participant purchasing the relevant assets outside of a business combination 
the valuations are based on information at the time of the acquisition of the identifiable intangible assets  and the expectations and assumptions that i have been deemed reasonable by the company s management and ii are based on information  expectations and assumptions that would be available to and made by a market participant 
no assurance can be given  however  that the underlying assumptions or events associated with such assets will occur as projected 
for these reasons  among others  the actual cash flows may vary from forecasts of future cash flows  and dependent on the outcome of future events or circumstances impairment losses as outlined at a above may result 
c ipr d acquired through business combinations ipr d represents the fair value assigned to incomplete technologies and development projects that the company has acquired through business combinations or asset acquisitions  which at the date of the relevant acquisition have not reached technological feasibility or have no alternative future use 
prior to january  the fair value ascribed to such technologies or development projects was immediately expensed to the consolidated statements of income in the year of acquisition 
the company recorded ipr d expense on the following significant business combinations that closed prior to january  million on acquisition of jerini in   million for new river in and million for tkt in in the company also recorded ipr d expense of million following the asset acquisition of metazym from zymenex 
additionally  non refundable fees paid on the in licensing of products that have not yet received regulatory approval and have no alternative future use have been expensed and presented within r d 
ipr d for business combinations that closed subsequent to january  is recorded as an indefinite lived intangible asset 
the company recorded indefinite lived ipr d assets of million on acquisition of movetis in  and million on acquisition of equasym from ucb in 
table of contents the company considers that a technology or development project has an alternative future use if it is probable that the company will use the asset in its current  incomplete state as it existed at the acquisition date  the asset will be used in another development project that has not yet commenced  and future economic benefit is expected from that use 
the company has determined that historically all such acquired development projects did not have an alternative future use 
the fair value of ipr d assets is determined using the income approach on a project by project basis using the multi period excess earnings method 
the fair value of the acquired ipr d assets has been based on the present value of probability adjusted incremental cash flows which a market participant would expect to be generated by the ipr d projects after the deduction of contributory asset charges for other assets employed in these projects 
this method incorporates an evaluation of the risks associated with the development project  which include applying an appropriate discount rate commensurate with the project stage of completion  the nature of the product  the scientific data associated with the technology  the current patent situation and market competition 
the forecast of future cash flows required the following assumptions to be made revenue that is likely to result from specific ipr d projects  including the likelihood of approval of the product  estimated number of units to be sold  estimated selling prices  estimated market penetration  estimated market share and year over year growth rates over the product life cycles  cost of sales related to the potential products using historical data  industry data or other sources of market data  sales and marketing expense using historical data  industry data or other market data  general and administrative expenses  r d expenses to complete the development of the acquired products  and the tax amortization benefit available to a market participant purchasing the relevant assets outside of a business combination 
the major risks and uncertainties associated with the timely completion of the acquired ipr d projects consist of the ability to confirm the safety and efficacy of the technology based on the data from ongoing clinical trials  and obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals 
the use of different estimates and assumptions to those used by the company could result in a materially different valuation of ipr d 
however  as the valuation process for ipr d involves a number of inter relating assumptions  the company does not consider it meaningful to quantify the sensitivity of the valuation of ipr d to changes in any individual assumption 
the valuation of ipr d has been based on information that existed at the time of the acquisition of the relevant development project  and utilized expectations and assumptions that i have been deemed reasonable by shire s management  and ii are based on information  expectations and assumptions that would be available to and made by a market participant 
however  no assurance can be given that the underlying assumptions or estimates associated with the valuation of ipr d will occur as projected 
if certain of the ipr d projects fail during development  are abandoned  or do not receive the relevant regulatory approvals  the company may not realize the future cash flows that it has estimated nor recover the value of the r d investment made subsequent to acquisition of the relevant project 
if such circumstances occur  the company s future operating results could be materially adversely impacted 
ii valuation of equity investments at december  the carrying value of the company s investments in certain public and private pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies amounted to million  principally represented by the company s available for sale investment in vertex 
the carrying values of these investments are periodically reviewed for other than temporary impairment  at least quarterly or more frequently if certain events or circumstances suggest that the carrying value of an investment exceeds its fair value 
indicators of other than temporary impairment which are considered by the company  include the market value of a quoted investment being below the cost of the investment  adverse news on a company s progress in scientific technology development of compounds  and recent stock issuances at a price below the investment price 
if the fair value appears to be below the investment s cost the company considers all available evidence in assessing whether there is an other than temporary impairment 
this evidence would include  but is not limited to the length of time and or the extent to which the market value of the investee is less than the cost of the investment  the level of progress in the investee s scientific technology development of compounds  ongoing activity in collaborations with the investee  
table of contents whether or not other substantial investee specific adverse events have occurred which may cause a decline in value  analysis and valuation of comparable companies  and the overall financial condition and near term prospects of the investee  including its ability to obtain financing to progress development of its compounds 
in instances when this review indicates that there is an other than temporary impairment of the company s investment in private companies  the company records an other than temporary impairment loss to record the investment at its then current fair value 
for the company s investments in public companies which are accounted for as available for sale securities  if these investments are deemed to be other than temporarily impaired  any unrealized holding loss is reclassified from other comprehensive income by recording an other than temporary impairment charge in the consolidated statements of income 
during  and shire did not record any impairment charges for its non current investments in private companies 
during the year to december   the company recorded other than temporary impairment charges of million for its available for sale securities  million  million 
at december  the company has net unrealized holding gains of million net of taxes on its available for sale securities and has one available for sale security in an unrealized holding loss position million at december  
other than temporary impairment charges of million recorded in included million for the company s investment in renovo group plc 
during the third quarter of  the company considered the following factors in its determination of whether its impairment in renovo group plc was temporary or other than temporary the severity of the decline from historical cost decline and its duration eleven months  market analysts targets of renovo group plc s share price for the next months  and the revised expected filing date for juvista due to the adoption of a sequential rather than parallel phase development plan 
these factors  together with the significant decline in global equity markets during the third quarter of meant that the company was unable to reasonably estimate the period over which a full recovery in the value of its investment in renovo group plc could occur 
as such  at the end of the third quarter of the company concluded that the decline in value was other than temporary 
the determination of the fair value of private company investments and the determination of whether an unrealized holding loss on a publicly quoted investment is other than temporary requires significant management judgment 
any future events or circumstances which could lead to the recognition of other than temporary impairment charges  particularly in respect of the company s investment in vertex carrying value at december  million  could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
iii sales deductions sales deductions consist of statutory rebates to state medicaid and other government agencies  contractual rebates with health maintenance organizations hmos  product returns  sales discounts including trade discounts and distribution service fees  wholesaler chargebacks  and allowances for coupon sampling programs 
these deductions are recorded as reductions to revenue in the same period as the related sales with estimates of future utilization derived from historical experience adjusted to reflect known changes in the factors that impact such reserves 
on the balance sheet the company records wholesaler chargebacks and prompt payment discounts as a reserve against accounts receivable  whereas all other sales deductions are recorded within current liabilities 
the company has the following significant categories of sales deductions  all of which involve estimates and judgments which the company considers to be critical accounting estimates  and require the company to use information from external sources medicaid and managed care rebates statutory rebates to state medicaid agencies and contractual rebates to managed care organizations mco under managed care programs are based on statutory or negotiated discounts to the selling price 
medicaid rebates generally increase as a percentage of the selling price over the life of the product if prices increase faster than inflation 
as it can take up to six months for information to reach the company on actual usage of the company s products in managed care and medicaid programs and on the total rebates to be reimbursed  the company maintains reserves for amounts payable under these programs relating to sold products 
the amount of the reserve is based on historical experience of rebates  the timing of payments  the level of reimbursement claims  changes in prices both normal selling prices and statutory or negotiated prices  changes in prescription demand patterns  projected product returns and the levels of inventory in the distribution channel 
adjustments are made for known changes in these factors  such as how shipments of authorized generic adderall xr to teva and impax should be included in the medicaid rebate calculation pursuant to medicaid rebate legislation 

table of contents shire s estimates of the level of inventory in the distribution channel are based on product by product inventory data provided by wholesalers  results of independently commissioned retail inventory surveys and third party prescription data such as ims health national prescription audit data 
revisions or clarification of guidelines from the cms related to state medicaid and other government program reimbursement practices with retroactive application can result in changes to management s estimates of the rebates reported in prior periods 
the accrual estimation process for medicaid and managed care rebates involves in each case a number of interrelating assumptions  which vary for each combination of product and medicaid agency or mco 
accordingly it would not be meaningful to quantify the sensitivity to change for any individual assumption or uncertainty 
however  with the exception of the estimation of the medicaid ura for adderall xr for the period prior to october  see below  shire does not believe that the effect of these uncertainties  taken as a whole  significantly impacts the company s financial condition or results of operations 
there are potentially different interpretations as to how shipments of authorized generic adderall xr to teva and impax should be included in the medicaid rebate calculation pursuant to medicaid rebate legislation 
as a result  more than one ura is calculable for the purposes of determining the company s medicaid rebate liability to the states after authorized generic launch 
in the years to december  and the company has recorded its accrual for adderall xr medicaid rebates based on its best estimate of the rebate payable 
this best estimate is consistent with i the company s interpretation of the medicaid rebate legislation as amended in by the relevant provisions of the affordable care act  ii the company s repeated and consistent submission of price reporting to the cms using the company s interpretation of the medicaid rebate legislation  iii cms calculating the ura based on that interpretation  iv states submitting medicaid rebate invoices using this ura  and v shire paying these invoices 
shire believes that its interpretation of the medicaid rebate legislation is reasonable and correct 
in addition  the affordable care act contained a provision  effective as of october   that provided further clarity  in a manner consistent with the company s interpretation  as to how shipments of authorized generics should be included in medicaid rebate calculations from october  forward 
cms has explicitly referred manufacturers with authorized generics to this new provision in making their branded rebate calculations  further supporting the company s interpretation 
however  cms could disagree with the company s interpretation  require shire to apply an alternative interpretation of the medicaid rebate legislation for the period prior to october  and pay up to million above the recorded liability 
for rebates this would represent a ura substantially in excess of the unit sales price of adderall xr and accordingly in excess of the approximate amount of the full cost to the states of reimbursement for medicaid prescriptions of adderall xr 
for rebates in respect of prescriptions  as a result of provisions in the affordable care act  the ura would be limited to an amount approximating the unit sales price of adderall xr 
should cms require shire to apply an alternative interpretation of the medicaid rebate legislation for the period prior to october   shire could seek to limit any additional payments for rebates to a level approximating the full  un rebated cost to the states of adderall xr  or million above the recorded liability 
further  shire believes it has a strong legal basis supporting its interpretation of the medicaid rebate legislation  and that there would be a strong basis to initiate litigation to recover any amount paid in excess of the recorded liability 
the result of any such litigation cannot be predicted and could result in additional rebate liability above shire s current best estimate 
any future change in the company s best estimate of the adderall xr medicaid rebate liability for the period prior to october  could significantly decrease reported adderall xr net product sales and impact the company s financial condition and results of operations in the period in which any such change of estimate were to occur 
aggregate accruals for medicaid and mco rebates at december   and were million million and million  or  and of net product sales 
historically  actual rebates have not varied significantly from the reserves provided 
product returns the company typically accepts customer product returns in the following circumstances a expiration of shelf life  b product damaged while in the possession of shire  c under sales terms that allow for unconditional return guaranteed sales  or d following product recalls or product withdrawals 
returns are generally accepted up to one year after expiration date of the relevant product 
the company typically refunds the agreed proportion of the sales price by the issuance of a credit  rather than cash refund or exchanges from inventory  and the returned product is destroyed 
shire estimates the proportion of recorded revenue that will result in a return by considering relevant factors  including past product returns activity  the duration of time taken for products to be returned  the estimated level of inventory in the distribution channel  
table of contents product recalls and discontinuances  the shelf life of products  the launch of new drugs or new formulations  and the loss of patent protection or new competition 
shire s estimate of the level of inventory in the distribution channel is based on product by product inventory data provided by wholesalers  third party prescription data and  for some product return provisions  market research of retail pharmacies 
returns reserves for new products generally require a higher level of estimation than estimates for established products 
for shipments made to support the commercial launch of a new product which can include guaranteed sales the company s policy is to defer recognition of the sales revenue until there is evidence of end patient acceptance of the new product primarily through third party prescription data 
for shipments after launch under standard terms ie not guaranteed sales  the company s initial estimates of sales return accruals are primarily based on the historical sales returns experience of similar products shortly after launch 
once sufficient historical data on actual returns of the product are available  the returns provision is based on this data and any other relevant factors as noted above 
the accrual estimation process for product returns involves in each case a number of interrelating assumptions  which vary for each combination of product and customer 
accordingly  it would not be meaningful to quantify the sensitivity to change for any individual assumption or uncertainty 
however  shire does not believe that the effect of uncertainties  as a whole  significantly impacts the company s financial condition or results of operations 
at december   and  provisions for product returns were million  million and million or  and respectively  of net product sales 
historically  actual returns have not varied significantly from the reserves provided 
iv income taxes in accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  management is required to develop estimates as to whether a tax benefit should be recognized in the consolidated financial statements  based on whether it is more likely than not that the technical merits of the position will be sustained based on audit by the tax authorities 
the measurement of the tax benefit recognized in the consolidated financial statements is based upon the largest amount of tax benefit that  in management s judgment  is greater than likely to be realized based on a cumulative probability assessment of the possible outcomes 
in accounting for income tax uncertainties  management is required to make judgments in the determination of the unit of account  the evaluation of the facts  circumstances and information in respect of the tax position taken  together with the estimates of amounts that the company may be required to pay in ultimate settlement with the tax authority 
shire operates in numerous countries where its income tax returns are subject to audit and adjustment by local tax authorities 
as shire operates globally  the nature of the uncertain tax positions is often very complex and subject to change and the amounts at issue can be substantial 
shire develops its cumulative probability assessment to measure uncertain tax positions using internal expertise  experience and judgment  together with the assistance from professional advisors 
original estimates are refined as additional information becomes known 
for example  in the year to december  the company recognized additional provisions in relation to ongoing compliance management for prior years totaling million 
these increases were partially off set by million primarily following conclusion of ongoing audits 
in the year to december  the company recognized additional interest expense of million on its provision for uncertain tax positions following the receipt of new information on the amount of interest that may be payable upon settlement of the relevant tax position 
any outcome upon settlement that differs from the recorded provision for uncertain tax positions may result in a materially higher or lower tax expense in future periods  which could significantly impact the company s results of operations or financial condition 
however  we do not believe it possible to reasonably estimate the potential impact of any such change in assumptions  estimates or judgments and the resultant change  if any  in the company s provision for uncertain tax positions  as any such change is dependent on factors such as future changes in tax law or administrative practice  the amount and nature of additional taxes which may be asserted by the taxation authorities  and the willingness of the relevant tax authorities to negotiate a settlement to any such position 
at december  the company recognized a liability of million for total unrecognized tax benefits million and had accrued million million for the payment of interest and penalties 
the company is required in certain tax jurisdictions to make advance deposits to tax authorities on receipt of a tax assessment 
these payments are offset against the income tax liability but do not reduce the provision for unrecognized tax benefits 

table of contents the company has significant deferred tax assets due to various tax attributes including  net operating losses nols  tax credits from research and development  investment tax credits and alternative minimum tax principally in the republic of ireland  the us  belgium  germany and the uk 
the realization of these assets is not assured and is dependent on the generation of sufficient taxable income in future periods 
management is required to exercise judgment in determining whether it is more likely than not that it would realize these deferred tax assets  based upon estimates of future taxable income and the availability of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in the various jurisdictions in which these nols and other tax attributes exist 
where there is an expectation that on the balance of probabilities there will not be sufficient taxable profits to utilize these tax attributes a valuation allowance is held against these deferred tax assets 
if actual events differ from management s estimates  or to the extent that these estimates are adjusted in the future  any changes to the valuation allowance could significantly impact the company s financial condition and results of operations 
at december  the company had deferred tax liabilities of million and gross deferred tax assets of million  against which the company had recorded valuation allowances of million 
at december  the company had deferred tax liabilities of million and gross deferred tax assets of million  against which the company had recorded valuation allowances of million

v litigation and legal proceedings the company has a number of lawsuits pending that relate to intellectual property infringement claims  and in september the company received a subpoena from the us department of health and human services office of the inspector general seeking production of documents related to the sales and marketing of adderall xr  daytrana and vyvanse  see item legal proceedings and note  commitments and contingencies  legal proceedings to the consolidated financial statements set forth in this annual report on form k for further details 
shire records a loss contingency provision for probable losses when management is able to reasonably estimate the loss 
where the estimated loss lies within a range  management records a loss contingency provision based on its best estimate of the probable loss 
where no particular amount within that range is a better estimate than any other amount  the minimum amount is recorded 
these estimates are often developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known  so estimates are refined each accounting period  as additional information becomes known 
best estimates are reviewed quarterly and estimates are changed when expectations are revised 
any outcome upon settlement that deviates from shire s best estimate may result in an additional or lesser expense in a future accounting period  which could materially impact the company s financial condition and results of operations 
on november  the company announced that it had successfully settled all aspects of the tkt appraisal rights litigation with all parties 
shire paid the same price of per share originally offered to all tkt shareholders at the time of the july merger  plus interest 
the settlement represents a total payment of million  representing consideration at per share of million and an interest cost of million 
prior to reaching this settlement  the company accrued interest based on a reasonable estimate of the amount that may be awarded by the court to those former tkt shareholders who requested appraisal 
this estimate of interest was based on shire s cost of borrowing 
between the close of the merger and november  the company applied this interest rate on a quarterly compounding basis to the million of consideration to calculate its provision for interest 
upon reaching agreement in principle with all the dissenting shareholders  the company determined that settlement had become the probable manner through which the appraisal rights litigation would be resolved 
under current law  although not applicable in this case because the merger was entered into before the relevant amendment to the law became effective the court presumptively awards interest in appraisal rights cases at a statutory rate that is percentage points above the federal reserve discount rate as it varies over the duration of the case 
in connection with the settlement  the company agreed to an interest rate that approximates to this statutory rate 
based on the settlement  the company amended the method of determining its interest provision to reflect this revised manner of resolution  and recorded additional interest expense of million in its consolidated financial statements for the year to december  on reaching settlement with the dissenting shareholders 
vi contingent consideration receivable from product divestments consideration receivable by the company on the divestment of product rights typically includes up front receipts and or milestones and royalties which are contingent on the outcome of future events  for example based upon the future sales performance of the divested product 
contingent consideration occasionally represents a significant proportion of the economic value receivable by the company for a divested product in these situations the company initially recognizes this contingent consideration as an asset at its divestment date fair value  with re measurement of this asset to its then current fair value at subsequent balance sheet dates 

table of contents at december  the company has contingent consideration assets of million nil  related to the divestment of daytrana to noven in october estimation of the fair value of this contingent consideration asset relies predominantly upon unobservable  level inputs including future sales of the divested product with estimates of future anticipated pricing  market share and market growth  relevant contractual royalty rates  an appropriate discount rate  and assumed weightings applied to potential scenarios in deriving a probability weighted fair value 
significant judgment is employed by the company in developing these estimates and assumptions  both at the date of divestment and in subsequent periods 
if actual events differ from management s estimates  or to the extent that these estimates are adjusted in the future  the company s financial condition and results of operations could be affected in the period of any such change of estimate
