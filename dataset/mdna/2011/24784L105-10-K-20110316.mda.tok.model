company overview we are a leading provider of enterprise software and information solutions designed and developed specifically for project focused organizations  including professional services firms  government contractors and government agencies 
more than  organizations and million users in approximately countries around the world rely on deltek to research and identify opportunities  win new business  optimize resources  streamline operations  and deliver profitable projects 
using deltek  our customers know more and do more 
in july  we acquired maconomy a s maconomy  an international provider of software solutions to professional services firms 
in october  we acquired input  inc input  which enables companies to identify and develop new business opportunities with federal  state and local governments and other public sector organizations 
in november  we extended and expanded our existing credit facility 
the extended credit facility provides for million in aggregate borrowings  consisting of million in term loans maturing in november and a million revolving credit facility maturing in our revenue is generated from sales of software licenses and related software maintenance and support  professional services to assist customers with the implementation of our products  as well as education  training and information solutions 
our continued growth depends  in part  on our ability to generate revenue from new customers and to continue to expand our presence by selling new products and solutions within our existing installed base of customers 
in our management decision making  we continuously balance our need to achieve short term financial and operational goals with the equally critical need to continuously invest in our products  services  solutions and infrastructure to ensure our future success 
in making decisions around spending levels in our various functional organizations  we consider many factors  including our ability to expand our presence and penetration of existing markets  the extent to which we can sell new products  services and solutions to existing customers and sell upgrades to applications from legacy products in our current portfolio  our success in selling our products  services and solutions through our partner network  our ability to expand our presence in new horizontal and vertical markets and broaden our reach geographically  and our ability to pursue  acquire and successfully integrate companies 
we have acquired companies to broaden the products  services and solutions we offer  expand our customer base and provide us with a future opportunity to migrate customers to newer applications we may develop and expand into new geographies 
the products and solutions of the acquired companies provide our customers with core functionality that complements our own established products 
in evaluating our financial condition and operating performance  we consider a variety of factors including  but not limited to  the following the growth rates of the individual components of our revenues licenses  subscriptions  support and services relative to recent historical trends and the growth rate of the overall market as reported or predicted by industry analysts  the margins of our business relative to recent historical trends  our operating expenses and income from operations  our cash flow from operations  the long term success of our development efforts  our ability to successfully penetrate new markets  our ability to successfully integrate acquired companies and achieve anticipated synergies  our win rate against our competitors  and our long term customer retention rates 
each of the factors may be evaluated individually or collectively by our senior management team in evaluating our performance as we balance our short term quarterly objectives and our longer term strategic goals and objectives 
our total revenue for the year ended december  increased by million to million as compared to million for the year ended december  we believe the increase in revenue was attributed to continuing confidence among our customers despite the economic uncertainty  as well as the recent acquisitions we completed 
our license revenue and total revenue for the three months ended december  increased by million and million  respectively  to million and million  respectively  as compared to million and million  respectively  for the three months ended december  license revenue attributable to both our government contracting customers and our professional services customers increased during this period 
we believe this was a result of the strength and diversity of our solutions portfolio  our strong competitive position and the positive market impact of our recent acquisitions 
we believe that the products we have acquired  the new solutions we have offered and our expanded licensing models have given us a more compelling platform for expanding our business in a challenging economic environment 
going forward  we believe that the continuing scrutiny and visibility of government contracting spending and the need to ensure that government projects are successfully completed on time and on budget are important factors driving many of our customers to use our earned value management and project scheduling applications across large segments of their organizations 
moreover  we believe that by combining input s opportunity intelligence and market analysis with our project management  financial management and crm solutions  we are now the only company in the industry that can deliver solutions across the broad spectrum of government contracting requirements and all facets of our customers businesses 
as a result  we expect our costpoint  gcs premier and enterprise project management epm products to continue to account for a significant percentage of our overall software license fee revenue 
at the same time  we expect our professional services solutions to account for a larger percentage of our overall license fee revenue as compared to recent periods 
while the timing and extent of any economic recovery among professional services firms remains uncertain  we expect that our acquisition of maconomy will enable our expansion into other parts of the broader professional services marketplace  both domestically and internationally 
in addition  we believe that our acquisition of maconomy will positively impact our consulting services revenue over the course of we also expect the increase in revenue attributable to our government contracting customers in as compared to to positively impact our consulting services revenue 
in recent years  revenue from maintenance services has increased as a percentage of our total revenue 
we expect this trend to continue as a result of additional sales of software licenses in the future  our high maintenance retention rates and the positive impact of our acquisition of maconomy on software license and maintenance revenues 
in addition  our maintenance revenue reflects purchase accounting fair value adjustments for the maconomy acquisition 
we expect the renewals of maintenance services will result in an increase in maintenance revenue in compared to the company recently reduced headcount in certain areas to realign its resources following the recent acquisitions of input and maconomy 
the company anticipates restructuring charges in as it continues to realign its cost structure and allow for increased investment in key strategic objectives 
we have proactively managed  and will continue to proactively manage  our business to control operating expenses and realign resources in a way that will allow us to maximize near term opportunities while maintaining the flexibility needed to achieve our longer term strategic goals 
critical accounting policies and estimates in presenting our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  costs and expenses and related disclosures 
some of the estimates and assumptions we are required to make relate to matters that are inherently uncertain as they pertain to future events 
we base these estimates and assumptions on historical experience or on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances 
on an ongoing basis  we reconsider and evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
our future estimates may change if the underlying assumptions change 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates 
for further information on our critical and other significant accounting policies  see note  organization and summary of significant accounting policies  of our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report on form k 
we believe that the critical accounting policies listed below involve our more significant judgments  assumptions and estimates and  therefore  could have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition  stock based compensation  income taxes  allowances for doubtful accounts receivable  valuation of purchased intangible assets and acquired deferred revenue  and impairment of identifiable intangible and other long lived assets and goodwill 
in june  the fasb issued the fasb accounting standards codification the codification or asc  the authoritative guidance for gaap 
the codification does not change how we account for transactions or the nature of the related disclosures made 
the codification supersedes all existing non sec accounting and reporting standards and was effective beginning july  in this annual report on form k  the references have been updated to reflect the new codification references 
revenue recognition the company s revenues are generated primarily from four sources licensing of software products  providing maintenance and support for those products  providing consulting services for those products and memberships  including access to market intelligence  analysis and business development related services 
the company recognizes revenue in accordance with asc  software revenue recognition asc  and in accordance with the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
where services are essential to the software functionality or the services carry a significant degree of risk or unique acceptance criteria  the company recognizes the software and services revenue together in accordance with asc  revenue recognition construction type and certain production type contracts asc 
under its standard perpetual software license agreements  the company recognizes revenue from the license of software upon execution of a signed agreement and delivery of the software provided that the software license fees are fixed and determinable  collection of the resulting receivable is probable  and vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists to allow the allocation of a portion of the total fee to any undelivered elements of the arrangement 
if a right of return exists  revenue is recognized upon the expiration of that right 
in the event that vsoe does not exist for any undelivered element  the entire arrangement fee is recognized over the longer of the services  subscription  or maintenance period 
if vsoe exists to allow the allocation of a portion of the total fee to undelivered elements of the arrangement  the residual amount in the arrangement allocated to software license fee is recognized as revenue when all of the following are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
it is our practice to require a signed contract or an accepted purchase order for existing customers 
delivery has occurred 
we deliver software by secure electronic means or physical delivery 
both means of delivery transfer title and risk to the customer 
shipping terms are generally fob shipping point 
the software license sale is fixed and determinable 
we recognize revenue for the license component of multiple element arrangements only when vsoe of fair value of any undelivered elements is known  any uncertainties surrounding customer acceptance are resolved and there are no refund  return  or cancellation rights associated with the delivered elements 
software license sales are generally considered fixed and determinable when payment terms are within days 
collectibility is probable 
amounts receivable must be collectible 
for license arrangements that do not meet our collectibility standards  revenue is recognized as cash is received 
the company s standard software license agreement does not include customer acceptance provisions  if acceptance provisions are provided  delivery is deemed to occur upon acceptance 
the company also sells certain of its software products under term license agreements 
term licenses offer the customer rights to software bundled with maintenance and support for a fixed period of time  usually twelve months 
in some cases implementation services are also included in the initial period fee 
hosting services may also be included in the fee 
under these arrangements revenue is recognized ratably over the contractual period 
software license fee revenues from resellers are recognized using a sell through model whereby the company recognizes revenue when these channels complete the sale and delivers the software to the end user 
the company s standard payment terms for its software license agreements are generally within days 
the company considers the software license fee to be fixed and determinable unless the fee is subject to refund or adjustment  or is not payable within days 
revenue from arrangements with payment terms extending beyond days is recognized as payments become due and payable 
sales taxes and other taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are presented on a net basis and  as such  are excluded from revenues 
maintenance and support services include unspecified periodic software upgrades or enhancements  bug fixes and phone support for perpetual software licenses 
initial annual maintenance and support are sold as a consistent percentage of the software price 
customers generally prepay for maintenance  and these prepayments are recorded as deferred revenue and revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance period 
deltek s consulting services consist primarily of implementation services  training  and design services 
consulting services are also regularly sold separately from other elements  generally on a time and materials basis 
other revenue mainly includes fees collected for the company s annual user conference  which is typically held in the second quarter 
consulting services are generally not essential to the functionality of the company s software and are usually completed in three to six months  though larger implementations may take longer 
the company generally recognizes revenues for these services as they are performed 
in the case of software arrangements where services are essential to the software functionality or the services carry a significant degree of risk or unique acceptance criteria  the company recognizes the software and services revenue together in accordance with asc  revenue recognition construction type and certain production type contracts asc 
direct costs related to these arrangements are deferred and expensed as the related revenue is recognized 
implementation  installation and other consulting services are generally billed based upon hourly rates  plus reimbursable out of pocket expenses and related administrative fees 
revenue on these arrangements is recognized based on hours actually incurred at the contract billing rates  plus out of pocket expenses 
implementation  installation and other consulting services revenue under fixed fee arrangements is generally recognized as the services are performed if the company has the ability to demonstrate it can reasonably estimate percentage of completion 
the company generally sells training services at a fixed rate for each specific training session at a per attendee price  and revenue is recognized when the customer attends the training 
the company also sells training on a time and materials basis 
in situations where customers pay for services in advance of the services being rendered  the related prepayment is recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue when the services are performed 
membership revenues  including access to market intelligence analysis and business development services generally provide customers with access to the govwin or input networks for a fixed period of time  usually twelve months 
under these arrangements  revenue is recognized ratably over the membership period 
customers generally prepay for these subscription offerings  and these prepayments are recorded as deferred revenue and revenue is recognized over the term of the term license or membership 
for sales arrangements involving multiple elements  where software licenses are sold together with maintenance and support  consulting  training  or subscription offerings  the company recognizes revenue using the residual method 
the residual accounting method is used since vsoe has not been established for software as it is not typically sold on a standalone basis 
using this method  the company first allocates revenue to the undelivered elements on the basis of vsoe 
the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered elements is recognized as revenue for the delivered elements  which is usually the software component 
the company has established vsoe for standard offerings of maintenance and support and consulting services based on the price charged when these elements are sold on a standalone basis 
for maintenance and support agreements  vsoe is generally based upon historical renewal rates 
for consulting services and training sold as part of a multiple element sales arrangement  vsoe is based upon the prices charged for those services when sold separately 
for sales arrangements that require the company to deliver future specified products or services for which vsoe of fair value is not available  the entire arrangement is deferred until vsoe is available or delivery has occurred 
for income statement classification purposes revenue is allocated first to the undelivered element based on vsoe 
any remaining arrangement fee is then allocated to the software license 
in cases where software licenses and other elements are sold in combination with subscription offerings all revenue is recognized ratably over the longest period of performance for the undelivered elements 
for income statement classification purposes revenue is allocated based on vsoe for maintenance  training  and consulting services 
for subscription offerings  vsoe has not yet been established  and revenue is therefore allocated to the undelivered subscription offerings based on the contractually stated renewal rate 
under the residual method  any remaining arrangement fee is allocated to the software license 
stock based compensation asc  compensation stock compensation asc  requires that the cost of awards of equity instruments offered in exchange for employee services  including employee stock options  restricted stock awards  and employee stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan espp  are measured based on the fair value of the award on the measurement date of grant 
we determine the fair value of options granted and employee stock purchases using the black scholes merton option pricing model and recognize the cost over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award  generally the vesting period in the case of options 
the fair value of restricted stock awards is based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period of the awards 
in accordance with asc  we recorded million  million and million in stock based compensation expense for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the compensation expense recorded for the years ended december    and related to stock options  restricted stock awards and the espp 
the key assumptions used by management in the black scholes merton option pricing model include the fair value of our common stock at the grant date  which is also used to determine the option exercise price  the expected life of the option  the expected volatility of our common stock over the life of the option and the risk free interest rate 
in determining the amount of stock based compensation to record  management must also estimate expected forfeitures of stock options over the expected life of the options 
prior to our initial public offering in november and given the absence of an active market for our common stock  our board of directors or compensation committee or its authorized member s estimated the fair value of our common stock at the time of each grant 
numerous objective and subjective factors were considered in estimating the value of our common stock at each option grant date in accordance with the guidance in aicpa practice aid valuation of privately held company equity securities issued as compensation 
because we do not have significant history associated with our stock options in order to determine the expected volatility of our options  we calculated expected volatility as of each grant date using an implied volatility method based in part on reported data for a peer group of publicly traded software companies for which historical information was available  as well as our volatility since the date of our initial public offering 
we will continue to use peer group volatility information until sufficient historical volatility of our common stock is available to measure expected volatility for future option grants 
the average expected life of our stock options was determined according to the sec simplified method as described in sab no 
 share based payment  which is the midpoint between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term 
the risk free interest rate was determined by reference to the us treasury yield curve rates with the remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant 
forfeitures were estimated based on our historical analysis of actual stock option forfeitures and employee turnover 
an increase or decrease by in the forfeiture rate would not have a material effect on our financial statements 
income taxes we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we record this amount as a provision or benefit for taxes in accordance with asc  income taxes asc 
this process involves estimating our current tax exposure  including assessing the risks associated with tax audits and assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are recorded in our financial statements 
although we believe that our estimates are reasonable  the final tax outcome of these matters could be different from our estimates reflected in our income tax provision 
as such  any potential difference could have a material effect on our effective tax rate and consequently affect our operating results for the period in which such determination is made 
we follow asc which requires significant judgment in determining what constitutes an individual tax position as well as assessing the outcome of each tax position 
changes in judgment as to recognition and measurement of tax positions can affect the estimate of the effective tax rate and consequently affect our operating results 
as of december   we had deferred tax assets of approximately million  which were primarily related to differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expenses for book and tax purposes 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
as of december   we have valuation allowances totaling million recorded on the sweden  netherlands and uk entities acquired during the maconomy transaction  as we have determined it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would not be realized 
our deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded at the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
if a change to the expected tax rate is determined to be appropriate due to differences between our assumptions and actual results of operations or statutory tax rates  it will affect the provision for income taxes during the period that the determination is made 
allowances for doubtful accounts receivable we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts and sales allowances to provide adequate provision for potential losses from collecting less than full payment on our accounts receivable 
we record provisions for sales allowances  which generally result from credits issued to customers in conjunction with cancellations of maintenance agreements or billing adjustments  as a reduction to revenues 
we record provisions for bad debt  or credit losses  as a general and administrative expense in our income statement 
we base these provisions on a review of our accounts receivable aging  individual overdue accounts  historical write offs and adjustments of customer accounts due to service or other issues and an assessment of the general economic environment 
valuation of purchased intangible assets and acquired deferred revenue we allocate the purchase price paid in a business combination to the assets acquired  including intangible assets  and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values 
such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions and estimates we believe to be reasonable 
these estimates are based upon a number of factors  including historical experience  market conditions and management projections 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include  but are not limited to  historical and projected customer retention rates  anticipated growth in revenue from the acquired customer and product base and the expected use of the acquired assets 
we amortize acquired intangible assets using either accelerated or straight line methods depending upon which best approximates the proportion of future cash flows estimated to be generated in each period over the estimated useful life of the specific asset 
management must estimate the expected life and future cash flows from the acquired asset  both of which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
changes in the assumptions used in developing these estimates could have a material impact on the amortization expense recorded in our financial statements 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of our assumptions and estimates 
as an example  for all of the acquisitions made during the years through  we are amortizing the customer relationship intangible assets on an accelerated method using lives of four to ten years 
the use of an accelerated method was based upon our estimates of the projected cash flows from the assets and the proportion of those cash flows received over the estimated life and evaluated on annual basis to ensure continued appropriateness 
had we used a straight line method of amortization  amortization expense for would have been approximately million less than the amount recorded 
if we were to continue to use the same accelerated method  but reduce the estimated useful lives of those assets by one year  total amortization expense would have been higher by million for we amortize acquired technology from our acquisitions using either an accelerated or a straight line method over three to five years 
if the useful lives for those assets were reduced by one year  amortization expense for would have been approximately million which is million higher than the current year expense 
as a component of our acquisitions  we acquired maintenance and subscription obligations and the associated deferred revenue with our acquisitions 
we valued acquired deferred revenue based on estimates of the cost of providing solution support services plus a reasonable profit margin 
upon each acquisition  the acquired deferred revenue balances were recorded at an average of of their book value on the date of acquisition 
this reduced deferred revenue amount is recognized as revenue over the remaining contractual period of the obligation  generally no more than one year from the date of acquisition 
changes in the estimates used in determining these valuations could result in more or less revenue being recorded 
impairment of identifiable intangible and other long lived assets and goodwill we review identifiable intangible and other long lived assets for impairment in accordance with asc  property  plant  and equipment asc whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may be impaired or unrecoverable 
we assess the impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in accordance with asc  intangibles goodwill and other asc 
accordingly  we test our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually at december or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred 
the impairment test for goodwill compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount exceeds its fair value  impairment is indicated 
the impairment is measured as the excess of the recorded goodwill over its fair value 
the impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets compares the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset with its carrying amount 
if the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount  an impairment is measured as the excess of the carrying amount over the fair market value 
factors that indicate the carrying amount of goodwill  identifiable intangible assets or other long lived assets that may not be recoverable include under performance relative to historical or projected operating results  significant changes or limitations in the manner of our use of the acquired assets  changes in our business strategy  adverse market conditions  changes in applicable laws or regulations and a variety of other factors and circumstances 
we determine the recoverability of our long lived assets by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to our current estimates of net future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate or fair market value 
if we determine that the carrying value of a long lived asset may not be recoverable  an impairment charge is recognized  as an operating expense  equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair market value of the asset in the period the determination is made

we sell our software applications to end user customers mainly through our direct sales force  as well as indirectly through our network of alliance partners and resellers 
the timing of the sales cycle for our products varies in length based upon a variety of factors  including the size of the customer  the product being sold and whether the customer is a new or existing customer 
while price is an important consideration  we primarily compete on product features  functionality and the needs of our customers within our served markets 
software revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to our revenue included million in revenue attributable to our maconomy products  which we acquired in july in addition  for the year ended december   license fee revenues from our costpoint  gcs premier and epm products increased million compared to the prior year  while license fee revenues from our vision products decreased by million for the same period 
software revenues decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to for  software revenues from our costpoint  gcs premier and epm products decreased million compared with the prior year  while license fee revenues from our vision products decreased by million for the same period 
the decrease in revenues from sales of our costpoint  gcs premier and epm products to government contractor customers was partially attributable to the impact of two larger deals in that were not replicated in  and was also attributable to customers taking a more cautious approach with regard to purchasing and investment decisions in light of the general economic climate 
we believe the decrease in revenues from sales of our vision products was mainly attributable to customers deferring purchasing decisions  lengthening sales cycles and adopting more cautious investment policies during the economic downturn 
subscription and recurring revenues our subscription and recurring revenues are comprised of fees derived from arrangements in which the company s customers subscribe to information  products and services 
in addition  there are subscription and recurring revenues related to other deltek products

in addition  we recognized maintenance revenues of million in from maconomy maintenance contracts 
in  our maintenance revenues for our vision products decreased by million 
we believe that this was a result of a limited number of smaller architecture and engineering customers not renewing maintenance in light of the challenging economic environment and our discontinuance of maintenance and support for certain legacy products 
the sales allowance decreased slightly by million 
we expect that maintenance revenues will continue to be a significant source of revenue throughout given our high maintenance retention rate and our stable base of customers 
maintenance revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to maintenance revenues from our costpoint  gcs premier  and epm products collectively increased million year over year  and maintenance revenues from our vision products increased million

consulting services and other revenues decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to this was primarily a result of a million decline in software implementation consulting services attributed to the impact of some large implementation projects coming to a successful conclusion early in that were not repeated 
in addition  the decline was partially attributed to the lower software license sales in also contributing to the decrease is million in training revenue 
these revenue decreases were offset by million of consulting services revenues associated with our acquisition of maconomy 
other revenues decreased million from we expect continued demand in for consulting services from customers due to additional purchases of our applications and the expansion of their use of our software and solutions 
consulting services and other revenues decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to this was a result of a million decline in software implementation consulting services attributed to decreased software license fees

these plans included a reduction of headcount which resulted in million in aggregate restructuring charges for severance and severance related costs 
in addition  the company recorded a restructuring charge of million for the consolidation of offices associated with the maconomy acquisition 
certain restructuring plans were implemented in to realign the company s cost structure and to allow for increased investment in its key strategic objectives

the charge taken in the second quarter of included million for severance and severance related costs 
the charge also included million for facilities related expenses  associated with closure of one office location and a reduction in space at a second location  and was offset by a reduction in existing deferred rent liabilities 
the company anticipates additional restructuring charges in as it realigns its cost structure and resources following the recent acquisitions of input and maconomy and to allow for increased investment in its key strategic objectives 
interest income interest income in all periods reflects interest earned on our invested cash balances 
interest income remained relatively flat at million for the year ended december  compared to interest income decreased million for the year ended december  compared to the principal drivers of this decrease were the change in the company s investment election for its funds from a traditional money market fund to a us treasury securities money market fund as well as the overall decrease in interest rates paid on money market funds 
interest expense year ended december  versus versus change change change change dollars in millions interest expense interest expense increased million for the year ended december  compared to the increase was attributed to an increase in the effective interest rate from in to in we anticipate that interest expense will increase in due to the amendment and extension of the credit agreement in november see discussion below in the credit agreement section  which increased the principal outstanding under the term loans offsetting the interest rate decrease to the libo rate plus with a libo rate floor of for both the term loans and revolving credit facility 
interest expense decreased by million for the year ended december  compared to the decreases resulted from an overall decrease in the british banker s association interest settlement rates for dollar deposits the libo rate as well as from the prepayment of debt during the first half of loss on extinguishment of debt a loss on extinguishment of debt of million was recognized from the amendment and extension of the company s credit agreement in november income taxes year ended december  versus versus change change change change dollars in millions income tax expense income tax expense for the year ended december  decreased million to million compared to million for the twelve months ended december  as a percentage of pre tax income  income tax expense was and for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
the income tax expense for is lower than the income tax expense for due primarily to lower pre tax income  and is offset by the non deductibility of certain transaction related costs of approximately million 
income tax expense decreased by million for the year ended december  compared to the as a percentage of pre tax income  income tax expense was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily the result of lower pre tax income as well as various implemented tax strategies including increased credits for qualified research and development activities  the utilization of foreign tax credits not scheduled to expire for ten years  and the deductibility of certain expenses 
during the twelve months ended december   the company established an additional liability of approximately million associated with the establishment of a reserve for foreign tax and research and development tax credits as well as certain permanent adjustments and associated interest on prior period asc adjustments

credit agreement the company has maintained a credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders led by credit suisse the credit agreement since in november  we amended and extended the credit agreement  providing for million in aggregate borrowings  consisting of million in secured term loans maturing in november and a million secured revolving credit facility maturing in november the new revolving credit facility was undrawn at closing 
all prior amounts outstanding under the credit agreement approximately million were prepaid in full out of proceeds from the new term loans 
the remaining proceeds of million  less debt issuance costs of approximately million  will be used for general corporate purposes 
the amendment and extension included an original issuance debt discount of  or million  which  along with the deferred debt issuance costs  will be amortized over the term of the loan using the effective interest method 
the original issue debt discount was included in the million of debt issuance costs noted above 
under the credit agreement for both the term loans and the revolving credit facility  we will pay an interest rate equal to the british banker s association interest settlement rates for dollar deposits the libo rate plus  with a libo rate floor of 
interest rates prior to the amendment and extension were either or above the libo rate and contained a libo rate floor of and the rate for the revolving credit facility was or  depending on the type of borrowing 
the company will pay a fee equal to of the undrawn portion on the revolving credit facility that expires in november the credit agreement requires the company to make principal payments of million per quarter through september  with the remaining balance due in november as of december  and december   the outstanding principal amount of the term loans was million  excluding the reduction of the unamortized debt discount of million  and million  respectively  and there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility  except for letters of credit totaling less than million 
all loans under the credit agreement are collateralized by substantially all of our assets including our domestic subsidiaries assets and require us to comply with certain financial covenants 
there were no material modifications to our debt covenants under the amendment to our credit agreement  except that the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant was replaced by a maximum capital expenditures covenant 
other covenants require us to maintain defined minimum levels of interest coverage and provide for a limitation on our leverage ratio 
the following table summarizes the significant financial covenants under the credit agreement adjusted ebitda below is based on the terms of the credit agreement as of december  most restrictive required level covenant requirement calculation required level actual level minimum interest coverage cumulative adjusted ebitda for the prior four quarters consolidated interest expense greater than to greater than to capital expenditure capital expenditure not to exceed required level million in million million in leverage coverage total debt cumulative adjusted ebitda for the prior four quarters less than to to effective january  the credit agreement also requires us to comply with non financial covenants that restrict or limit certain corporate activities by us and our subsidiaries  including our ability to incur additional indebtedness  guarantee obligations  or create liens on our assets  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  engage in mergers or consolidations  or pay cash dividends 
based on our current and expected performance  we believe we will continue to satisfy the financial covenants of our credit agreement for the foreseeable future 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants under our credit agreement 
we incurred approximately million of debt issuance costs in connection with the credit agreement  of which million will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the credit agreement using the effective interest method and million was expensed as a loss on extinguishment of debt on the consolidated statements of operations 
of the approximately million of previously deferred debt issuance costs as of november   million was expensed as a loss on extinguishment of debt and the remaining amount will be amortized over the term of the credit agreement 
in  we paid million of debt issuance costs in connection with the amendment to our credit agreement  of which million was being amortized to interest expense over the term of the modified debt and the previously deferred debt issuance costs of million as of august were being amortized to interest expense over that same period 
we incurred no debt issuance costs in the credit agreement requires mandatory prepayments of the term loans from our annual excess cash flow  and from the net proceeds of certain asset sales or equity issuances 
during the first quarter of  we made a scheduled principal payment of million and a contractually required principal prepayment of million from our annual excess cash flow 
we will not make an excess cash flow payment in  under the credit agreement  due to the permitted acquisitions that occurred during the credit agreement also requires us to prepay a portion of the term loans from the net proceeds of certain equity issuances so that our leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement is less than  if on or before december   or  if anytime thereafter 
see discussion below in contractual obligations and commitments for our future scheduled principal payments under the credit agreement 
liquidity and capital resources overview of liquidity our primary operating cash requirements include the payment of salaries  incentive compensation and related benefits  and other headcount related costs as well as the costs of office facilities and information technology systems 
we fund these requirements through cash collections from our customers for the purchase of our software  subscriptions  consulting services and maintenance services 
amounts due from customers for software license  subscriptions and maintenance services are generally billed in advance of the contract period 
the cost of our acquisitions has been financed with available cash flow and  to the extent necessary  term loan and revolving credit facility borrowings 
we utilize our revolving credit facility for the additional purpose of providing the required guarantee related to certain letters of credit for our real estate leases 
at december   the total amount of letters of credit guaranteed under the revolving credit facility was million 
as a result  available borrowings on the revolving credit facility at december  were million 
historically  our cash flows have been subject to variability from year to year  primarily as a result of one time or infrequent events 
these events have included acquisitions and the repayment of indebtedness 
we expect that our future growth will continue to require additional working capital 
although such future working capital requirements are difficult to forecast based on our current estimates of revenues and expenses  we believe that anticipated cash flows from operations and available sources of funds including available borrowings under our revolving credit facility will provide sufficient liquidity for us to fund our business and meet our obligations for the next twelve months 
in addition  our credit agreement provides for greater financial flexibility by extending our debt repayment requirements over a longer term 
we also believe that our aggregate cash balance of million as of december   coupled with anticipated cash flows from operations and available sources of funds including available borrowings under our revolving credit facility  is sufficient to cover the payments due over the near term under the credit agreement 
in the future  however  we may require additional liquidity to fund our operations  strategic investments and acquisitions  and debt repayment obligations  which could entail raising additional funds or modifying the terms of our credit agreement 
in june  we completed our common stock rights offering  which was fully subscribed by our stockholders  resulting in the issuance of million shares of common stock 
net proceeds after deducting fees and offering expenses were approximately million 
we used approximately million to prepay indebtedness under our credit agreement and used the remaining net proceeds from the rights offering for additional working capital  strategic investments and acquisitions  reduction of indebtedness or general corporate purposes 
analysis of cash flows for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was million  compared to million in the increase of million was attributed to an increase from deferred revenues of million attributed to moving to annual maintenance billing in and the acquisitions of maconomy and input  an increase in non cash operating activities of million primarily attributed to the increase in depreciation and amortization due to the acquisitions of maconomy and input  a reduction in tax payments of million and other items of million 
these increases were offset by a decrease in net income of million and an increase in interest payments of million 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was million  compared to million in the million increase was attributed to decreases of million for tax payments  million in interest payments and million in other operating costs  and was partially offset by an increase in cash payments for restructuring charges of million 
the increase in deferred revenue of million was primarily attributed to the acceleration of our maintenance billing process 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million in in  we used million for the acquisitions of maconomy  input and sira and million for the purchase of property and equipment 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million in our use of cash during the year ended december  for investment activities primarily included million for the acquisition of mysbx  and million for the purchase of property and equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million provided during the year ended december  cash provided by financing activities during the year ended december  was primarily related to proceeds from the amendment and extension of our credit agreement of million and proceeds received from issuance of stock under our employee stock purchase plan espp as well as stock option exercises of million 
this was offset by million in debt repayments primarily attributed to the repayment of prior outstanding amounts under the credit agreement  payments for deferred financing costs of million and million for shares withheld for minimum tax withholding on vested restricted stock awards 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million in cash provided by financing activities during the year ended december  was primarily related to net proceeds received from our rights offering of million  and proceeds from issuance of stock under our employee stock purchase plan espp as well as stock option exercises of million 
this was offset by million in debt repayments and payments for deferred financing costs of million 
debt repayments consisted of a scheduled cash repayment of million and contractually required debt prepayments of million 
impact of seasonality fluctuations in our quarterly software license fee revenues historically reflect  in part  seasonal fluctuations driven by our customers procurement cycles for enterprise software and other factors 
these factors historically yield a peak in software license fee revenue in the fourth quarter due to increased spending by our customers during that time 
however  as a result of the current economic environment  the seasonality of our business was impacted by our customers views of their economic outlook 
therefore  past seasonality may not be indicative of current or future seasonality 
our consulting services revenues are impacted by software license sales  the availability of consulting resources to work on customer implementations  and the adequacy of our contracting activity to maintain full utilization of available resources 
as a result  services revenues are much less subject to seasonal fluctuations 
our maintenance and subscription revenues are not subject to significant seasonal fluctuations 
contractual obligations and commitments we have various contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
our material capital commitments consist of term loan related debt obligations and commitments under facilities and operating leases 
we rarely enter into binding purchase commitments 
the following table summarizes our existing contractual obligations and contractual commitments as of december  payments due by december  contractual obligations total thereafter dollars in thousands term loans estimated interest payments on term loans operating leases capital leases other long term liabilities following the repayment of million in the fourth quarter of  our scheduled repayments on the outstanding amount of the term loans are million per year for the years through and million due in for a total of million 
however  the amount and timing of these scheduled payments could vary based on the required mandatory prepayments from our annual excess cash flow  and from the net proceeds of certain asset sales or equity issuances as defined in the credit agreement 
the credit agreement included an original issuance debt discount of  or million which is a reduction to the face value of the term loans of million  at december   which will be amortized over the term of the loan using the effective interest method 
therefore  the amount outstanding on the consolidated balance sheet at december  of million is net of the unamortized debt discount of million at december  currently  we pay an interest rate on the term loans equal to the libo rate plus  with a libo rate floor of 
based on the libo rate floor in place under the credit agreement and the prevailing libo interest rate being less than  we have estimated the interest payments in the above table at a rate equal to the minimum rate of the amount included in other long term liabilities represents the contingent consideration liability from our acquisition of sira  inc in march  which is based on meeting license sales over a three year period not to exceed a maximum earn out amount of million and maconomy s earn out payment obligation for people planner of million 
our current forecasts indicate that the earn out payments will be achieved 
the above table does not include approximately million of long term income tax liabilities recorded in accordance with asc because we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of these potential future payments 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements 
indemnification we provide limited indemnification to our customers against intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties arising from the use of our software products 
due to the established nature of our primary software products and the lack of intellectual property infringement claims in the past  we cannot estimate the fair value nor determine the total nominal amount of the indemnification  if any 
estimated losses for such indemnification are evaluated under asc  contingencies  as interpreted by asc  guarantees 
we have secured copyright and trademark registrations for our software products with the us patent and trademark office and with applicable european trademark offices 
we also have intellectual property infringement indemnification from our third party partners whose technology may be embedded or otherwise bundled with our software products 
therefore  we generally consider the probability of an unfavorable outcome in an intellectual property infringement case to be relatively low 
we have not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to such indemnifications 
recently adopted accounting pronouncements in april  the fasb issued asc  intangibles goodwill and other general intangibles other than goodwill 
asc amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under asc  intangibles goodwill and other 
the objective is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under asc and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under asc asc is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the guidance in asc for useful life estimates is applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired after december  beginning in  we adopted asc which was applied to our acquisition and prospectively 
in november  the fasb issued asc  intangibles goodwill and other general intangibles other than goodwill 
asc clarifies the accounting for acquired intangible assets in situations in which the acquirer does not intend to actively use the asset but intends to hold lock up the asset to prevent its competitors from obtaining access to the asset a defensive intangible asset 
under asc  defensive intangible assets will be treated as a separate asset recognized at fair value and assigned a useful life in accordance with asc asc is effective for intangible assets acquired on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december   or january  for deltek 
during and  we did not acquire any defensive intangible assets 
in april  the fasb issued asc  business combinations identifiable assets and liabilities  and any noncontrolling interest 
asc amends the guidance in asc regarding pre acquisition contingencies 
the guidance in asc requires the recognition at fair value of an asset or liability assumed in a business combination that arises from a contingency if the acquisition date fair value can be reasonably estimated during the measurement period 
if the fair value cannot be reasonably estimated  the asset or liability would be recognized in accordance with asc  contingencies  if the criteria in asc were met at the acquisition date 
previously  asc required pre acquisition contingencies to be measured at fair value at the date of acquisition 
asc is effective for business combinations occurring after january  beginning in  we adopted asc  however  we did not acquire any pre acquisition contingencies in the acquisitions made during and in april  the fasb issued asc  financial instruments transition  effective for interim periods ending after june  asc requires disclosures about fair value of financial instruments for interim reporting periods of publicly traded companies as well as in annual financial statements to improve the transparency and quality of financial reporting 
asc amends asc  interim reporting  to require those disclosures in summarized financial information at interim reporting periods 
see part ii  item  note  fair value measurements  for the related disclosures 
the adoption of asc in the second quarter of did not have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position  or cash flows 
in april  the fasb issued asc  fair value measurements and disclosures subsequent measurement 
asc provides guidance on how to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability has significantly decreased 
asc also provides guidance on identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction is not orderly 
in addition  asc requires disclosure in interim and annual periods of the inputs and valuation methods used in determining fair value and a discussion of any changes in those valuation methods 
asc is effective for annual and interim periods ending on or after june  during the second quarter of  we adopted the provisions in asc the provisions adopted did not have an impact on our financial statements as our fair value measurements are level measurements in an active market with orderly transactions 
in may  the fasb issued asc  subsequent events  effective for interim and annual periods ending after june  asc establishes the accounting for  and disclosure of  events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
the adoption of asc in the second quarter of did not have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position  or cash flows 
in august  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
asu  fair value measurement and disclosure measuring liabilities at fair value  which amends asc the guidance in asu provides clarification on measuring liabilities at fair value when a quoted price in an active market is not available 
the asu specifies that a valuation technique should be applied that uses either the quote of the liability when traded as an asset  the quoted prices for similar liabilities or similar liabilities when traded as assets  or another valuation technique consistent with existing fair value measurement guidance such as a present value technique or a technique that is based on the amount at the measurement date that the reporting entity would pay to transfer the identical liability or would receive to enter into the identical liability 
the guidance also states that when estimating the fair value of a liability  a reporting entity is not required to include a separate input or adjustments to other inputs relating to the existence of a restriction that prevents the transfer of the liability 
asu is effective for the first reporting period beginning after issuance  or october  the adoption of asu did not have an impact on our financial statements as we currently do not have any liabilities measured at fair value 
in january  the fasb issued asu  improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
asu requires new disclosures concerning transfers into and out of level and level of the fair value measurement hierarchy and a roll forward of the activity of assets and liabilities measured in level of the hierarchy 
in addition  asu clarifies existing disclosure requirements to require fair value measurement disclosures for each class of assets and liabilities and disclosure regarding the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure level or level fair value measurements on a recurring and nonrecurring basis 
asu is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  except for the roll forward of activity for level fair value measurements  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of asu did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued asu asu  business combinations topic disclosure of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations 
in a business combination asc  business combinations  requires disclosure of supplemental pro forma information of the revenue and earnings of the combined entity for a business combination that occurred during the reporting period 
asu clarifies the time period in which the acquisition date occurred for pro forma purposes 
specifically for comparative financial statements  the pro forma revenue and earnings of the combined entity are presented as though the acquisition date for a business combination that occurred during the current reporting period had been at the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period 
asu is effective prospectively for business combinations occurring in fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
we applied this guidance in the current year in our pro forma disclosures for our acquisitions of maconomy and input 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  and the fasb issued asu  certain revenue arrangements that include software elements  on revenue recognition that will become effective beginning january   with earlier adoption permitted 
we do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards will have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic when to perform step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
asu addresses how to apply step of the goodwill impairment test when a reporting unit has a zero or negative carrying amount 
asu requires for those reporting units with a zero or negative carrying amount to perform step of the impairment test if qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
asu is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of asu to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our outstanding debt and cash and cash equivalents consisting primarily of funds held in money market accounts on a short term basis with no withdrawal restrictions 
at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
our interest expense associated with our term loans and revolving credit facility can vary with market rates 
as of december   we had approximately million of the principal amount in debt outstanding  which was effectively set at a fixed rate at december   due to the libo rate floor established of in the credit agreement and the libo rate at december  being below the established floor 
however  an increase in the libo rate above the libo rate floor subsequent to december  could cause our fixed rate debt to become variable and our interest expense to vary 
we cannot predict market fluctuations in interest rates and their impact on our possible variable rate debt  or whether fixed rate long term debt will be available to us at favorable rates  if at all 
consequently  future results may differ materially from the hypothetical increase discussed above 
based on the investment interest rate and our cash and cash equivalents balance as of december   a hypothetical decrease in interest rates would have an insignificant impact on our earnings and cash flows on an annual basis 
we do not currently use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
foreign currency exchange risk the majority of our operations are transacted in us dollars 
however  since a growing portion of our operations consists of activities outside of the us  we have transactions in other currencies  primarily in the danish krone  the british pound  the philippine peso  the australian dollar  the swedish krona  the norwegian kroner and the euro 
as our international operations continue to grow  we may choose to use foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations 
currently  we do not have any such contracts in place  nor did we have any such contracts during   or to date  the foreign currency exchange fluctuations have not had a significant impact on our operating results and cash flows given the scope of our international presence 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in foreign currency exchange rates from the rates used to translate our foreign operations financial statements would have impacted our net income by less than million during the year ended december  our net assets at december  would have been impacted by less than million from a hypothetical increase or decrease in the foreign currency exchange rates used to translate our financial position at december
