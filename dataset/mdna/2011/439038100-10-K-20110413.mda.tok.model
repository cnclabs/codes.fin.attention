item a 
risk factors our business is subject to a variety of risks 
the risk factors detailed below should be considered in conjunction with the other information contained in this annual report on form k 
if any of these risks actually materialize  our business  financial condition and future prospects could be negatively impacted 
these risks are not the only ones we face 
there may be additional risks that are presently unknown to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial that could affect our business 
economic downturns could result in a decrease in sales and earnings 
the furniture industry is subject to cyclical variations in the general economy and to uncertainty regarding future economic prospects 
home furnishings are generally considered a postponeable purchase by most consumers 
economic downturns could affect consumer spending habits by decreasing the overall demand for home furnishings 
these events could also impact retailers  hooker s primary customers  possibly resulting in a decrease in our sales or earnings 
changes in interest rates  consumer confidence  new housing starts  existing home sales  the availability of consumer credit and geopolitical factors have particularly significant effects on our company 
a recovery in the company s sales could lag significantly behind a general recovery in the economy after an economic downturn due to the postponeable nature and relatively significant cost of home furnishings purchases 
we depend on suppliers in china for almost all of our imported furniture products  and a disruption in supply from china or from our most significant chinese supplier could undermine our ability to timely fill customer orders for these products and adversely affect our sourcing costs 
in fiscal  imported products sourced from china accounted for approximately of our import purchases and the factory in china from which we directly source the largest portion of our import products accounted for approximately of our worldwide purchases of imported products 
a sudden disruption in our supply chain from this factory  or from china in general  could significantly impact our ability to fill customer orders for products manufactured at that factory or in that country 
if such a disruption were to occur  we believe that we would have sufficient inventory to adequately meet demand for approximately four months 
we believe that we could  most likely at higher cost  source most of the products currently sourced in china from factories in other countries and could produce certain upholstered products domestically at our own factories 
however  supply disruptions and delays on selected items could occur for up to six months before remedial measures could be implemented 
if we were to be unsuccessful in obtaining those products from other sources or at comparable cost  then a sudden disruption in our supply chain from our largest import furniture supplier  or from china in general  could have a short term material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we may lose market share due to competition  which would decrease sales and earnings 
the furniture industry is very competitive and fragmented 
hooker competes with many domestic and foreign residential furniture sources 
some competitors have greater financial resources than we have and often offer extensively advertised  well recognized  branded products 
competition from foreign sources has increased dramatically over the past decade 
we may not be able to meet price competition or otherwise respond to competitive pressures  including increases in supplier and production costs 
also  due to the large number of competitors and their wide range of product offerings  we may not be able to continue to differentiate our products through value and styling  finish and other construction techniques from those of our competitors 
in addition  some large furniture retailers are sourcing directly from asian furniture factories 
over time  this practice may expand to smaller retailers 
as a result  we are continually subject to the risk of losing market share  which may lower sales and earnings 

table of contents failure to anticipate or timely respond to changes in fashion and consumer tastes could adversely impact our business and decrease sales and earnings 
furniture is a styled product and is subject to rapidly changing fashion trends and consumer tastes  as well as to increasingly shorter product life cycles 
if we fail to anticipate or promptly respond to these changes we may lose market share or be faced with the decision of whether to sell excess inventory at reduced prices 
this could result in lower sales and earnings 
a loss of several large customers through business consolidations  failures or other reasons could result in a decrease in future sales and earnings 
the loss of several of our major customers through business consolidations  failures or otherwise  could materially adversely affect our sales and earnings 
lost sales may be difficult to replace 
amounts owed to hooker by a customer whose business fails  or is failing  may become uncollectible 
our ability to grow sales and earnings depends on the successful execution of our business strategies 
we are primarily a residential furniture design  sourcing  marketing and logistics company with domestic upholstery manufacturing capabilities 
our ability to maintain and grow sales and earnings depends on the continued correct selection and successful execution and refinement of our overall business strategies and business systems for designing  marketing  sourcing  distributing and servicing our products 
we must also make good decisions about product mix and inventory availability targets 
since we have exited domestic manufacturing of wood furniture and are now completely dependent on offshore suppliers for wood and metal furniture products  we must continue to enhance relationships and business systems that allow us to continue to work more efficiently and effectively with our global sourcing suppliers 
we must also continue to evaluate the appropriate mix between domestic manufacturing and foreign sourcing for upholstered products 
all of these factors affect our ability to grow sales and earnings 
changes in the value of the us dollar compared to the currencies for the countries from which we obtain our products could adversely affect net sales and profit margins 
for imported products  we generally negotiate firm pricing with our foreign suppliers in us dollars  typically for periods of at least one year 
we accept the exposure to exchange rate movements beyond these negotiated periods 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage this risk 
since we transact our imported product purchases in us dollars  a relative decline in the value of the us dollar could increase the price we must pay for imported products beyond the negotiated periods 
these price changes could adversely impact net sales and profit margins during affected periods 
our dependence on offshore suppliers could  over time  adversely affect our ability to service customers  which could lower sales and earnings 
we rely exclusively on offshore suppliers for our wood and metal furniture products and for a significant portion of our upholstered products 
our offshore suppliers may not provide goods that meet our quality  design or other specifications in a timely manner and at a competitive price 
if our suppliers do not meet our specifications  we may need to find alternative vendors  potentially at a higher cost  or may be forced to discontinue products 
also  delivery of goods from offshore vendors may be delayed for reasons not typically encountered for domestically manufactured furniture  such as shipment delays caused by customs issues  labor issues  decreased availability of shipping containers and or the inability to secure space aboard shipping vessels to transport our products 
our failure to timely fill customer orders during an extended business interruption for a major offshore supplier  or due to transportation issues  could negatively impact existing customer relationships resulting in decreased sales and earnings 

table of contents we rely on offshore sourcing for all of our wood and metal products  and for a significant portion of our upholstered products 
as a result  we are subject to changes in local government regulations  which could result in a decrease in sales and earnings 
changes in political  economic  and social conditions  as well as in laws and regulations in the foreign countries where we source our products could have an adverse impact on our performance 
these changes could make it more difficult to provide products and service to customers 
international trade policies of the united states and the countries from which we source finished products could adversely affect us 
imposition of trade sanctions relating to imports  taxes  import duties and other charges on imports could increase our costs and decrease our earnings 
for example beginning in  the us department of commerce has imposed tariffs on wooden bedroom furniture coming into the united states from china 
in this case  none of the rates imposed were of sufficient magnitude to alter our import strategy in any meaningful way  however  these and other tariffs are subject to review and could be increased in the future 
if demand for our domestically manufactured upholstered furniture declines and we respond by realigning manufacturing  our near term earnings could decrease 
our domestic manufacturing operations make only upholstered furniture 
a decline in demand for our domestically produced upholstered furniture could result in the realignment of domestic manufacturing operations and capabilities and the implementation of cost savings programs 
these programs could include the consolidation and integration of facilities  functions  systems and procedures 
we may decide to source certain products from offshore suppliers instead of continuing to manufacture them domestically 
these realignments and cost savings programs typically involve initial upfront costs and could result in decreases in our near term earnings before the expected cost reductions from realignment are realized 
we may not always accomplish these actions as quickly as anticipated and may not fully achieve the expected cost reductions 
fluctuations in the price  availability or quality of raw materials for our domestically manufactured upholstered furniture could cause manufacturing delays  adversely affect our ability to provide goods to our customers or increase costs  any of which could decrease our sales or earnings 
we use various types of wood  leather  fabric  foam and other filling material  high carbon spring steel  bar and wire stock and other raw materials in manufacturing upholstered furniture 
we depend on outside suppliers for raw materials and must obtain sufficient quantities of quality raw materials from these suppliers at acceptable prices and in a timely manner 
we do not have long term supply contracts with our suppliers 
unfavorable fluctuations in the price  quality or availability of required raw materials could negatively affect our ability to meet the demands of our customers 
the inability to meet customers demands could result in the loss of future sales 
we may not always be able to pass along price increases in raw materials to our customers due to competition and market pressures 
we may experience impairment of our long lived assets  which would decrease earnings and net worth 
accounting rules require that long lived assets be tested for impairment when circumstances indicate  but at least annually 
at january  we had million in net long lived assets  consisting primarily of property  plant and equipment  trademarks and trade names 
the outcome of annual impairments tests could result in the write down of all or a portion of the value of these assets 
a write down of our assets would  in turn  reduce our earnings and net worth 
over the past three fiscal years  we have written down approximately million in long lived assets 
it is possible that we will have additional write downs in the future  resulting in additional reductions to our earnings and net worth 
factors which may lead to additional write downs of our long lived assets include  but are not limited to a significant decrease in the market value of the long lived asset  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset group is being used  or in its physical condition  a significant adverse change in the legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset  including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected to acquire or construct a long lived asset  a current period operating or cash flow loss or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the long lived assets use  and a current expectation that more likely than not  a long lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 

table of contents the implementation of our enterprise resource planning system could disrupt our business and result in lower sales  earnings and net worth 
we are in the process of implementing a company wide enterprise resource planning erp system 
our erp system implementation may not result in improvements that outweigh its costs and may disrupt our operations 
our inability to mitigate existing and future disruptions could negatively affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
this implementation subjects us to substantial costs and inherent risks associated with migrating from our legacy systems 
these costs and risks include  but are not limited to significant capital and administrative expenditures  disruptions to our domestic and international supply chains  the inability to fill customer orders  the inability to process payments to suppliers  vendors and associates accurately and in a timely manner  the disruption of our internal control structure  the inability to fulfill our sec reporting requirements in a timely manner  the inability to fulfill federal and state tax filing requirements in a timely manner  and increased demands on management time to the detriment of other corporate initiatives 
we may engage in acquisitions and investments in companies  which could disrupt our business  dilute our earnings per share and decrease the value of our common stock 
we may acquire or invest in businesses that offer complementary products and that we believe offer competitive advantages 
however  we may fail to identify significant liabilities or risks that negatively affect us or result in our paying more for the acquired company or assets than they are worth 
we may also have difficulty assimilating the operations and personnel of an acquired business into our current operations 
acquisitions may disrupt or distract management from our ongoing business 
we may pay for future acquisitions using cash  stock  the assumption of debt  or a combination of these 
future acquisitions could result in dilution to existing shareholders and to earnings per share

our fiscal years end on the sunday closest to january  in some years generally once every six years the fourth quarter will be fourteen weeks long and the fiscal year will consist of fifty three weeks for example  the fiscal year that ended february  was fifty three weeks 
our quarterly periods are based on thirteen week reporting periods which end on a sunday rather than quarterly periods consisting of three calendar months 
as a result  each quarterly period generally is thirteen weeks  or days  long 

table of contents the financial statements filed as part of this annual report on form k include the fifty two week period that began february  and ended on january  fiscal  fifty two week period that began february  and ended on january  fiscal  and fifty two week period that began february  and ended on february  fiscal 
overview we have seen a growing consumer preference for lower priced  high quality imported furniture products since led by this change in consumer demand  from to we increased our focus on high quality imported home furnishings with a systematic exit from domestic wood furniture manufacturing 
as a result  we have replaced a domestic production operating model for wood furniture  which had high overhead and high fixed costs  with a low overhead  variable cost import model 
we are now focused on imported casegoods  as well as both domestically produced and imported upholstered home furnishings 
maintaining domestic upholstered furniture manufacturing allows us to offer quick turnaround on orders for custom leather and fabric upholstered seating and remains an important part of our strategy 
since the fall of  our business has been impacted by low levels of consumer confidence and a weak housing market 
by late  this malaise  exacerbated by weak credit markets  had spread to the broader us economy 
as a result  the residential home furnishings industry has seen an unprecedented decline in demand for its products 
discretionary purchases of furniture  particularly at the middle and upper middle price points where we compete  have been significantly affected by low consumer confidence 
current economic factors  such as high unemployment and difficult housing and mortgage markets  have resulted in a weak retail environment 
we believe  however  that our current business model continues to provide us with flexibility to respond to changing market conditions by adjusting inventory purchases from suppliers 
our increase in net sales for the fifty two weeks ended january   reflects a slight improvement in the retail environment for home furnishings 
following are the principal factors that impacted our results of operations during the fifty two week period ended january  net sales increased by million  or  to million during fiscal  compared to net sales of million during fiscal year net sales for our fiscal fourth quarter increased  compared to the fiscal fourth quarter  which is the third consecutive quarterly sales increase compared to the prior year periods 
gross margins for fiscal deteriorated due primarily to higher freight costs on imported products and a  charge related to a fire at one of our distribution facilities during our fiscal first quarter 
dramatic swings in shipping capacity out of asia over the last two years resulted in a percentage point variance in casegoods gross margins from the fiscal fourth quarter compared to the fiscal fourth quarter 
these higher costs were partially offset by higher margins in our upholstery division  primarily due to efficiencies resulting from increased upholstery sales 
selling and administrative expenses decreased both as a percentage of sales and in absolute terms compared to fiscal year  primarily as a result of cost cutting measures implemented during fiscal additionally  lower professional services and lower bad debts  partially offset by increased commissions and design fees  contributed to the improvement 
operating income decreased to million  or of net sales  from million or of net sales in fiscal  principally due to restructuring and asset impairment charges of million  increased freight costs on imported product and expenses related to the fire at our distribution center 
we recorded restructuring charges of million related to the consolidation of bradington young s cherryville  nc manufacturing facility and offices to hickory  nc and  related to the impairment of the our opus designs by hooker trade name during our fiscal fourth quarter

table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal for fiscal  hooker furniture reported net sales of million  an increase of million  or  compared to million in fiscal casegoods net sales increased million  or  to million during fiscal  compared to net sales of million in fiscal upholstery net sales increased million  or  to million during fiscal compared to net sales of million in fiscal these sales increases were principally due to increased unit volume across all divisions  with the upholstery division showing a increase in unit volume as compared to the prior year 
the upholstery division s unit volume increase was driven by a increase in bradington young s imported leather upholstery unit volume compared to the prior year 
overall average selling prices decreased in fiscal year compared to fiscal  due primarily to the mix of products shipped 
for fiscal  casegoods average selling prices decreased approximately and upholstery average selling prices decreased compared to fiscal domestically produced leather and upholstered furniture average selling prices decreased  while imported leather and upholstered furniture average selling prices increased compared to fiscal overall gross profit margin for fiscal decreased to of net sales compared to in fiscal casegoods margins decreased to from in the prior fiscal year primarily due to increased freight costs on imported products  and a  net charge to casegoods cost of sales for our insurance deductible related to the distribution center fire  partially offset by lower product discounting  lower returns and allowances and cost savings from the the exit from our california warehouse in upholstery margins increased to in the fiscal year  from in the fiscal year 
the margin improvements at our upholstery division were primarily due to manufacturing efficiencies due to increased production rates  and cost reduction initiatives  partially offset by higher raw material and manufacturing costs as a percentage of sales 
for fiscal  selling and administrative expenses decreased  or  to million  compared with million in the decrease in spending was principally due to the impact of cost reductions implemented in fiscal year  undertaken in response to lower sales volume  as well as lower bad debt expenses 
these decreases were partially offset by increased commissions and design fees due to increased sales 
during fiscal  we recorded million pretax million after tax  or per share in restructuring and intangible asset impairment charges related to the consolidation of bradington young s cherryville  nc manufacturing facility and offices to hickory  nc million  pretax  and  after tax or per share  and the write down of our opus designs by hooker trade name  pretax   after tax or per share

table of contents our operating income margin for fiscal decreased to million  or of net sales  compared to operating income margin of million  or of net sales for fiscal  primarily due to the aforementioned increased freight costs on imported product  restructuring and intangible asset impairment charges  and the  casualty loss charge for a warehouse fire  partially offset by improved upholstery margins and lower selling and administrative expenses 
excluding the effect of restructuring and goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges  operating profitability in fiscal still declined year over year compared to fiscal due to the other factors discussed above

these measures are not intended to reflect our overall financial results 
other income  net was  for fiscal  compared to other expense  net of  for fiscal the increase in other income was primarily the consequence of lower interest expense due to the early payoff of our term loans during fiscal we recorded income tax expense of  during fiscal  compared to  for fiscal  due primarily to a decline in pre tax income 
our effective tax rate fell to from 
the effective rate in fiscal was lower than our typical effective tax rate due to the reversal of two federal income tax penalties that had been accrued or paid in prior years  the establishment of a valuation allowance against certain state loss carry forwards that occurred last year  a smaller amount of subpart f income required to be included in income this fiscal year  a distribution from our captive insurance subsidiary  which was treated as income for financial reporting purposes but was a return of capital for tax purposes and an increase in the tax benefit related to certain officers life insurance policies 
additionally  in fiscal  the impact of permanent book tax differences resulted in a larger improvement in our effective tax rate because of the smaller amount of income compared to fiscal net income for fiscal increased to million compared to million in fiscal year 
earnings per share were for fiscal and for the prior year 
fiscal compared to fiscal for fiscal  hooker furniture reported net sales of million  a decrease of million  or  compared to million in fiscal net sales of our wood and metal furniture decreased million  or  to million during fiscal compared to net sales of million in fiscal  principally due to lower unit volume 
the decline in wood and metal furniture unit volume was attributed to a sharp decline in sales as a result of the industry wide slow down in business at retail 

table of contents unit volume decreased for hooker wood and metal furniture  bradington young domestic leather upholstery and sam moore upholstered furniture compared to fiscal unit volume increased for bradington young imported leather upholstery 
sales of imported upholstery increased less than one percent from the prior year  while domestic upholstery sales declined approximately in the same period 
these unit volume declines were partially offset by sales of our new envision product line  which was recently introduced to address the needs of a younger consumer 
overall average selling prices decreased less than two percent in the fiscal year compared to the period 
selling price increases implemented in september in response to higher costs for imported finished goods and raw materials for domestically produced upholstery were offset by aggressive discounting 
only sam moore s imported upholstered furniture showed higher average selling prices in fiscal this was primarily due to the mix of products sold 
overall gross profit margin for fiscal increased to of net sales compared to in fiscal due to margin improvements in the case goods division partially offset by lower gross margins in the upholstery operations 
wood furniture margins improved from of net sales in fiscal to of net sales in fiscal primarily due to lower shipping costs on imported wood furniture and lower warehousing costs in the case goods operation due to the elimination of a distribution facility in california  partially offset by higher discounting 
upholstery margins declined from in fiscal to in fiscal due to higher fixed operating costs as a percent of net sales resulting primarily from lower net sales in fiscal for fiscal  selling and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million  compared with million in  largely due to lower selling expense attributed to lower sales volume  reduced salaries and benefits due to staff reductions  a favorable adjustment of  to our worker s compensation accrual due to the exit from our captive insurance arrangement  and lower bonuses and severance payments than in as a percentage of net sales  selling and administrative expenses increased to in fiscal from in the fiscal period  due primarily to lower net sales 
during fiscal  we recorded million pretax  after tax  or per share in intangible asset impairment charges related to the write down of our bradington young and opus designs by hooker trade names 
during fiscal  we recorded million pretax million after tax  or per share in goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges  principally related to a write off of million in goodwill resulting from the acquisition of opus designs a write off of million in goodwill remaining from the company s purchase of bradington young in  and an impairment charge of million in the value of the bradington young trade name 
additionally  we recorded restructuring credits of  pretax  after tax  or per share in fiscal for previously accrued employee benefits and environmental remediation costs not expected to be paid 
because of the factors outlined above  our operating income margin for fiscal decreased to of net sales  compared to operating income margin of of net sales for fiscal wood furniture operating margins declined modestly from of net sales in fiscal to of net sales in fiscal  reflecting the variable cost oriented import business model  while upholstery operating loss margins worsened from of net sales to of net sales due to the impact of lower sales on the higher fixed cost structure of our domestic upholstery manufacturing facilities

other expense  net was  for fiscal  compared to other income  net of  for fiscal the decline was primarily the consequence of a decrease in interest income on cash balances from lower interest rates  partially offset by lower interest expense due to the early payoff of our term loan 
our effective tax rate increased to for fiscal  compared to for fiscal the increase was principally a result of the establishment of a valuation allowance against certain state net operating loss carryforwards  a late payment penalty and recognition of subpart f income 
the dollar amounts of the permanent benefits for officers life insurance and contributions of property were not materially different than in prior years 
their percentages are larger this year because of the smaller amount of pre tax income

our working capital ratio the relationship between our current assets and current liabilities declined slightly to at january  compared to at january  the increase in current assets was principally due to increases of million in inventories  million in net accounts receivable and million in prepaid expenses 
we increased our inventories in anticipation of increased sales and to improve service levels 
net accounts receivable increased due to higher sales 
the increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets was primarily due to increases in deferred income taxes due and increases in income taxes refundable on lower projected taxable income 
the decrease in cash reflects cash used to fund increased inventories  increased accounts receivable and higher prepaid expenses and other current assets 

table of contents the increase in current liabilities is primarily due to increases of million in accounts payable  which increased primarily due to the increased inventory purchases discussed above  and increases of million in accrued wages  salaries and benefits due to the timing of year end payrolls 
these increases were partially offset by decreases of  in other accrued expenses due to a decrease in accrued income taxes due to lower projected taxable income

enterprise resource planning during our second fiscal quarter  we began an in depth review of our current business processes and information systems and our anticipated future needs 
this review involved many of our associates from both of our divisions and spanned approximately six months 
based on this review  senior management concluded that we needed a common platform supporting and integrating our casegoods and upholstery businesses and processes 
after a significant due diligence  including numerous in depth reviews of leading enterprise resource planning erp systems and interviews with potential erp systems implementation partners  we chose an erp systems solution and implementation partner during our fiscal fourth quarter 
implementation began during our fiscal first quarter and we expect to implement the erp system at our casegoods division during our fiscal fourth quarter 
we expect implementation for our upholstery operations to occur sometime during fiscal to complete the erp system implementation as anticipated  we will be required to expend significant financial and human resources 
we anticipate spending approximately million over the course of this project  with a significant amount of time invested by our associates 
new credit agreement on december   we entered into a new credit agreement with bank of america  na the new agreement replaced our former credit agreement with the bank of america  which was scheduled to expire on march  the new agreement  which is scheduled to expire on july   includes the following terms a million unsecured revolving credit facility  up to million of which can be used to support letters of credit 
a floating interest rate  adjusted monthly  based on libor  plus an applicable margin based on the ratio of our funded debt to ebitda each as defined in the agreement  a quarterly unused commitment fee  based on our ratio of funded debt to ebitda  no pre payment penalty 

table of contents the agreement includes customary representations and warranties and requires us to comply with customary covenants  including  among other things  the following financial covenants maintain a tangible net worth of at least million  limit capital expenditures to no more than million during any fiscal year  and maintain a ratio of funded debt to ebitda not exceeding the loan agreement does not restrict our ability to pay cash dividends on  or repurchase  shares of our common stock  subject to complying with the financial covenants under the agreement 
a copy of the loan agreement was included as exhibit to the company s current report on form k  filed with the sec on december  we were in compliance with our debt covenants as of january  liquidity  financial resources and capital expenditures as of january   we had an aggregate million available under our revolving credit facility to fund working capital needs 
standby letters of credit in the aggregate amount of million  used to collateralize certain insurance arrangements and for imported product purchases  were outstanding under our revolving credit facility as of january  there were no additional borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility on january  any principal outstanding under the credit line is due july  additionally  at january  up to million was available to be borrowed against the cash surrender value of company owned life insurance policies 
we factor substantially all of our domestic upholstery accounts receivable  substantially all without recourse to us 
we factor these receivables for three primary reasons factoring allows us to outsource the administrative burden of credit and collections functions for our upholstery operations  factoring allows us to transfer the collection risk associated with the majority of our domestic upholstery receivables to the factor  and factoring provides us with an additional  potential source of short term liquidity 
we believe that we have the financial resources including available cash and cash equivalents  expected cash flow from operations  lines of credit and the cash surrender value of company owned life insurance needed to meet business requirements for the foreseeable future  including capital expenditures  and working capital  as well as to pay dividends on our common stock 
cash flow from operations is highly dependent on incoming order rates and our operating performance 
we expect to spend between million to million in capital expenditures during fiscal year to maintain and enhance our operating systems and facilities 
of these estimated amounts  we expect to spend between million to million on the aforementioned implementation of our erp system 
dividends at its april  meeting  our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share  payable on may  to shareholders of record at may  
table of contents commitments and contractual obligations as of january   our commitments and contractual obligations were as follows payments due by period in thousands less than more than year years years years total deferred compensation payments operating leases other long term obligations total contractual cash obligations these amounts represent estimated cash payments to be paid to the participants of our supplemental retirement income plan or srip through fiscal year  which is years after the last srip plan participant is assumed to have retired 
the present value of these benefits the actuarially derived projected benefit obligation for this plan is approximately million at january  and is shown on our consolidated balance sheets  with  recorded in current liabilities and million recorded in long term liabilities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page f for additional information about our srip plan 
these amounts represent estimated cash payments due under operating leases for various office equipment  warehouse equipment and real estate utilized in our operations 
see item properties  for a description of our leased real estate 
these amounts represent estimated cash payments due under various long term service and support agreements  for items such as warehouse management services  information technology support and human resources related consulting and support 
standby letters of credit in the aggregate amount of million  used to collateralize certain insurance arrangements and for imported product purchases  were outstanding under our revolving credit facility as of january  there were no additional borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit line on january  strategy and outlook our strategy is to offer world class style  quality and product value as a complete residential casegoods and upholstered furniture resource through excellence in product design  global sourcing  manufacturing  logistics  sales  marketing and customer service 
we strive to be an industry leader in sales growth and profitability performance  thereby providing an outstanding investment for our shareholders and contributing to the well being of our employees  customers  suppliers and community 
additionally  we strive to nurture the relationship focused  team oriented and honor driven corporate culture that has distinguished our company for over years 

table of contents we have been executing this strategy since in part through exiting domestic wood furniture manufacturing to concentrate on imported wood and metal and domestically produced and imported upholstered home furnishings  expanding product offerings to become a more complete and important resource to our furniture retailers through our expansion into residential upholstery through the acquisitions of upholstery manufacturers bradington young and sam moore  our expansion into youth furniture through the purchase of opus designs and by organically expanding the styles and price points offered in existing product lines  and the introduction of our envision product line in october  which was designed to meet the needs of gen x and gen y consumers and debuted on sales floors during our fiscal year first quarter  continuing to improve and expand our supply chain capabilities  with improvements in forecasting and demand planning software and stock keeping unit sku optimization  filling key leadership positions with people who have the skill sets and experience needed under our new business model  expanding service capabilities for our container direct customers by adding warehousing at five important suppliers plants in china  introducing an asian cross dock in late fiscal which is intended to provide more access to our container direct product offerings  allowing customers to order from a broader assortment of products  and implementing a corporate enterprise resource planning system which will improve operating efficiencies and help us present a single face to our customers 
the year over year declines in quarterly incoming orders  which began in the fall of  moderated substantially during our fiscal year 
fiscal orders decreased less than as compared to the fiscal year  with our upholstery division showing a increase in orders 
while we expect retail furniture conditions to remain relatively weak in fiscal  we have seen some signs of improving consumer demand 
dealer and consumer responses to our new products have been encouraging and there was an increase in attendance at our showroom at the recent fall international home furnishings market ihfm 
at the recently concluded april ihfm  we introduced three major collections on the casegoods side that were all equally well received 
we found retailers to be generally upbeat and eager to freshen their showroom floors to prepare for improving business 
we believe that the remerchandising and updating of our line over the last couple of years has helped us grow share of market and share of customer  as we ve aligned with some of the largest and healthiest retailers  who have also gained market share during the downturn 
we expect these developments will have a positive impact on our sales 
however  continuing economic uncertainty  supply chain challenges and aggressive competition for consumer discretionary dollars could adversely impact our potential recovery 
we believe that our product and business model positions us to take advantage of any upturn in the economy 
attention to cost control and improving sourced product planning  forecasting and delivery continue to be our priorities 
our new envision product line  which was designed to address the needs and tastes of gen x and gen y consumers  was introduced in october and debuted on retail sales floors during the fiscal first quarter 
while response to this new line has been encouraging  we have not yet seen an overall rebound in big ticket consumer products such as furniture  so we remain cautious in our planning and continue to take actions to address challenges to our profitability 
some of those actions include deferring  reducing or eliminating certain spending plans  continuing to refine the management of our supply chain  warehousing and distribution operations  and managing inventory levels in order to achieve an optimum balance between product availability and working capital management 
our domestic upholstery manufacturing operations have been particularly impacted by the prolonged sales downturn due to the higher fixed overhead costs for these operations 
our upholstery division reported an operating loss of of net sales for the fiscal  which is an improvement over the operating loss of of net sales for the comparable fiscal period  however  upholstery margins and profits are still disappointing 
several factors are contributing to these disappointing upholstery margins and profits  including  but not limited to manufacturing inefficiencies related to introducing new products  higher raw material costs  inefficiencies related to decreased production levels in response to reduced orders  and slower than expected savings realization from our continuous improvement initiatives 

table of contents we have responded by pursuing additional distribution channels and offering an array of new products and designs  which are generating additional sales growth 
this has included a focus on updating our upholstery lines with more contemporary offerings while retaining our best selling traditionally styled items 
in the fiscal first quarter  we began shipping the envision product line to respond to the needs of a younger consumer  a market that we believe will recover more quickly than our traditional customer base  taking actions to streamline our domestic upholstery operations  by improving efficiency and reducing overhead which has included reducing personnel  consolidating manufacturing facilities and introducing technological changes to reduce labor costs 
additionally  we have realigned upholstery division management to more intensely focus on areas of concern and continue to evaluate division efficiency  and continuing to evaluate our operating costs to better match costs to current sales volume levels by intensifying our focus on cost reduction and sales growth initiatives for our upholstery operations 
during our fiscal fourth quarter  we announced the consolidation of bradington young s cherryville  nc domestic upholstery manufacturing facility and offices into its facilities in hickory  nc  which was completed in january in connection with the consolidation  we recorded restructuring and related asset impairment charges of approximately million pretax  million after tax  or per share all in the fiscal fourth quarter as follows non cash asset impairment charges of approximately million pretax  after tax  or per share to write down the cherryville facility s real and personal property to estimated fair market value  and severance and benefit costs of approximately  pretax  after tax  or per share 
we expect to save approximately million in annual operating costs from this consolidation at bradington young  beginning in fiscal environmental matters hooker furniture is committed to protecting the environment 
as a part of our business operations  our manufacturing sites generate non hazardous and hazardous wastes  the treatment  storage  transportation and disposal of which are subject to various local  state and national laws relating to protecting the environment 
we are in various stages of investigation  remediation or monitoring of alleged or acknowledged contamination at current or former manufacturing sites for soil and groundwater contamination and visible air emissions  none of which we believe is material to our results of operations or financial position 
our policy is to record monitoring commitments and environmental liabilities when expenses are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
the costs associated with our environmental responsibilities  compliance with federal  state and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment  or costs otherwise relating to the protection of the environment  have not had and are not expected to have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations  capital expenditures or competitive position 
we participate in a voluntary industry wide environmental stewardship program referred to as enhancing furniture s environmental culture or efec 
in september of fiscal  the american home furnishings alliance granted us efec registration  recognizing the successful company wide implementation of the efec program  which includes the successful reduction of water and electricity usage  as well as recycling efforts to reduce landfill use 
critical accounting policies and estimates hooker furniture s significant accounting policies are described in note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements beginning at page f in this report 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying financial statements and related notes 
in preparing these financial statements  we have made our best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
we do not believe that actual results will deviate materially from our estimates related to our accounting policies described below 
however  because application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties  actual results could differ materially from these estimates 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts 
we evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts at the end of each quarter 
in performing this evaluation  we analyze the payment history of our significant past due accounts  subsequent cash collections on these accounts and comparative accounts receivable aging statistics 
based on this information  along with consideration of the general condition of the economy  we develop what we consider to be a reasonable estimate of the uncollectible amounts included in accounts receivable 
this estimate involves significant judgment and actual uncollectible amounts may differ materially from our estimate 
valuation of inventories 
we value all of our inventories at the lower of cost using the last in  first out lifo method or market 
lifo cost for all of our inventories is determined using the dollar value  link chain method 
this method allows for the more current cost of inventories to be reported in cost of sales  while the inventories reported on the balance sheet consist of the costs of inventories acquired earlier  subject to adjustment to the lower of cost or market 
hence  if prices are rising  the lifo method will generally lead to higher cost of sales and lower profitability as compared to the first in  first out fifo method 
we evaluate our inventory for excess or slow moving items based on recent and projected sales and order patterns 
we establish an allowance for those items when the estimated market or net sales value is lower than their recorded cost 
this estimate involves significant judgment and actual values may differ materially from our estimate 
restructuring and impairment of long lived assets tangible assets we regularly review our property  plant and equipment for indicators of impairment  as specified in the property  plant  and equipment topic of the accounting standards codification 
although not exhaustive  this accounting guidance lists potential indicators of impairment  which we use to facilitate our review 
these potential indicators of impairment include a significant decrease in the market value of the long lived asset  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset group is being used  or in its physical condition  a significant adverse change in the legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset  including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected to acquire or construct a long lived asset  a current period operating or cash flow loss or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the long lived assets use  and a current expectation that more likely than not  a long lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
the impairment test for our property  plant and equipment requires us to assess the recoverability of the value of the assets by comparing their net carrying value to the sum of undiscounted estimated future cash flows directly associated with and arising from use and eventual disposition of the assets 
we principally use our internal forecasts to estimate the undiscounted future cash flows used in our impairment analyses 
these forecasts are subjective and are largely based on management s judgment  primarily due to the changing industry in which we compete  changing consumer tastes  trends and demographics  and the current economic environment 
we monitor changes in these factors as part of the quarter end review of these assets 
while our forecasts have been reasonably accurate in the past  during periods of economic instability  uncertainty  or rapid change within our industry  we may not be able to accurately forecast future cash flows from our long lived assets and our future cash flows may be diminished 
therefore  our estimates and assumptions related to the viability of our long lived assets may change  and are reasonably likely to change in future periods 
these changes could adversely affect our consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of financial position 
as of january   the fair value of our property  plant and equipment was substantially in excess of its carrying value 
when we conclude that any of these assets is impaired  the asset is written down to its fair value 
any impaired assets that we expect to dispose of by sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value  less cost to sell  are no longer depreciated  and are reported separately as assets held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets  if we expect to dispose of the assets in one year or less 
the costs to dispose of these assets are recognized when we commit to a plan of disposal 
severance and related benefits to be paid to terminated employees affected by the facility closings are recorded in the period when management commits to a plan of termination 
we recognize liabilities for these exit and disposal activities at fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred 
asset impairment charges related to the closure of facilities are based on our best estimate of expected sales prices  less related selling expenses for assets to be sold 
the recognition of asset impairment and restructuring charges for exit and disposal activities requires significant judgment and estimates by management 
we reassess our accrual of restructuring and asset impairment charges each reporting period 
any change in estimated restructuring and related asset impairment charges is recognized in the period during which the change occurs 

table of contents intangible assets we own certain indefinite lived intangible assets related to bradington young  sam moore and opus designs by hooker 
we may acquire additional amortizable assets and or indefinite lived intangible assets in future asset purchases or business combinations 
the principal indefinite lived intangible assets are trademarks and trade names which are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible assets is determined based on the estimated earnings and cash flow capacity of those assets 
the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible assets with their carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of the indefinite lived intangible assets exceeds their fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
trade names are tested for impairment annually as of the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
circumstances that could indicate a potential impairment include  but are not limited to a significant adverse change in the economic or business climate either within the furniture industry or the national or global economy  significant changes in demand for our products  loss of key personnel  and the likelihood that a reporting unit or significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed of 
the assumptions used to determine the fair value of our intangible assets are highly subjective and judgmental and include long term growth rates  sales volumes  projected revenues  assumed royalty rates and factors used to develop an applied discount rate 
if the assumptions that we use in these calculations differ from actual results  we may realize additional impairment on our intangible assets which may have a material  adverse affect on our consolidated results of operations and consolidated balance sheets 
the fair value of our bradington young and sam moore trade names were significantly in excess of their carrying values at january  concentrations of sourcing risk we source imported products through over different vendors  from separate factories  located in seven countries 
because of the large number and diverse nature of the foreign factories from which we can source our imported products  we have some flexibility in the placement of products in any particular factory or country 
factories located in china are an important resource for hooker furniture 
in fiscal year  imported products sourced from china accounted for approximately of import purchases  and the factory in china from which we directly source the most product accounted for approximately of our worldwide purchases of imported product 
a sudden disruption in our supply chain from this factory  or from china in general  could significantly impact our ability to fill customer orders for products manufactured at that factory or in that country 
if such a disruption were to occur  we believe that we would have sufficient inventory to adequately meet demand for approximately four months 
also  with the broad spectrum of product we offer  we believe that  in some cases  buyers could be offered similar product available from alternative sources 
we believe that we could  most likely at higher cost  source most of the products currently sourced in china from factories in other countries and could produce certain upholstered products domestically at our own factories 
however  supply disruptions and delays on selected items could occur for approximately six months 
if we were to be unsuccessful in obtaining those products from other sources  or at comparable cost  then a sudden disruption in the supply chain from our largest import furniture supplier  or from china in general  could have a short term material adverse effect on our results of operations 
given the capacity available in china and other low cost producing countries  we believe the risks from these potential supply disruptions are manageable 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk hooker furniture is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  which could impact our results of operations or financial condition 
we manage our exposure to these risks through our normal operating and financing activities and  from time to time  through the use of interest rate swap agreements with respect to interest rates 
in the past  we have entered into swap agreements to hedge against the potential impact of increases in interest rates on our floating rate debt instruments 
by using swap agreements to hedge exposures to changes in interest rates  we expose ourselves to credit risk and market risk 
credit risk is the potential failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the swap agreement 
we attempt to minimize this credit risk by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties 
market risk is the potential adverse effect on the value of the swap agreement that results from a decline in interest rates 
the market risk associated with interest rate contracts is managed by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the types and degree of market risk that may be undertaken 
amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility bear interest at variable rates 
there was no outstanding balance under our revolver as of january  therefore  a fluctuation in market interest rates of one percentage point or basis points would not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
for imported products  we generally negotiate firm pricing denominated in us dollars with our foreign suppliers  typically for periods of at least one year 
we accept the exposure to exchange rate movements beyond these negotiated periods 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage this risk 
most of our imports are purchased from china 
the chinese currency now floats within a limited range in relation to the us dollar  resulting in additional exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
since we transact our imported product purchases in us dollars  a relative decline in the value of the us dollar could increase the price we pay for imported products beyond the negotiated periods 
we generally expect to reflect substantially all of the effect of any price increases from suppliers in the prices we charge for imported products 
however  these changes could adversely impact sales volume or profit margins during affected periods
