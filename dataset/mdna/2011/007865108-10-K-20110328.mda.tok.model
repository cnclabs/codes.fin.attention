table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth our results of operations expressed as a percentage of net sales 
we also use this information to evaluate the performance of our business fiscal year ended january  january  january  net sales gross profit sg a income from operations income before income taxes income taxes net income sales net sales consist of sales from comparable stores  non comparable stores  and from our e commerce business 
a store is included in comparable store sales after months of operation

occupancy costs include rent  contingent rents  common area maintenance  real estate taxes  utilities  repairs  maintenance  depreciation and amortization and impairment charges 
gross profit  as a percentage of net sales  decreased by percentage points in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease was due to lower merchandise margin of percentage points primarily resulting from higher promotional activity and markdowns compared to the prior year  higher occupancy costs of percentage points and higher depreciation costs of percentage points 
these were partially offset by lower distribution and transportation costs of percentage points 
gross profit  as a percentage of net sales  increased by percentage points in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase was due to higher merchandise margin of percentage points  and leveraging of occupancy costs of percentage points and distribution and transportation costs of percentage points 
the improvement in merchandise margin was due primarily to improved merchandise sell through and less markdowns

fiscal outlook for the balance of  our key initiatives continue to be focused in three primary areas executing on our product initiatives  enhancing processes and technology  and concentrating on our long term growth drivers 
however  we face industry wide global inflationary pressures and we believe rising product costs will reduce our overall profitability 
liquidity and capital resources our cash requirements are primarily for working capital  construction of new stores  remodeling of existing stores  and the improvement and enhancement of our information technology systems 
due to the seasonality of our business  we have historically realized a significant portion of our cash flows from operations during the second half of the year 
most recently  our cash requirements have been met primarily through cash and cash equivalents on hand during the first half of the year  and through cash flows from operations during the second half of the year 
we expect to continue to meet our cash requirements for the next twelve months primarily through cash flows from operations  existing cash and cash equivalents and  if necessary our credit facility 
at january   we had working capital of million  cash and cash equivalents of million and no debt outstanding under our million credit facility

in addition  cash used for merchandise inventories increased 
cash flows from operating activities increased by million in fiscal this increase was due to an increase in net income of million and million of additional cash generated from operating assets and liabilities 
included in operating assets and liabilities were higher income tax liabilities  due to timing of payments and higher incentive compensation liabilities 
investing activities we invested million in capital expenditures in fiscal  primarily to construct new a ropostale stores  ps from a ropostale stores  to remodel existing stores and for certain other information technology investments 
our future capital requirements will depend primarily on the number of new stores we open  the number of existing stores we remodel and other strategic investments 
in fiscal  we plan to invest approximately million in capital expenditures to open approximately a ropostale stores  approximately ps from a ropostale stores and approximately store remodels  in addition to certain information technology investments

we invested million in capital expenditures in fiscal  primarily to construct new a ropostale stores  to remodel existing stores and for certain other information technology investments 
financing activities we repurchase our common stock from time to time under a stock repurchase program 
the repurchase program may be modified or terminated by the board of directors at any time  and there is no expiration date for the program 
the extent and timing of repurchases will depend upon general business and market conditions  stock prices  opening and closing of the stock trading window  and liquidity and capital resource requirements going forward 
on november   our board of directors authorized a million increase in our share repurchase program bringing the total share repurchase program authorized to date to billion 
during fiscal  we repurchased million shares of our common stock for million  as compared to repurchases of million shares for million during fiscal and million shares for million during fiscal program to date  we repurchased million shares for million  at an average price of per share 
we have approximately million of repurchase authorization remaining as of january  under the billion share repurchase program 
we anticipate repurchasing approximately million of our common stock during fiscal 
table of contents on october   we retired million shares of our treasury stock 
these shares remain as authorized stock  however they are now considered unissued 
in accordance with asc topic  equity asc  the treasury stock retirement resulted in a reduction of the following on our consolidated balance sheet common stock by million  treasury stock by million and retained earnings by million 
there was no effect on total stockholders equity position as a result of the retirement 
we have an amended and restated revolving credit facility with bank of america  na the credit facility 
the credit facility provides for a million revolving credit line 
the credit facility is available for working capital and general corporate purposes 
loans under the credit facility are secured by all our assets and are guaranteed by the guarantors 
the credit facility is scheduled to mature on november   and no amounts were outstanding during fiscal or as of january  contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of january  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands contractual obligations real estate operating leases employment  services and separation agreements equipment operating leases total contractual obligations the real estate operating leases included in the above table do not include contingent rent based upon sales volume  which amounted to approximately of minimum lease obligations in fiscal in addition  the above table does not include variable costs paid to landlords such as maintenance  insurance and taxes  which represented approximately of minimum lease obligations in fiscal our open purchase orders are cancelable without penalty and are therefore not included in the above table 
as discussed in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements  we have a serp liability of million at january   a postretirement benefit plan liability of million at january   and a long term incentive deferred compensation plan liability of million at january  such liability amounts are not reflected in the table above 
we expect to make payments in the next months of approximately million from our serp which is included in the total serp liability of million 
our total liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits were million at january  we cannot make a reasonable estimate of the amount and timing of related future payments for these non current liabilities of million 
therefore these liabilities were not included in the above table 
there were no financial guarantees and no commercial commitments outstanding as of january  during march  we entered into employment agreements with thomas p 
johnson  our chief executive officer and michael j 
cunningham  our president 
in addition  we entered into a services agreement with julian r 
geiger  our chairman 
these agreements were effective december during december  we entered into a separation agreement with mindy c 
meads  our former co chief executive officer 
the total contractual commitment for all of these agreements combined is million as of january  the table above reflects the aforementioned agreements included in employment  services and separation agreements 
off balance sheet arrangements other than operating lease commitments set forth in the table above  we are not a party to any material off balance sheet financing arrangements 
we have not created  and are not a party to  any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital  incurring debt or operating our business 
we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of capital resources 
as of january   we have not issued any letters of credit for the purchase of merchandise inventory or any capital expenditures 

table of contents critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements 
these estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
estimates by their nature are based on judgments and available information 
therefore  actual results could materially differ from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and the results of operations and require management most difficult  subjective and complex judgments as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our most critical accounting policies have been discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in applying such policies  management must use significant estimates that are based on its informed judgment 
because of the uncertainty inherent in these estimates  actual results could differ from estimates used in applying the critical accounting policies 
changes in such estimates  based on more accurate future information  may affect amounts reported in future periods 
merchandise inventory merchandise inventory consists of finished goods and is valued utilizing the cost method at lower of cost or market on a weighted average basis 
we use estimates during interim periods to record a provision for inventory shortage 
we also make certain assumptions regarding future demand and net realizable selling price in order to assess that our inventory is recorded properly at the lower of cost or market 
these assumptions are based on both historical experience and current information 
we believe that the carrying value of merchandise inventory is appropriate as of january  however  actual results may differ materially from those estimated and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
for example  a difference in our estimate of inventory at the lower of cost or market as of january  would have impacted net income by million for the fiscal year ended january  income taxes income taxes are accounted for in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  income taxes asc 
under asc  income taxes are recognized for the amount of taxes payable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequence of events that have been recognized differently in the financial statements than for tax purposes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are established using statutory tax rates and are adjusted for tax rate changes 
we consider accounting for income taxes critical to our operations because management is required to make significant subjective judgments in developing our provision for income taxes  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowances that may be required against deferred tax assets 
asc clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income tax recognized in an entity s financial statements and requires companies to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities before any part of the benefit can be recorded in the financial statements 
for those tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  no tax benefit is recognized 
where applicable  associated interest and penalties are also recorded 
this interpretation also provides guidance on de recognition  classification  accounting in interim periods  and expanded disclosure requirements see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
long lived assets we periodically evaluate the need to recognize impairment losses relating to long lived assets 
long lived assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset may have been impaired 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant changes in the manner of our use of assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  store closings  or under performing business trends 

table of contents in evaluating an asset for recoverability  we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
management makes assumptions and applies judgment to estimate future cash flows 
these assumptions include factors such as historical and forecasted results and trends 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset  we would write the asset down to fair value and we would record an impairment charge 
additionally  we have recorded store impairment charges of million for one store in fiscal compared to million for six stores in fiscal and million for stores in fiscal  which were included in depreciation and amortization expense  which is a component of cost of sales see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion 
we believe that the carrying values of finite lived assets  and their useful lives  are appropriate as of january  however  actual results may differ materially from those estimated and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
defined benefit retirement plan we maintain a serp  which is a non qualified defined benefit plan for certain officers 
the plan is non contributory  is not funded and provides benefits based on years of service and compensation during employment 
pension expense is determined using various actuarial cost methods to estimate the total benefits ultimately payable to officers  and this cost is allocated to service periods 
the actuarial assumptions used to calculate pension costs are reviewed annually 
we believe that these assumptions have been appropriate and that  based on these assumptions  the serp current liability of million and serp non current liability of million are appropriately stated as of january  however  actual results may differ from those estimated and could have an impact on our consolidated financial statements in the future 
for example  if we had changed the expected discount rate by in fiscal  pension expense would have changed by less than  recent accounting developments see the section recent accounting developments included in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting developments and their impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of january   we had no outstanding borrowings under our credit facility 
in addition  we had no stand by or commercial letters of credit issued under the credit facility 
to the extent that we may borrow pursuant to the credit facility in the future  we may be exposed to market risk related to interest rate fluctuations 
unrealized foreign currency gains and losses  resulting from the translation of our canadian subsidiary s financial statements into our us dollar reporting currency are reflected in the equity section of our consolidated balance sheet in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
the balance of the unrealized gain included in accumulated other comprehensive loss was million as of january  a movement in quoted foreign currency exchange rates could result in a fair value translation fluctuation of approximately million  which would be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss as an unrealized gain or loss 
we also face transactional currency exposures relating to merchandise that our canadian subsidiary purchases using us dollars 
these foreign currency transaction gains and losses are charged or credited to earnings as incurred 
we do not hedge our exposure to this currency exchange fluctuation  and transaction gains and losses to date have not been significant
