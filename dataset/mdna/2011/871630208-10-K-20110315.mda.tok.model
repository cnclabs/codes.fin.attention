construction and operations of plants based on the syntroleum technologies will be subject to risks of delay and cost overruns 
the construction and operation of plants based on the syntroleum technologies will be subject to the risks of delay or cost overruns resulting from numerous factors 
delays in construction or operation of the plant could directly impact the capital expenditure budget or working capital budget 
increases in these costs could result in increased equity payments from parent companies 
we need to remain listed on the nasdaq stock market to be able to access adequate funding from time to time 
we could face de listing issues that would impair the liquidity of our stock and our availability to access the capital markets 
we are required to maintain standards for listing of our common stock on the nasdaq stock market  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so 
we can make no assurance that we will be able to remain listed on the nasdaq stock market 
we have incurred losses 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
because we do not have an operating history upon which an evaluation of our prospects can be based  our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by small companies seeking to develop new and rapidly evolving technologies 
to address these risks we must  among other things  continue to attract investment capital  respond to competitive factors  continue to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel and commercialize our technologies 
we may not be successful in addressing these risks  and we may not achieve or sustain profitability 
our anticipated expense levels are based in part on our expectations as to future operating activities and not on historical financial data 
we plan to continue funding project development activities 
capital expenditures will depend on progress we make in developing various projects on which we are currently working 
increased revenues or cash flows may not result from these expenses 

table of contents if prices or margins for crude oil  natural gas  coal  vegetable oils and fats and other commodities are unfavorable  plants based on the syntroleum technologies may not be economical 
because the products from plants utilizing the syntroleum technologies are expected to compete in markets with conventional petroleum products  an increase in alternative feedstock prices relative to prices for oil  or a decrease in prices for oil relative to alternative feedstock prices  could adversely affect the operating results of these plants 
higher than anticipated costs for the catalysts and other materials used in these plants could also adversely affect operating results 
factors that could cause changes in the prices and availability of oil  natural gas  coal  biomass  fats  vegetable oils and refined products include changes in supply and demand balance of feedstocks and refined products  weather conditions  domestic and foreign government regulation  actions of the organization of petroleum exporting countries  political conditions in countries producing feedstocks  supply of crude oil  natural gas  coal  biomass fats  greases and vegetable oils  location of gtl plants relative to natural gas reserves and pipelines  location of ctl plants relative to coal reserves and transportation systems  location of btl plants relative to biomass reserves and transportation systems  capacities of pipelines  fluctuations in seasonal demand  crop yields  seasonality of prices for feedstocks and refined products  farmer planting decisions  output and proximity of crush facilities that convert the crops to oils  alternative uses for fats  number of animals slaughtered and rendered  price and availability of alternative fuels  and overall economic conditions 
our success depends on the performance of our executive officers and key personnel  the loss of who would disrupt our business operations 
we depend to a large extent on the performance of our executive officers  edward g 
roth  our chief executive officer  karen l 
gallagher  our senior vice president of finance and principal financial officer  and certain key personnel 
our ability to implement our business strategy may be constrained and the timing of implementation may be impacted if we are unable to attract and retain sufficient personnel 
at december   we had full time employees 
we do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our employees 
we have entered into employment agreements with several key employees 
we depend on strategic relationships with feedstock suppliers  construction contractors  site owners  manufacturing and engineering companies  and customers 
if we are not successful in entering into and achieving the benefits of these relationships  this could negatively impact our business 
our or our licensee s ability to identify and enter into commercial arrangements with feedstock suppliers  construction contractors  engineering service companies  site owners  manufacturing and engineering companies  and customers will depend on developing and maintaining close working relationships with industry participants 
our success in this area will also depend on our ability to select and evaluate suitable projects  as well as to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment 
these relationships may take the form of joint ventures with other private parties or local government bodies  contractual arrangements with other companies  including those that supply feedstock that we will use in our business  or minority investments from third parties 
there can be no assurances that our licensees or we will be able to establish these strategic relationships  or  if established  that the relationships will be maintained 
in addition  the dynamics of our relationships with strategic participants may require us to incur expenses or undertake activities we would not otherwise be inclined to incur or undertake in order to fulfill our obligations to these partners or maintain these relationships 
if we do not successfully establish or maintain strategic relationships  our business may be negatively affected 

table of contents our operating results may be volatile due to a variety of factors and are not a meaningful indicator of future performance 
we expect to experience significant fluctuations in future annual and quarterly operating results because of the unpredictability of many factors that impact our business 
these factors include timing of any construction by us or our licensees of plants  demand for licenses or other technology transfer agreements of the syntroleum technologies and receipt and revenue recognition of license fees  volatile price of commodities used and produced  introduction or enhancement of ft and renewable fuels technologies by us and our competitors  market acceptance of new technologies  and general economic conditions 
as a result  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as any indication of future performance 
due to all of the foregoing factors  it may be that in some future year or quarter our operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in that event  the price of our common stock would likely be materially adversely affected 
we are subject to extensive laws relating to the protection of the environment  and these laws may increase the cost of designing  constructing and operating our plants based on the syntroleum technologies or affect demand for the products of these plants 
if we violate any of the laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment  we may be subject to substantial fines  criminal sanctions or third party lawsuits and may be required to install costly pollution control equipment or  in some extreme cases  curtail operations 
our ft and renewable fuels plants will generally be required to obtain permits under applicable environmental laws and various permits for industrial siting and construction 
compliance with environmental laws and regulations  as well as with any requisite environmental or construction permits  may increase the costs of designing  constructing and operating our plants 
we may also face exposure to actual or potential claims and lawsuits involving environmental matters with respect to our previously owned real estate 
changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently  and any changes may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  competitive position  or financial condition 
for instance  in response to studies suggesting that emissions of certain gases  commonly referred to as greenhouse gases and including carbon dioxide and methane  may be contributing to warming of the earth s atmosphere  the us congress is actively considering legislation  and more than a dozen states have already taken legal measures to reduce emission of these gases  primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories and or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs 
new legislation or regulatory programs that restrict emissions of greenhouse gases could have an adverse affect on our operations 
terrorist threats and us military actions could result in a material adverse effect on our business 
further acts of terrorism in the united states or elsewhere could occur 
these developments and similar future events may cause instability in the world s financial and insurance markets and could significantly increase political and economic instability in the geographic areas in which we may wish to operate 
these developments could also lead to increased volatility in prices for crude oil  natural gas and the feedstocks for our plants and the cost and availability of insurance 
in addition  these developments could adversely affect our ability to access capital and to successfully implement projects currently under development 
united states government regulations effectively preclude us from actively engaging in business activities in certain countries 
these regulations could be expanded to cover countries where we may wish to operate in the future 
these developments could subject the operations of our company to increased risks and  depending on their magnitude  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we may not have enough insurance to cover all of the risks we face 
in accordance with customary industry practices  we maintain insurance coverage against some  but not all  potential losses in order to protect against the risks we face 
we do not carry a significant amount of business interruption insurance 
we may elect not to carry insurance if our management believes that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented 
in addition  we cannot insure fully against pollution and environmental risks 
the occurrence of an event not fully covered by insurance  such as a leak  fire or explosion could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations

operations to date have consisted of activities related to the commercialization of a proprietary process the syntroleum process and previously consisted of research and development of the syntroleum process designed to convert carbonaceous material biomass  coal  natural gas and petroleum coke into synthetic liquid hydrocarbons 
synthetic hydrocarbons produced by the syntroleum process can be further processed using the syntroleum synfining process into high quality liquid fuels  such as diesel  jet fuel hrj  subject to certification  kerosene  naphtha  propane and other renewable chemical products 
our bio synfining technology is a renewable fuels application of our synfining technology 
this technology is applied commercially via our dynamic fuels  llc joint venture with tyson foods  inc the technology processes renewable feedstocks such as triglycerides and or fatty acids to make renewable synthetic products 
operating revenues during the periods discussed below  our revenues were primarily generated from the sale or transfer of our technology  technical services revenue from engineering and sales of products for testing purposes 
in the future  we expect to receive revenue from engineering technical services  royalties and other income from our jointly owned subsidiary dynamic fuels  sales and licensing of our technologies and product sales or royalties for the use of gtl  btl and ctl plants in which we will own an equity interest 
until the commencement of full rate commercial operation of dynamic fuels  we expect that cash flow relating to our syntroleum technologies will consist primarily of revenues associated with technical services and sales and licensing of our technology 
upon full rate commercial operations of the dynamic fuels facility and adequate working capital  we may receive royalty fees based on the production of the facility 
we expect to achieve full rate operations in the second quarter of we also expect to receive additional profits from the operations of the facility based on our proportionate equity ownership of the plant 
we may receive revenues associated with the sale of the use of our technology to certain customers with limited rights in certain geographic areas 
our future operating revenues and investments in projects will depend on the successful commercial operation of the dynamic fuels facility or other gtl  btl or ctl plants based on the syntroleum process  the success of competing gtl technologies  and other competing uses for natural gas  biomass or coal 
we expect our results of operations and cash flows to be affected by changing crude oil  natural gas  oils  animal fats  fuel and specialty product prices and trends in environmental regulations 
if the price of these products increase decrease  there could be a corresponding increase decrease in operating revenues 

table of contents we continue to incur operating expenses with respect to commercializing our syntroleum technologies and do not anticipate recognizing any significant revenue production from the dynamic fuels bio synfining facility until the second half of operating expenses our operating expenses historically have consisted primarily of engineering  including third party engineering and general and administrative expenses  which include costs associated with general corporate overhead  compensation expense  legal and accounting expenses and expenses associated with other related administrative functions 
we have also recognized depreciation and amortization expense related to office and computer equipment  leasehold improvements and patents 
we have reduced our costs and expenses over the past three years with the completion of our research and development efforts related to running the cdf and pilot plant 
operating costs declined as a result of suspending operations at plants  reducing our workforce and focusing on cost minimization 
our current workforce consists of engineers and general and administrative employees 
the implementation of these cost saving measures had a significant favorable impact on our operating expenses 
we have incurred costs related specifically to the development and design of the bio synfining and syntroleum process 
these costs  which relate primarily to engineers and outside contract services for initial engineering  design  and development  are included in engineering costs in our consolidated statements of operations 
we have invested million of cash into our dynamic fuels bio synfining plant in which we own an interest for our portion of start up and capital expenditures  including working capital for our share of the engineering design  construction and start up of the plant 
we have incurred our share of initial working capital which includes expenses relating primarily to the cost of feedstocks for the plant and operating expenses relating to the plant  including labor  consumables and product marketing costs 
commercial and licensee projects on june   we entered into definitive agreements with tyson to form dynamic fuels  to construct and operate facilities in the united states using our bio synfining technology 
dynamic fuels is organized and operated pursuant to the provisions of its limited liability company agreement between the company and tyson the llc agreement 
the llc agreement provides for management and control of dynamic fuels to be exercised jointly by representatives of the company and tyson equally with no llc member exercising control 
this entity is accounted for under the equity method and is not required to be consolidated in our financial statements  however  our share of the dynamic fuels net income or loss is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations 
dynamic fuels has a different fiscal year than us 
the dynamic fuels fiscal year ends on september and we report our share of dynamic fuels results of operations on a three month lag basis 
our carrying value in dynamic fuels is reflected in investment in and loans to dynamic fuels llc in our consolidated balance sheets 
as of december   syntroleum s total estimate of maximum exposure to loss as a result of its relationships with this entity was approximately  which represents our equity investment in and loans to this entity 
dynamic fuels was initially capitalized on july  with million in capital contributions from tyson and million in capital contributions from us 
each member contributed an additional million in capital contributions by december  each member contributed an additional million in the form of a working capital loan to the entity 
the loan will be repaid to each member upon dynamic fuels generating sufficient working capital from fuel sales 
dynamic fuels began commercial operations in november of the plant has achieved full rate production levels  but not on a continuous basis 
as of february   the plant has produced and sold million gallons of renewable diesel and million gallons of renewable naphtha 
the plant also produced  gallons of renewable jet fuel  which is being tested by the us military 
full rate capacity for the plant is  barrels per day 
we expect to achieve full rate capacity on a continuous basis in the second quarter of 
table of contents diesel is quality tested and meets astm d standards for diesel 
the renewable products have low emissions and nearly no aromatics 
our jet fuel hrj  meets all petroleum based jet fuel specifications 
we are awaiting certification of hrj jet fuel for a blend for use in aviation 
we expect it to occur in the first half of  thus allowing us to market our jet fuel production capabilities to interested parties 
the production of our fuel is eligible for the tax credit per gallon of renewable diesel and per gallon of renewable naphtha under the energy independence act and energy policy act of our fuel also generates rin s per gallon 
rin prices have increased in recent months due to the government mandated demand for million gallons of biomass based diesel to be consumed by refiners in as of march   rin prices are per gallon and therefore worth per gallon with the multiplier 
our fuel can be sold with the rin premium included in our price of fuel 
we have the ability to produce various renewable specialty chemical products with higher margins that are not dependent on government subsidies or mandates 
we are actively researching and marketing to these specialty chemical markets 
on october   dynamic fuels issued tax exempt bonds through the louisiana public facilities authority in the amount of million at an initial interest rate of to fund construction of the plant 
the bonds required a letter of credit in the amount of million as collateral for dynamic fuels obligations under the bonds 
tyson agreed under the terms of the warrant agreement to provide credit support for the entire million bond issue 
the interest rate for the bonds is a daily floating interest rate and may change significantly from this amount 
in the fourth quarter of  dynamic fuels entered into an interest rate swap  which had the effect of locking in the interest rate at for a period of years with declining swap coverage 
this debt funding is in addition to the equity contributions and loans provided by each member 
discontinued operations research and development in  we determined we had completed the research and development activities necessary to validate our technology 
all of these research and development expenses were associated with the development of our syntroleum process 
we decided to focus on the commercialization of our technologies to produce synthetic liquid hydrocarbons 
results of operations consolidated results for the years ended december revenues in thousands technology revenue technical services revenue technical services revenue from dynamic fuels other revenue total revenues technology revenue 
technology revenue was  for the year ended december  and relates to the delivery of technology equipment related to our transfer of technology sale that occurred in technology agreements will be unique to individual customers 
revenue recognition will be determined on an individual contract basis 
we are actively pursuing other agreements 
due to the complexity and due diligence requirements of these agreements  the business development requirements typically span current year timing 
technical services revenue 
revenues from engineering services for dynamic and other engineering services remained relatively the same in as compared to it increased in compared to revenues 
this increase is attributable to increased technical services contracts related to certain technology revenue agreements and continued work on the engineering design and project management of dynamic fuels 
revenue from dynamic fuels is expected to be significantly less in as the project is complete and the plant is operational and will need limited licensor work 
we expect to continue to earn revenues for engineering services provided to other customers on an individual contract basis in other revenue 
there were no other revenues in the year ended december  the revenue in consisted of gtl fuel sales and recognition of revenue for the completion of the second and third milestone for our work with testing gallons of renewable jet fuel with the dod in the amount of  in we do not expect to recognize future revenues from this revenue source 
operating costs and expenses in thousands engineering depreciation and amortization non cash equity compensation general and administrative and other total operating costs and expenses 
table of contents engineering expense 
the decrease in expenditures in compared to and is a result of decreased engineering headcount and increased bonus compensation granted and expensed in for the execution and delivery of technology document agreements 
non cash equity compensation 
equity compensation expense for the vesting of stock compensation awards to employees decreased in compared to and these changes in expense primarily relate to the vesting schedule of performance based awards granted to all employees in the vesting of these awards is based on achieving certain milestones associated with the bio synfining technology project 
a majority of the expense associated with these awards was recognized in and we expect to recognize the remaining amount of equity compensation for the milestone based awards in  but we do not expect such additional equity compensation expense to be significant and will not have significant equity compensation expense for the remainder of  unless new awards are granted 
general and administrative and other 
general and administrative expenses decreased significantly in compared to and the decrease primarily relates to bonus compensation granted in for the execution and delivery of technology document agreements and decreased legal fees due to settlement of litigation  offset by the non cash expense of legal fees from prior years on abandoned patents and cash settlements 
in expenses were higher due to legal fees associated with litigation 
other income and expenses in thousands interest income other income loss in equity of dynamic fuels  llc foreign currency exchange income taxes income loss from discontinued operations interest income

loss in equity of dynamic fuels  llc 
our share of dynamic fuels loss for its year ended september  increased due to initial start up operating expenditures 
expenditures incurred for dynamic s year ended september  includes site rent  project development  equipment evaluation and labor expenditures for operations staff for months 
in anticipation of plant operation in  operating expenditures incurred for dynamic fuels total approximately  for the twelve months ended september  we expect to see income from this investment in upon full rate commercial operations 
we report our percent share of dynamic fuels results of operations on a three month lag basis 
foreign currency exchange 
changes in the foreign currency exchange are due to fluctuation in the value of the australian dollar compared to the us dollar 
the foreign currency changes result from translation adjustments from our license with the commonwealth of australia which is denominated in australian dollars 
these changes have no current cash impact on us 
income loss from discontinued operations 
changes in income from discontinued operation primarily resulted from lower than expected dismantlement costs in resulting in a gain from reducing our asset retirement liability associated with the catoosa demonstration facility to the increase in results from proceeds received in the amount of  from the settlement of future payments associated with our international oil and gas assets in we will not incur further expenses related to our oil and gas activities in the future 
liquidity and capital resources general as of december   we had  in cash and cash equivalents

we believe that all of the receivables currently outstanding will be collected and have not established a reserve for bad debts 

table of contents our current liabilities totaled  as of december  our business plan over the next several years includes potential investments in additional plants and we will need to raise capital to accomplish this plan 
we expect to obtain funding through debt or equity financing  joint ventures  license agreements and other strategic alliances 
if we obtain additional funds by issuing equity  dilution to stockholders may occur 
in addition  preferred stock could be issued without stockholder approval  and the terms of our preferred stock could include dividend  liquidation  conversion  voting and other rights that are more favorable than the rights of the holders of our common stock 
there can be no assurance as to the availability or terms upon which such financing might be available

new accounting pronouncements in october of the fasb issued guidance that addresses the accounting for multiple deliverable arrangements complex contract or related contracts that require the separate delivery of multiple goods and or services by expanding the circumstances in which vendors may account for deliverables separately rather than as a combined unit 
this update clarifies the guidance on how to separate such deliverables and how to measure and allocate consideration for these arrangements to one or more units of accounting 
the existing guidance requires a vendor to use vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence of selling price to separate deliverables in multiple deliverable arrangements 
in addition to retaining this guidance  in situations where vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence is not available  the guidance will require a vendor to allocate arrangement consideration to each deliverable in multiple deliverable arrangements based on each deliverable s relative selling price 
this update also expands disclosure requirements for multiple deliverable arrangements  can be applied either prospectively or retrospectively  and is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june   with early adoption permitted 
we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
in july of the fasb issued guidance that addresses additional required disclosures about recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements under topic  fair value measurements 
the asu requires certain new disclosures and clarifies two existing disclosure requirements 
the new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosures are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements in the roll forward activity in level fair value measurements 
those disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our financial positions and results of operations 
in april of the fasb issued guidance on defining a milestone under topic and determining when it may be appropriate to apply the milestone method of revenue recognition for research and development transactions 
consideration that is contingent on achievement of a milestone in its entirety may be recognized as revenue in the period in which the milestone is achieved only if the milestone is judged to meet certain criteria to be considered substantive 
milestones should be considered substantive in their entirety and may not be bifurcated 
this update is effective on a prospective basis for milestones achieved in fiscal years beginning on or after june   with early adoption permitted 
we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and use assumptions that affect reported amounts 
we believe that the following items represent our critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues from technical services provided as time and expenses for services or support associated with a contract or license as incurred 
the license agreements require us to develop a technology design and other technical services in accordance with licensee specifications  this design package is called the process design package  or pdp 
the preparation of our pdp includes engineering labor and necessary materials for completion of the package 
we recognized revenues from the transfer of technology documentation to customers or through licensing structures 
any deposits or advance payments for the technology documentation is recorded as deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheets until recognized as revenue in the consolidated statement of operations 
the company recognizes revenue on the transfer of technology documentation upon the physical transfer of the technology documentation by the company to the customer pursuant to the terms of the specific agreement 
license fee deposits received as cash upon the sale of master volume or regional license agreements are recorded as deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheets until recognized as revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 
we recognize revenue on the sale of license agreements by recording percent of the license fee deposit as revenue when a site license agreement has been formally executed  the license fee deposit has been paid in cash and delivery to the licensee the pdp for the licensee s initial plant 
since percent of the license fee deposit is subject to our indemnity obligation with respect to the performance guarantee on the related plant  the remaining license fee deposit will be recognized as revenue in the consolidated statement of operations after the related plant has passed certain performance tests 
option fees  which provide licensees the right to include additional geographic areas in its license agreement territory  are deferred until the earlier of the option being exercised or lapsing 
the license agreements currently allow us to use our own engineering staff or to work with outside engineering contractors to develop a site specific plant design in accordance with licensee specifications  this design package is called the pdp 
to date  we have not delivered any pdp s for initial licensed plants  except for the dynamic fuels plant  which we are part owner of and no initial license fee deposits are required 
we are under no obligation to return these deferred revenues except in the case when a licensee builds a plant and the plant does not pass certain performance tests 
in this situation  the licensee would be able to receive a refund of percent of the license fees paid 
the license agreements have a year life and  after this time  the deferred revenue will be recorded as license revenue in the statements of operations unless a site license has been executed 
our current licenses generally begin to expire in and the initial deposits will be recognized as licensing revenue as the licenses expire should the licensee not purchase a site license and begin construction of a plant prior to expiration of the license 
we have not received additional funds under these license agreements during the license period and do not expect to receive additional funds under these license agreements 
we are currently pursuing different avenues for the sale of technology rights  via equity ownership or sale or transfer of technology  and have not entered into this type of license agreement since 
table of contents preparation of the pdp can take varying amounts of time depending on the size of the project and could take a period of time  ranging six months to two years from notice to proceed 
construction time will depend on the size of the project  site location conditions and the availability of construction services  necessary materials and labor 
current estimates for construction times for large capital projects in excess of one billion dollars in costs are from three to five years from completion of the front end engineering design 
we expect to recognize revenue for royalty fees associated with our licensees plants or our own equity owned plants 
the royalties  if applicable  will be recognized upon production of finished product by the licensee 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with fasb asc topic  compensation stock compensation 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the applicable vesting period of the stock award generally three years using the straight line method 
non employee stock based compensation 
we also grant stock based incentives to certain non employees 
these stock based incentives are accounted for in accordance with fasb asc topic  compensation stock compensation 
stock awards that are tied to performance criteria are expensed at the time the performance goals are met 
asset retirement obligations 
we follow fasb asc topic  asset retirement and environmental obligations  which requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred and a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
the standard requires that we record the discounted fair value of the retirement obligation as a liability at the time the plants are constructed 
the asset retirement obligations consist primarily of costs associated with the future plant dismantlement of our pilot plants 
as the pilot plants are directly related to research and development activities and have been expensed accordingly  no corresponding amount is capitalized as part of the related property s carrying amount 
the liability accretes over time with a charge to accretion expense 
critical estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
some of the more significant estimates made by management include  but are not limited to  the valuation of stock based compensation  estimates for accrued liabilities and estimates for asset retirement obligations 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk margins for crude oil  natural gas  coal  vegetable oils and fats and other commodities create a market risk for economics associated with our syntroleum technologies 
because the synthetic crude oil  liquid fuels and specialty products that plants utilizing the syntroleum technologies are expected to produce will compete in markets with oil and refined petroleum products  and because natural gas  coal  biomass  fats or vegetable oils will be used as the feedstock for these plants  an increase in feedstock prices relative to prices for oil or refined products  or a decrease in prices for oil or refined products relative to feedstock prices  could adversely affect the operating results of these plants 
higher than anticipated costs for the catalysts and other materials used in these plants could also adversely affect operating results 
prices for oil  natural gas  coal  biomass  fats  greases  vegetable oils and refined products are subject to wide fluctuation in response to relatively minor changes in the supply and demand  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control 
we expect that we will need to raise substantial additional capital to accomplish our business plan over the next several years 
we expect to obtain additional funding through debt or equity financing in the capital markets  joint ventures  license agreements  sale of assets and other strategic alliances  as well as various other financing arrangements 
if we obtain additional funds by issuing equity securities  dilution to stockholders may occur 
in addition  preferred stock could be issued in the future without stockholder approval  and the terms of our preferred stock could include dividend  liquidation  conversion  voting and other rights that are more favorable than the rights of the holders of our common stock 
there can be no assurance as to the availability or terms upon which such financing and capital might be available
