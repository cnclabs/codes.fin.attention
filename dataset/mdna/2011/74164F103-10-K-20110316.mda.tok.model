table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion may contain forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties 
see forward looking statements at the beginning of this annual report on form k 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including certain risks inherent with our business as discussed in item a risk factors 
primoris is a holding company of various subsidiaries  which form one of the largest specialty contractors and infrastructure companies in the united states 
serving diverse end markets  primoris provides a wide range of construction  fabrication  maintenance  replacement  water and wastewater  and engineering services to major public utilities  petrochemical companies  energy companies  municipalities  and other customers 
with our acquisitions of jcg in december and rockford in november  primoris has doubled its size and the company s national footprint now extends from florida  along the gulf coast  through california  into the pacific northwest and canada

through our subsidiary onquest  inc  we provide engineering and design services for fired heaters and furnaces primarily used in refinery applications 
through our subsidiary cardinal contractors  inc  we construct water and wastewater facilities in florida 
on december   the company completed the acquisition of jcg 
jcg is one of the largest general contractors based in the gulf coast states  and is engaged in highway  industrial and environmental construction  primarily in louisiana  texas and florida 
jcg is the successor company to t 
l 
james and company  inc  a well known louisiana company and has been in business for over years 
headquartered in baton rouge  louisiana  jcg serves government and private clients in a broad geographical region that includes the entire gulf coast region of the united states 
jcg s heavy civil division provides services in heavy civil construction projects  including highway and bridge construction  concrete paving  levee construction  airport runway and taxiway construction and marine facility construction

jcg s industrial division  with a client base comprised primarily of private industrial companies  provides all phases of civil and structural construction  mechanical equipment erection  process pipe installation and boiler  furnace and heater installation and repair 
on november   the company entered into the rockford agreement to acquire privately held rockford 
upon completion of the acquisition on november   rockford became a wholly owned subsidiary 
based in hillsboro portland  oregon  rockford specializes in large diameter natural gas and liquid pipeline projects and related facilities construction 
the rockford agreement provided that the transaction was effective retroactive to october  rockford s business adds to the company s major underground project bidding and performance capabilities 
rockford also adds to our california underground capacity and provides a northwest united states location to expand the company s geographic presence 
as discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form k  on july   we completed a merger of rhapsody acquisition corp 
and former primoris 
the july merger was accounted for as a reverse acquisition 
under this method of accounting  rhapsody was treated as the acquired company for financial reporting purposes 
this determination was primarily based on the operations and management of former primoris comprising the ongoing operations and management of the company after the merger 
in accordance with guidance applicable to these circumstances  the merger was considered to be a capital transaction in substance 
accordingly  for accounting purposes  the merger was treated as the equivalent of former primoris issuing stock for our net assets  accompanied by a recapitalization 
our pre merger net assets are stated at historical cost  with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded 

table of contents prior to january   the company reported two operating segments the construction services segment and the engineering segment 
as a result of the acquisition of jcg and changes in our management structure  the company changed the reportable operating segments on january   by separating the former construction services segment into two separate segments 
the prior year information for the construction services segment has been reclassified into the new segments 
the three new segments are east construction services  west construction services and engineering 
range of services east and west construction services both the east construction services and the west construction services segments specialize in a range of services that include designing  building installing  replacing  repairing rehabilitating and providing management services for construction related projects 
our services include providing installation of underground pipeline  cable and conduits for entities in the petroleum  petrochemical and water industries  providing installation and maintenance of industrial facilities for entities in the petroleum  petrochemical and water industries  providing installation of complex commercial and industrial cast in place structures  and providing construction of highways and industrial and environmental construction 
east construction services the east construction services segment incorporates the jcg construction business  located primarily in the southeastern united states 
the segment also includes the businesses located in the gulf coast region of the united states that were formerly included in the construction services segment  including cardinal contractors  inc  cardinal mechanical  lp and cravens 
west construction services the west construction services segment includes the construction services performed in the western united states  primarily in the state of california 
entities included in west construction services are arb inc  arb structures  inc 
and stellaris  llc 
additionally  the results of the november  acquisition of rockford  effective on november   are included in the west construction services segment 
engineering the engineering segment remained unchanged and includes the results of onquest  inc and born heaters canada  ulc 
the engineering group specializes in designing  supplying  and installing high performance furnaces  heaters  burner management systems  and related combustion and process technologies for clients in the oil refining  petrochemical  and power generation industries 
it furnishes turnkey project management with technical expertise and the ability to deliver custom engineering solutions worldwide 
material trends and uncertainties we generate our revenue from both large and small construction and engineering projects 
the award of these contracts is dependent on a number of factors  many of which are not within our control 
business in the construction industry is cyclical 
we depend in part on spending by companies in the energy  and oil and gas industries  as well as on municipal water and wastewater customers 
over the past several years  each segment has benefited from demand for more efficient and more environmentally friendly energy and power facilities  local highway and bridge needs and from the strength of the oil and gas industry 
economic factors outside of our control may affect the amount and size of contracts in any particular period 
we and our customers are operating in a challenging business environment in light of the economic downturn and weak capital markets 
we are closely monitoring our customers and the effect that changes in economic and market conditions may have on them 
we have experienced reduced spending by our customers throughout and  
table of contents which we attribute to negative economic and market conditions  and we anticipate that these negative conditions will continue to affect demand for our services in the near term until conditions improve 
however  we believe that most of our customers  some of whom are regulated utilities  remain financially stable in general and will be able to continue with their business plans in the long term without substantial constraints 
seasonality and cyclicality our results of operations can be subject to quarterly variations 
some of the variation is the result of weather  particularly rain  which can impact primoris ability to perform construction services 
since the majority of the company s work is in the southern half of the united states  these seasonal impacts are not as dramatic for the company as may be experienced by companies in some other states 
in addition  demand for new projects can be lower during the early part of the year due to clients internal budget cycles 
as a result  the company usually experiences higher revenues and earnings in the third and fourth quarters of the year as compared to the first two quarters 
the company is also dependent on large construction projects which tend not to be seasonal  but can fluctuate from year to year based on general economic conditions 
because of the cyclical nature of its business  the financial results for any period may fluctuate from prior periods  and the company s financial condition and operating results may vary from quarter to quarter 
results from one quarter may not be indicative of its financial condition or operating results for any other quarter or for an entire year 
additionally  our industry can be highly cyclical 
as a result  our volume of business may be adversely affected by declines or delays in new projects in various geographic regions in the united states 
project schedules  in particular in connection with larger  longer term projects  can also create fluctuations in the services provided  which may adversely affect us in a given period 
the financial condition of our customers and their access to capital  variations in the margins of projects performed during any particular period  regional  national and global economic and market conditions  timing of acquisitions  the timing and magnitude of acquisition assimilation costs  interest rate fluctuations and other factors may also materially affect our periodic results 
accordingly  our operating results for any particular period may not be indicative of the results that can be expected for any o ther period

gross profit increased by million in compared to the increase resulted from increased gross profit contributed by jcg of million in compared to this increase was partially offset by decreases in 
table of contents gross profit of million  primarily in water and wastewater projects 
the jcg gross profit amount included intangible amortization expense of million 
east construction services segment revenues decreased by million  or for compared to as a result of decreases in our florida water and wastewater construction company 
these decreases were due primarily to the substantial completion of water and wastewater construction projects in  which were not replaced with new projects in as the general economy caused potential customers to delay construction projects through and into west construction services segment revenue and gross profit for the west construction services segment for the years ending december   and were as follows thousands of revenue thousands of revenue thousands of revenue west construction services revenue gross profit west construction services segment revenues increased by million  or for compared to as a result of revenue of million contributed by the rockford acquisition in the fourth quarter of and a revenue increase of million from california water and sewer pipeline projects  partially offset by a decline in revenues from oil and gas pipeline projects of million and parking structure projects of million 
gross profit for the west construction services decreased by million  or  for compared to rockford contributed gross profit of million 
this amount was offset by an million decrease in other construction work  including decreases of million on oil and gas pipeline projects  million in underground cable and conduit projects  million on water and sewer projects in california and million in horizontal directional drilling projects 
these reductions were as a result of the general slowdown in business primarily in california 
gross profit as a percent of revenues decreased to in compared to in primarily as a result of lower utilization of equipment and manpower  especially in the first half of west construction services segment revenues decreased by million  or for compared to as a result of decreases in our california industrial business of million 
these decreases were due primarily to the substantial completion of refinery construction projects in  which were not replaced with new projects in as the general economy caused potential customers to delay construction projects 
in addition  revenues were reduced due to the impact of the work slowdown and demobilizations of a large refinery project located in richmond  california 
the revenue reduction was partially offset by revenue increases of million in california underground projects  including pipeline and cable and conduit projects 
west construction services segment gross profit increased by million  or  for compared to the increase resulted from improved margins as a percentage of revenue of in compared to in  partially offset by reduced profits in the refining sector because of lower revenues  and lower revenues and profits obtained from third party equipment rentals

table of contents revenue for the engineering segment increased by million  or  for  compared to  due to several new projects that began in the first half of  replacing completed projects in gross profit for the engineering segment for increased to million from million for the same period in  an increase of million 
gross margin as a percent of revenues for was compared to for the same period in a significant portion of the increase was due to improvements in the final costs of several complex projects completed in compared to the estimated costs for these projects identified in the prior year 
these improvements resulted in a favorable impact to gross profit of million for excluding the impact of these projects  gross profit for was million  a net increase of million compared to the same period in the prior year  with gross profit as a percent of revenues of in compared to for engineering segment revenue decreased by million  or  for compared to the revenue decrease was primarily the result of major alliance work and a major process plant being completed in alliance projects generated million revenue in compared to million in engineering segment gross profit increased by million  or  for compared to the increase resulted from increased margin on a major project in thailand and successful completion of a major process plant  partially offset by reduced gross profit margins in alliance work 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased million  or  for compared to of the increased amount  approximately million was added by the acquisitions of jcg and rockford  including million for amortization of intangible assets 
the balance of the increase of million was due in part to several one time expenses in  including a million impairment charge for intangible assets and goodwill of a small acquisition made in  offset by a reduction in a liability relating to the termination of that investment s earnout agreement 
additional one time items include a charge of million for a reserve associated with collection of receivables and return of equipment associated with the all day electric joint venture  the impact of recognizing million less in gain on sale of equipment in compa red to  an increase of million for audit and tax fees as a result of the jcg and rockford acquisitions and a one time  non cash charge of million relating to the additional consideration to be paid to the sellers of jcg upon achievement of the earn out financial target 
sg a increased million  or  for compared to the increase was due primarily to various factors  including million for acquisition expenses related to the jcg and cravens acquisition due diligence efforts  a lower allocation of million of general and administrative expenses to costs of sales primarily in our engineering segments due to lower revenue levels in in addition  expenses increased by million reflecting additional public company expenses  including increases in directors fees  audit fees  sarbanes oxley compliance costs  consultant fees  legal fees and payroll

sg a expenses were offset by gains on the sales of equipment of million in compared with a million in sg a expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to for from for this decrease as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to the increase in revenues which allowed better absorption of the relatively fixed expenses 
merger related stock expense as part of the merger of rhapsody and former primoris in july  we issued  shares of common stock to two foreign managers 
we recognized million of non cash expenses and recorded an increase to additional paid in capital 
we also recorded an expense of million in and million in for  shares issued each year to the foreign managers in accordance with primoris attaining its financial performance targets 
other income and expense non operating income and expense items for the years ended december   and were as follows

foreign exchange gain for  and reflect currency exchange fluctuations of the united states dollar compared to the canadian dollar 
our contracts in calgary  canada are sold based on united states dollars  but a portion of the work is paid for with canadian dollars creating a currency exchange difference 
other expense of million in reflects the non cash accretion expense associated with the present value calculations of the contingent liability for the earn out agreements for jcg and rockford 
both jcg and rockford met the earn out targets 
additional expense for achieving those targets is included in sg a 
interest income decreased for and compared to as a result of declining interest rates and our decision to invest our excess cash balances primarily in treasury bills and certificate of deposits cd s purchased through the cdars certificate of deposit account registry service and in money market accounts  rather than commercial paper 
the decrease was partially offset by higher average cash balances in the and period 
interest expense increased by million for and decreased million for compared to the million increase in was due to an increase of million for interest paid on the subordinated debt from the jcg and rockford acquisitions  an increase of million as a result of increased financing of equipment that were part of the jcg and rockford acquisitions  and million in interest on federal income taxes 
the weighted average interest rate on total debt outstanding at december   and was  and  respectively 
provision for income taxes our provision for income tax increased million to million for compared to the tax rate applied for was compared to for the increase in the expected tax rate reflects our estimated full year results and assumptions of our mix of revenues and profits in the various tax jurisdictions throughout the usa and canada 
we recorded a tax charge of million in in order to adjust the prior year accrual to the actual tax returns filed and recorded a one time tax charge of million for unrecognized tax benefits 
our provision for income tax increased million for to million from as a result of the change of tax status from that of a subchapter s of the internal revenue code s corporation to that of a subchapter c of the internal revenue code c corporation as part of the merger agreement on july  thereafter  we became subject to federal and state income tax in the jurisdictions in which we do business  including california 
with the change in tax status  our effective tax rate for the year ended december  and december  was and  respectively 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  included the impact of a million tax benefit for establishing our beginning deferred tax assets

as of december   a net liability for this transaction was on the balance sheet and amounted to million 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates general the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and also affect the amounts of revenues and expenses reported for each period 
these estimates and assumptions must be made because certain information that is used in the preparation of our financial statements cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from data available  is dependent on future events  or is not capable of being readily calculated based on generally accepted methodologies 
often  these estimates are particularly difficult to determine and we must exercise significant judgment 
estimates may be used in our assessments of revenue recognition under percentage of completion accounting  the allowance for doubtful accounts  useful lives of property and equipment  fair value assumptions in analyzing goodwill and long lived asset impairments  self insured claims liabilities and deferred income taxes 
actual results could differ from those that result from using the estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
the following accounting policies are based on  among other things  judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties 
management s estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period 
fixed price contracts fixed price contracts carry certain inherent risks  including underestimation of costs  problems with new technologies and economic and other changes that may occur over the contract period 
we recognize revenues using the percentage of completion method for fixed price contracts  which may result in uneven and irregular results 
unforeseen events and circumstances can alter the estimate of the costs and potential profit associated with a particular contract 
to the extent that original cost estimates are modified  estimated costs to complete increase  delivery schedules are delayed  or progress under a contract is otherwise impeded  cash flow  revenue recognition and profitability from a particular contract may be overstated or understated 
revenue recognition we typically structure contracts as unit price  time and material  fixed price or cost plus fixed fee 
we believe that our operating results should be evaluated over a time horizon during which major contracts in progress are completed and change orders  extra work  variations in the scope of work and cost recoveries and other claims are negotiated and realized 
we recognize revenue on the percentage of completion method for all of the types of contracts described in the paragraph above 
under the percentage of completion method  estimated contract income and resulting revenue is generally accrued based on costs incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated costs 
total estimated costs  and thus contract income  are impacted by changes in productivity  scheduling  and the unit cost of labor  subcontracts  materials and equipment 
additionally  external factors such as weather  client needs  client delays in providing permits and approvals  labor availability  governmental regulation and politics may affect the progress of a project s completion and thus the timing of revenue recognition 
if a current estimate of total contract cost indicates a loss on a contract  the projected loss is recognized in full when determined 
we consider unapproved change orders to be contract variations on which we have customer approval for scope change  but not for price change associated with such scope change 
costs associated with unapproved change orders are included in the estimated cost to complete the contracts and are expensed as incurred 
we recognize revenue equal to costs incurred on unapproved change orders when realization of price approval is probable and the estimated amount is equal to or greater than costs related to the unapproved change order 
revenue recognized on unapproved change orders is included in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on the consolidated balance sheets 

table of contents unapproved change orders involve the use of estimates  and it is reasonably possible that revisions to the estimated costs and recoverable amounts may be required in future reporting periods to reflect changes in estimates or final agreements with customers 
we consider claims to be amounts we seek or will seek to collect from customers or others for customer caused changes in contract specifications or design  or other customer related causes of unanticipated additional contract costs on which there is no agreement with customers on both scope and price changes 
revenue from claims is recognized when agreement is reached with customers as to the value of the claims  which in some instances may not occur until after completion of work under the contract 
costs associated with claims are included in the estimated costs to complete the contracts and are expensed when incurred 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method as set forth in asc topic formerly referred to as sfas  accounting for income taxes  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the affect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period tha t includes the enactment date 
deferred income tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if  in the judgment of our management  it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in making such determination  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including recent financial operations  projected future taxable income  scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  tax planning strategies  and the length of tax asset carryforward periods 
the realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient future taxable earnings in certain jurisdictions 
if we subsequently determine that the carrying value of these assets  which had been written down  would be realized in the future  the value of the deferred tax assets would be increased  thereby increasing net income in the period when that determination was made 
effective january   the company also adopted accounting for uncertainty in income taxes as set forth in the accounting guidance asc topic until july   former primoris was taxed as an s corporation under subchapter s of the internal revenue code and similar codes in states in which former primoris was subject to taxation  which meant that income was taxed for federal income tax purposes to the stockholders 
after the merger  the combined entity became taxable as a c corporation  which changed the level of taxation of former primoris from that of its stockholders to that of the company 
for the twelve months ended december   we computed our provision for income taxes using a tax rate  which reflected the rate necessary to bring the year to date provision for income taxes in line with the estimated annual effective tax rate of 
our deferred income tax provision in included approximately million in net deferred tax benefits resulting from the recognition of beginning def erred tax assets  with realization primarily in goodwill goodwill is assessed for impairment annually and more frequently if triggering events occur 
in performing these assessments  management relies on various factors  including operating results  business plans  economic projections  anticipated future cash flows  comparable transactions and other market data 
there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill for impairment 
since judgment is involved in performing fair value measurements used in goodwill impairment analyses  there is risk that the carrying values of our goodwill may be overstated 
goodwill is tested on october each year 
when testing for goodwill impairment  we follow the guidance prescribed in asc topic intangibles goodwill and other formerly referred to as sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
first  we compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount 
fair value for the goodwill impairment test is determined utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis based on our budgets discounted using our weighted average cost of capital and market indicators of terminal year cash flows 
other valuation methods may be used to corroborate the discounted cash flow method 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit is in excess of its fair value  goodwill is considered potentially impaired and further tests are performed to measure the amount of impairment loss 
in the second step of the goodwill impairment test  we compare the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the carrying amount of goodwill over its implied fair value 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner that the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined 
we allocate the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit  including intangible assets  as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination 
any excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities represents the implied fair value of goodwill 

table of contents disruptions to our business  such as end market conditions  protracted economic weakness  unexpected significant declines in operating results of reporting units and the divestiture of a significant component of a reporting unit may result in our having to perform a goodwill impairment first step valuation analysis for some or all of our reporting units prior to the required annual assessment 
these types of events and the resulting analysis could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future 
as further discussed in note business combinations of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k  our goodwill balances have increased significantly since due to the acquisitions of jcg in december and rockford in november long lived assets assets held and used by the company  primarily property  plant and equipment  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable 
we perform undiscounted operation cash flow analyses to determine if impairment exists 
for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use  we group assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identified 
if an impairment is determined to exist  any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value 
the calculation of the fair value of long lived assets is based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates  re flecting varying degrees of perceived risk 
since judgment is involved in determining the fair value and useful lives of long lived assets  there is a risk that the carrying value of our long lived assets may be overstated or understated 
reserve for uninsured risks estimates are inherent in the assessment of our exposure to material uninsured risks 
significant judgments by us and reliance on third party experts are utilized in determining probable and or reasonably estimable amounts to be recorded or disclosed in the financial statements 
the results of any changes in accounting estimates are reflected in the financial statements of the period in which the changes are determined 
we self insure worker s compensation claims to a certain level 
we maintained a self insurance reserve totaling approximately million at december  and approximately million at december  claims administration expenses were charged to current operations as incurred 
our accruals are based on judgment  the probability of losses  and where applicable  the consideration of opinions of internal and or external legal counsel 
the amount is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our balance sheets

table of contents during the past three years  global market and economic conditions have been volatile and have had an adverse impact on financial markets in general 
many lenders and institutional investors have reduced and  in some cases  ceased to provide funding to borrowers resulting in severely diminished liquidity and credit availability 
the extent to which these conditions will persist is unclear 
at this time  the credit markets have not adversely affected the company s cost and availability of funding  and we do not expect it to be materially impacted in the near future 
we have experienced no loss or lack of access to our cash or cash equivalents or funds under our credit facility  however  we can provide no assurances that access to our cash  cash equivalents and funds under our credit facility will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets

table of contents backlog in the industries in which we operate  backlog can be considered an indicator of potential future performance because it represents a portion of the future revenue stream 
different companies in our industry define backlog differently 
we consider backlog as the anticipated revenue from the uncompleted portions of existing contracts 
we calculate backlog differently for different types of contracts 
for our fixed price and fixed unit price contracts  we include the full remaining portion of the contract in our calculation 
since their ultimate revenue amount is difficult to determine  we do not include time and equipment  time and materials and cost plus contracts in the calculation of backlog 
most fixed price contracts may be terminated by our customers on relatively short notice 
in the event of a project cancellation  we may be reimbursed for certain costs  but typically we have no contractual right to the total revenues reflected in backlog 
projects may remain in backlog for extended periods of time 
as of december   our total backlog was million representing an increase of million  or  from million as of december  no substantial backlog was obtained due to the rockford acquisition on november   because the current work in progress consists primarily of one major reimbursable cost plus margin pipeline project 
we expect that approximately of the total backlog at december   will be recognized as revenue during backlog by operating segment at december   and was as follows segment amount percentage amount percentage amount percentage dollars in millions east construction services west construction services engineering in july  we announced the demobilization of a large construction project at chevron corp s richmond refinery located in contra costa  california 
our work on the project was performed under a contract from praxair  inc in march  were received a notice of termination from the project from praxair 
contractually  the notice of termination converted the project from a fixed price contract to a reimbursed cost plus margin contract 
since we normally do not backlog reimbursed cost projects  we adjusted the backlog amount at december  by approximately million for the terminated project 
during  the company reached a settlement agreement with pra xair for reimbursement of costs incurred 
the significant increase in backlog in included million as a result of the december jcg acquisition 
backlog should not be considered a comprehensive indicator of future revenues  as a significant portion of our revenues are derived from projects that are not part of a backlog calculation 
during the twelve months ended december   approximately million of revenue which included million attributable to the rockford acquisition was generated by projects completed under master service agreements  reimbursed cost plus margin agreements  time and material contracts  and fixed unit price contracts 
effects of inflation and changing prices our operations are affected by increases in prices  whether caused by inflation or other economic factors 
we attempt to recover anticipated increases in the cost of labor  equipment  fuel and materials through price escalation provisions in certain major contracts or by considering the estimated effect of such increases when bidding or pricing new work or by entering into back to back contracts with suppliers and subcontractors

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to risks related to market conditions 
these risks primarily include fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices 
we may seek to manage these risks through the use of financial derivative instruments 
these instruments may include foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate swaps 
we do not execute transactions or use financial derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we enter into transactions with counter parties that are generally financial institutions in a matter to limit significant exposure with any one party 
as of december   there were no derivative financial instruments outstanding 
as of december   primoris had five derivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging future currency exchange in canadian dollars 
the contracts enabled primoris to purchase canadian dollars before certain dates in at certain exchange rates 
these contracts expired during the months of january through june the related gain or loss on thee contracts was not significant 
we intend to continue to hedge foreign currency risks in those situations where we believe such transactions are prudent 
at december   our long term debt portfolio consisted of fixed rate instruments 
the carrying amounts for cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  short term investments  notes payable and accounts payable and accrued liabilities shown in the consolidated balance sheets approximate fair value at december   due to the generally short maturities of these items 
at december   we invested primarily in short term dollar denominated bank deposits  money market accounts and other four to six month certificates of deposits cds through the cdars certificate of deposit account registry service process to provide fdic backing of the cds 
we expect to hold our investments to maturity
