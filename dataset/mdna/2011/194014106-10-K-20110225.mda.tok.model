item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
for a discussion of risks related to our non us operations and foreign currency exchange  please refer to item a 
risk factors 
raw materials and backlog we obtain raw materials  component parts and supplies from a variety of sources  generally each from more than one supplier 
our principal raw materials are metals  castings  motors  seals and bearings 
our suppliers and sources of raw materials are based in the united states and other countries 
we believe that our sources of raw materials are adequate for our needs for the foreseeable future and the loss of any one supplier would not have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 
manufacturing turnaround time is generally sufficiently short to allow us to manufacture to order for most of our products  which helps to limit inventory levels 
backlog generally is a function of requested customer delivery dates and may range from days to several years 
backlog of orders as of december  was million  compared with million as of december  we expect to ship approximately of our december  backlog during  however  orders are subject to postponement or cancellation 
seasonality our fluid handling business is seasonal 
as our customers seek to fully utilize capital spending budgets before the end of the year  historically our shipments have peaked during the fourth quarter 
also  our european operations typically experience a slowdown during the july and august holiday season 
working capital we maintain an adequate level of working capital to support our business needs 
there are no unusual industry practices or requirements related to working capital items 
associates the following table presents our worldwide associate base as of the periods indicated year ended december  north america europe asia and middle east total there are associates in the united states covered by a collective bargaining agreement with the international union of electronic  electrical  salaried  machine and furniture workers communications workers of america iue cwa 
the contract with the union expires december  and provides for wage increases ranging from to a maximum of per year 
in addition  approximately of our associates are represented by foreign trade unions  by law  in germany  sweden and the netherlands  which subjects us to arrangements very similar to collective bargaining agreements 
we have not experienced any work stoppages or strikes that have had a material adverse impact on operations 
we consider our relations with our associates to be good 
government contracts sales to us government defense agencies and government contractors constituted approximately of our revenue in we are subject to business and cost accounting regulations associated with our us government defense contracts 
violations can result in civil  criminal or administrative proceedings involving fines  compensatory and treble damages  restitution  forfeitures  and suspension or debarment from us government defense contracts

item a 
risk factors an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below  together with the information included elsewhere in this annual report on form k and other documents we file with the sec 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or operating results could suffer 
as a result  the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in our common stock 
the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material  but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us and we caution that this list of risk factors may not be exhaustive 
our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies  such as overall us and us economic and industry conditions  a global economic slowdown  geopolitical events  changes in laws or accounting rules  fluctuations in interest rates  terrorism  international conflicts  natural disasters or other disruptions of expected economic or business conditions 
we operate in a continually changing business environment  and new risk factors emerge from time to time which we cannot predict 
additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business  including our results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
risks related to our business changes in the general economy and the cyclical nature of our markets could harm our operations and financial performance 
our financial performance depends  in large part  on conditions in the markets we serve and on the general condition of the global economy 
any sustained weakness in demand  downturn or uncertainty in the global economy could reduce our sales and profitability  and result in restructuring efforts 
restructuring efforts are inherently risky and we may not be able to predict the cost and timing of such actions accurately or properly estimate the impact on demand  if any 
we also may not be able to realize the anticipated savings we expected from restructuring activities 
in addition  our products are sold in many industries  some of which are cyclical and may experience periodic downturns 
cyclical weakness in the industries we serve could lead to reduced demand for our products and affect our profitability and financial performance 
in the effects of the global economic slowdown started to recede in some markets but we still see sluggish demand and less than robust growth in certain areas 
we believe that many of our customers and suppliers are reliant on liquidity from global credit markets and in some cases  require external financing to purchase products or finance operations 
lack of liquidity or inability to access the credit markets by our customers could impact our ability to collect amounts owed to us 
further  lack of liquidity by financial institutions could impact our ability to fully access our existing credit facility 
the majority of our sales are derived from international operations 
we are subject to specific risks associated with international operations 
in the year ended december   we derived approximately of our sales from operations outside of the us and have manufacturing facilities in eight countries 
sales from international operations  export sales and the use of manufacturing facilities outside of the us are subject to risks inherent in doing business outside the us these risks include economic instability  partial or total expropriation of our international assets  trade protection measures  including tariffs or import export restrictions  currency exchange rate fluctuations and restrictions on currency repatriation  significant adverse changes in taxation policies or other laws or regulations  and the disruption of operations from political disturbances  terrorist activities  insurrection or war 
significant movements in foreign currency exchange rates may harm our financial results 
we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
in the year ended december   approximately of our sales were derived from operations outside the us a significant portion of our revenues and income are denominated in euros  swedish kronor and norwegian kroner 
consequently  depreciation of the euro  krona or krone against the us dollar has a negative impact on the income from operations of our european operations 
large fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the euro  the krona  the krone and the us dollar could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  we do not engage to a material extent in hedging activities intended to offset the risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
any significant change in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we do business against the us dollar could affect our ability to sell products competitively and control our cost structure  which  in turn  could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we are dependent on the availability of raw materials  as well as parts and components used in our products 
while we manufacture many of the parts and components used in our products  we require substantial amounts of raw materials and purchase parts and components from suppliers 
the availability and prices for raw materials  parts and components may be subject to curtailment or change due to  among other things  suppliers allocations to other purchasers  interruptions in production by suppliers  changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels 
any significant change in the supply of  or price for  these raw materials or parts and components could materially affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
in addition  delays in delivery of components or raw materials by our suppliers could cause delays in our delivery of products to our customers 
the markets we serve are highly competitive and some of our competitors may have resources superior to ours 
responding to this competition could reduce our sales and operating margins 
we sell most of our products in highly fragmented and competitive markets 
we believe that the principal elements of competition in our markets are the ability to meet customer specifications  application expertise and design and engineering capabilities  product quality and brand name  timeliness of delivery  price  and quality of aftermarket sales and support 
in order to maintain and enhance our competitive position  we intend to continue our investment in manufacturing quality  marketing  customer service and support  and distribution networks 
we may not have sufficient resources to continue to make these investments and we may not be able to maintain our competitive position 
our competitors may develop products that are superior to our products  develop methods of more efficiently and effectively providing products and services  or adapt more quickly than we do to new technologies or evolving customer requirements 
some of our competitors may have greater financial  marketing and research and development resources than we have 
as a result  those competitors may be better able to withstand the effects of periodic economic downturns 
in addition  pricing pressures could cause us to lower the prices of some of our products to stay competitive 
we may not be able to compete successfully with our existing competitors or with new competitors 
if we fail to compete successfully  the failure may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
acquisitions have formed a significant part of our growth strategy in the past and are expected to continue to do so 
if we are unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates or successfully integrate the businesses we acquire or realize the intended benefits  our growth strategy may not succeed 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including risks related to integration and undisclosed or underestimated liabilities 
historically  our business strategy has relied on acquisitions 
we expect to derive a significant portion of our growth by acquiring businesses and integrating those businesses into our existing operations 
we intend to seek acquisition opportunities both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in our existing markets 
however  our ability to do so will depend on a number of steps  including our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates  negotiate appropriate acquisition terms  obtain debt or equity financing that we may need to complete proposed acquisitions  complete the proposed acquisitions  and integrate the acquired business into our existing operations 
if we fail to achieve any of these steps  our growth strategy may not be successful 
in addition  acquisitions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations  technologies  services and products of the acquired company  the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company and the diversion of our management s attention from other business concerns 
this is the case particularly in the fiscal quarters immediately following the completion of an acquisition because the operations of the acquired business are integrated into the acquiring businesses operations during this period 
we cannot be sure that we will accurately anticipate all of the changing demands that any future acquisition may impose on our management  our operational and management information systems and our financial systems 
we may underestimate or fail to discover liabilities relating to a future acquisition during the due diligence investigation and we  as the successor owner  might be responsible for those liabilities 
for example  two of our acquired subsidiaries are each one of many defendants in a large number of lawsuits that claim personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos from products manufactured with components that are alleged to have contained asbestos 
although our due diligence investigations in connection with these acquisitions uncovered the existence of potential asbestos related liabilities  the scope of such liabilities were greater than we had originally estimated 
although we seek to minimize the impact of underestimated or potential undiscovered liabilities by structuring acquisitions to minimize liabilities and obtaining indemnities and warranties from the selling party  these methods may not fully protect us from the impact of undiscovered liabilities 
indemnities or warranties are often limited in scope  amount or duration  and may not fully cover the liabilities for which they were intended 
the liabilities that are not covered by the limited indemnities or warranties could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
we may require additional capital to finance our operating needs and to finance our growth 
if the terms on which the additional capital is available are unsatisfactory  if the additional capital is not available at all or we are not able to fully access our existing credit facility  we may not be able to pursue our growth strategy 
our growth strategy will require additional capital investment to complete acquisitions  integrate the completed acquisitions into our existing operations  and to expand into new markets 
we intend to pay for future acquisitions using cash  capital stock  notes  assumption of indebtedness or any combination of the foregoing 
to the extent that we do not generate sufficient cash internally to provide the capital we require to fund our growth strategy and future operations  we will require additional debt or equity financing 
we cannot be sure that this additional financing will be available or  if available  will be on terms acceptable to us 
further  high volatility in the equity markets and in our stock price may make it difficult for us to access the equity markets for additional capital at attractive prices  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient additional capital in the future  it may limit our ability to implement fully our business strategy 
even if future debt financing is available  it may result in increased interest expense  increased term loan payments  increased leverage  and decreased income available to fund further acquisitions and expansion 
it may also limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and make us more vulnerable to economic downturns 
if future equity financing is available  issuances of our equity securities may dilute our existing stockholders 
in addition  our credit facility agreement includes restrictive covenants which could limit our financial flexibility 
if we do not maintain compliance with these covenants  our creditors could declare a default 
our ability to comply with the provisions of our indebtedness may be affected by changes in economic or business conditions beyond our control 
a material disruption at any of our manufacturing facilities could adversely affect our ability to generate sales and meet customer demand 
if operations at our manufacturing facilities were to be disrupted as a result of significant equipment failures  natural disasters  power outages  fires  explosions  terrorism  adverse weather conditions  labor disputes or other reasons  our financial performance could be adversely affected as a result of our inability to meet customer demand for our products 
interruptions in production could increase our costs and reduce our sales 
any interruption in production capability could require us to make substantial capital expenditures to remedy the situation  which could negatively affect our profitability and financial condition 
we maintain property damage insurance which we believe to be adequate to provide for reconstruction of facilities and equipment  as well as business interruption insurance to mitigate losses resulting from any production interruption or shutdown caused by an insured loss 
however  any recovery under our insurance policies may not offset the lost sales or increased costs that may be experienced during the disruption of operations  which could adversely affect our financial performance 
efforts to realign our operating platform could disrupt our business and affect our results of operations 
in recognition of our evolving global business  we are moving from a business unit structure to a global functional operating structure 
we believe this strategic realignment will better allow us to deliver customer centric fluid handling solutions 
inherent in any realignment of operations are risks related to our ability to structure our business in a way that accomplishes our goals and best responds to customer needs without causing disruption to our ongoing business 
available insurance coverage  the number of future asbestos related claims and the average settlement value of current and future asbestos related claims of two of our subsidiaries could be different than we have estimated  which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
two of our subsidiaries are each one of many defendants in a large number of lawsuits that claim personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos from products manufactured with components that are alleged to have contained asbestos 
such components were acquired from third party suppliers and were not manufactured by any of our subsidiaries nor were the subsidiaries producers or direct suppliers of asbestos 
for purposes of our financial statements  we have estimated the future claims exposure and the amount of insurance available based upon certain assumptions with respect to future claims and liability costs 
we estimate the liability costs to be incurred in resolving pending and forecasted claims for the next year period 
our decision to use a year period is based on our belief that this is the extent of our ability to forecast liability costs 
we also estimate the amount of insurance proceeds available for such claims based on the current financial strength of the various insurers  our estimate of the likelihood of payment and applicable current law 
we reevaluate these estimates regularly 
although we believe our current estimates are reasonable  a change in the time period used for forecasting our liability costs  the actual number of future claims brought against us  the cost of resolving these claims  the likelihood of payment by  and the solvency of  insurers and the amount of remaining insurance available could be substantially different than our estimates  and future revaluation of our liabilities and insurance recoverables could result in material adjustments to these estimates  any of which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
in addition  the company incurs defense costs related to those claims  a portion of which has historically been reimbursed by our insurers 
we also incur litigation costs in connection with actions against certain of the subsidiaries insurers relating to insurance coverage 
while these costs may be significant  we may not be able to predict the amount or duration of such costs 
additionally  we may experience delays in receiving reimbursement from insurers  during which time we may be required to pay cash for settlement or legal defense costs 
any increase in the actual number of future claims brought against us  the defense costs of resolving these claims  the cost of pursuing claims against our insurers  the likelihood and timing of payment by  and the solvency of  insurers and the amount of remaining insurance available  could materially and adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
our international operations are subject to the laws and regulations of the united states and many foreign countries 
failure to comply with these laws may affect our ability to conduct business in certain countries and may affect our financial performance 
we are subject to a variety of laws regarding our international operations  including the foreign corrupt practices act and regulations issued by us customs and border protection  the bureau of industry and security  and the regulations of various foreign governmental agencies 
we cannot predict the nature  scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international sales and manufacturing operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted 
future regulations could limit the countries in which some of our products may be manufactured or sold  or could restrict our access to  and increase the cost of obtaining  products from foreign sources 
in addition  actual or alleged violations of these laws could result in enforcement actions and financial penalties that could result in substantial costs 
our foreign subsidiaries have done and may continue to do business in countries subject to us sanctions and embargoes  including iran and syria  and we have limited managerial oversight over those activities 
failure to comply with these sanctions and embargoes may result in enforcement or other regulatory actions 
from time to time  certain of our foreign subsidiaries sell products to companies and entities located in  or controlled by the governments of  certain countries that are or have previously been subject to sanctions and embargoes imposed by the us government and or the united nations  such as iran and syria 
with the exception of the us sanctions against cuba  the applicable sanctions and embargoes generally do not prohibit our foreign subsidiaries from selling non us origin products and services in those countries 
however  colfax corporation  its us personnel and its domestic subsidiaries  as well as employees of our foreign subsidiaries who are us citizens  are prohibited from participating in  approving or otherwise facilitating any aspect of the business activities in those countries 
these constraints may negatively affect the financial or operating performance of such business activities 
we cannot be certain that our attempts to comply with us sanction laws and embargoes will be effective  and as a consequence we may face enforcement or other actions if our compliance efforts are not effective 
actual or alleged violations of these laws could result in substantial fines or other sanctions which could result in substantial costs 
in addition  iran and syria currently are identified by the state department as state sponsors of terrorism  and may be subject to increasingly restrictive sanctions 
because certain of our foreign subsidiaries have contact with and transact business in such countries  including sales to enterprises controlled by agencies of the governments of such countries  our reputation may suffer due to our association with these countries  which may have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock 
further  certain us states and municipalities have recently enacted legislation regarding investments by pension funds and other retirement systems in companies that have business activities or contacts with countries that have been identified as state sponsors of terrorism and similar legislation may be pending in other states 
as a result  pension funds and other retirement systems may be subject to reporting requirements with respect to investments in companies such as ours or may be subject to limits or prohibitions with respect to those investments that may have a material adverse effect on the price of our shares 
in addition  one of our foreign subsidiaries made a small number of sales from through totaling approximately  in the aggregate to two customers in cuba which may have been made in violation of regulations of the us treasury department s office of foreign assets control  or ofac 
cuba is also identified by the us state department as a state sponsor of terrorism 
we have submitted a disclosure report to ofac regarding these transactions 
on december   the company executed a tolling agreement with the ofac extending the statute of limitations for the investigation until may  as a result of these sales  we may be subject to fines or other sanctions 
if we fail to comply with export control regulations  we could be subject to substantial fines or other sanctions 
some of our products manufactured or assembled in the united states are subject to the us export administration regulations  administered by the us department of commerce  bureau of industry and security  which require that we obtain an export license before we can export such products to specified countries 
additionally  some of our products are subject to the international traffic in arms regulations  which restrict the export of certain military or intelligence related items  technologies and services to non us persons 
failure to comply with these laws could harm our business by subjecting us to sanctions by the us government  including substantial monetary penalties  denial of export privileges and debarment from us government contracts 
approximately of our employees are represented by foreign trade unions 
if the representation committees responsible for negotiating with these unions on our behalf are unsuccessful in negotiating new and acceptable agreements when the existing agreements with our employees covered by the unions expire or if the foreign trade unions chose not to support our restructuring programs  we could experience business disruptions or increased costs 
as of december   we had  employees in foreign locations 
in certain countries  labor and employment laws are more restrictive than in the us and  in many cases  grant significant job protection to employees  including rights on termination of employment 
in germany  sweden and the netherlands  by law  some of our employees are represented by trade unions in these jurisdictions  which subjects us to employment arrangements very similar to collective bargaining agreements 
if our employees represented by foreign trade unions were to engage in a strike  work stoppage or other slowdown in the future  we could experience a significant disruption of our operations 
such disruption could interfere with our business operations and could lead to decreased productivity  increased labor costs and lost revenue 
although we have not experienced any material recent strikes or work stoppages  we cannot offer any assurance that the representation committees that negotiate with the foreign trade unions on our behalf will be successful in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements or other employment arrangements when the current ones expire 
furthermore  future labor negotiations could result in significant increases in our labor costs 
our manufacturing business is subject to the possibility of product liability lawsuits  which could harm our business 
in addition to the asbestos related liability claims described above  as the manufacturer of equipment for use in industrial markets  we face an inherent risk of exposure to other product liability claims 
although we maintain quality controls and procedures  we cannot be sure that our products will be free from defects 
in addition  some of our products contain components manufactured by third parties  which may also have defects 
we maintain insurance coverage for product liability claims 
our insurance policies have limits  however  that may not be sufficient to cover claims made against us 
in addition  this insurance may not continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost 
with respect to components manufactured by third party suppliers  the contractual indemnification that we seek from our third party suppliers may be limited and thus insufficient to cover claims made against us 
if our insurance coverage or contractual indemnification is insufficient to satisfy product liability claims made against us  the claims could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
even claims without merit could harm our reputation  reduce demand for our products  cause us to incur substantial legal costs and distract the attention of our management 
as a manufacturer  we are subject to a variety of environmental and health and safety laws for which compliance could be costly 
in addition  if we fail to comply with such laws  we could incur liability that could result in penalties and costs to correct any non compliance 
our business is subject to international  federal  state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations  including laws and regulations governing emissions of regulated air pollutants  discharges of wastewater and storm water  storage and handling of raw materials  generation  storage  transportation and disposal of regulated wastes  and worker safety 
these requirements impose on our business certain responsibilities  including the obligation to obtain and maintain various environmental permits 
if we were to fail to comply with these requirements or fail to obtain or maintain a required permit  we could be subject to penalties and be required to undertake corrective action measures to achieve compliance 
in addition  if our noncompliance with such regulations were to result in a release of hazardous materials to the environment  such as soil or groundwater  we could be required to remediate such contamination  which could be costly 
moreover  noncompliance could subject us to private claims for property damage or personal injury based on exposure to hazardous materials or unsafe working conditions 
changes in applicable requirements or stricter interpretation of existing requirements may result in costly compliance requirements or otherwise subject us to future liabilities 
as the present or former owner or operator of real property  or generator of waste  we could become subject to liability for environmental contamination  regardless of whether we caused such contamination 
under various federal  state and local laws  regulations and ordinances  and  in some instances  international laws  relating to the protection of the environment  a current or former owner or operator of real property may be liable for the cost to remove or remediate contamination on  under  or released from such property and for any damage to natural resources resulting from such contamination 
similarly  a generator of waste can be held responsible for contamination resulting from the treatment or disposal of such waste at any off site location such as a landfill  regardless of whether the generator arranged for the treatment or disposal of the waste in compliance with applicable laws 
costs associated with liability for removal or remediation of contamination or damage to natural resources could be substantial and liability under these laws may attach without regard to whether the responsible party knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of the contaminants 
in addition  the liability may be joint and several 
moreover  the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination at our properties  or properties for which we are deemed responsible  may expose us to liability for property damage or personal injury  or materially adversely affect our ability to sell our real property interests or to borrow using the real property as collateral 
we cannot be sure that we will not be subject to environmental liabilities in the future as a result of historic or current operations that have resulted or will result in contamination 
failure to maintain and protect our trademarks  trade names and technology may affect our operations and financial performance 
the market for many of our products is  in part  dependent upon the goodwill engendered by our trademarks and trade names 
trademark protection is therefore material to a portion of our business 
the failure to protect our trademarks and trade names may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
litigation may be required to enforce our intellectual property rights  protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others 
any action we take to protect our intellectual property rights could be costly and could absorb significant management time and attention 
as a result of any such litigation  we could lose any proprietary rights we have 
in addition  it is possible that others will independently develop technology that will compete with our patented or unpatented technology 
the development of new technologies by competitors that may compete with our technologies could reduce demand for our products and affect our financial performance 
the loss of key leadership could have a material adverse effect on our ability to run our business 
we may be adversely affected if we lose members of our senior leadership 
we are highly dependent on our senior leadership team as a result of their expertise 
during we added several new members to our senior leadership team  including clay h 
kiefaber  our president and chief executive officer  and c 
scott brannan  our senior vice president  finance and chief financial officer 
the loss of key leadership or the inability to attract  retain and motivate sufficient numbers of qualified management personnel could have a material adverse effect on us and our business 
some of our stockholders may exert significant influence over us 
currently  two of our stockholders  mitchell p 
rales and steven m 
rales  together  and through an entity wholly owned by them  hold approximately of our outstanding common stock 
the level of ownership of these stockholders  and the service of mitchell rales as chairman of our board of directors  enables them to exert significant influence over all matters involving us  including matters presented to our stockholders for approval  such as election and removal of our directors and change of control transactions 
this concentration of ownership and voting power may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company and could prevent stockholders from receiving a premium over the market price if a change in control is proposed 
the interests of these persons may not coincide with the interests of the other holders of our common stock with respect to our operations or strategy 
the market price of our common stock may experience a high level of volatility 
the market price for our common stock has experienced a high level of volatility and may continue to do so in the future 
during the period from our initial public offering ipo to december   our common stock traded between and per share 
at any given time  you may not be able to sell your shares at a price that you think is acceptable 
the market liquidity for our stock is relatively low 
as of december   we had  shares of common stock outstanding 
the average daily trading volume in our common stock during the period from january  to december  was approximately  shares 
although a more active trading market may develop in the future  the limited market liquidity for our stock may affect your ability to sell at a price that is satisfactory to you 
stock markets in general have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company 
these broad fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
provisions in our charter documents and delaware law may delay or prevent an acquisition of our company  which could decrease the value of your shares 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation  amended and restated bylaws  and delaware law contain provisions that may make it difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors 
these provisions include prohibiting stockholders from taking action by written consent  prohibiting special meetings of stockholders called by stockholders and prohibiting stockholder nominations and approvals without complying with specific advance notice requirements 
in addition  our board of directors has the right to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval  which our board of directors could use to effect a rights plan or poison pill that could dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer and may have the effect of delaying  discouraging or preventing an acquisition of our company 
delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of or more of our outstanding voting stock 
although mitchell rales and steven rales  both individually and in the aggregate  hold more than of our outstanding voting stock  this provision of delaware law does not apply to them 
there may be limitations on our ability to fully utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and other us deferred tax assets in future periods 
we may not be able to generate sufficient future us taxable income to utilize our us net operating loss carryforwards nols and or other net us deferred tax assets 
our net us deferred tax assets  including us nols and net of valuation allowances  are million as of december  if sufficient future taxable income and or available tax planning strategies are not available to utilize some or all of these deferred tax assets  additional valuation allowances may be recorded which would negatively affect our results of operations 
our results of operations could vary as a result of the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies 
the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations see critical accounting policies and estimates in part ii  item of this form k 
such methods  estimates and judgments are  by their nature  subject to substantial risks  uncertainties and assumptions  and factors may arise over time that lead us to change our methods  estimates and judgments 
changes in those methods  estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations 
any impairment in the value of our intangible assets  including goodwill  would negatively affect our operating results and total capitalization 
our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets  primarily goodwill 
the goodwill results from our acquisitions  representing the excess of cost over the fair value of the net assets we have acquired 
we assess at least annually whether there has been impairment in the value of our intangible assets 
if future operating performance at one or more of our business units were to fall significantly below current levels  if competing or alternative technologies emerge  or if market conditions for businesses acquired declines  we could incur  under current applicable accounting rules  a non cash charge to operating earnings for goodwill impairment 
any determination requiring the write off of a significant portion of unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization  the effect of which could be material 
our defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and cash flow 
our defined benefit pension plan obligations are affected by changes in market interest rates and the majority of plan assets are invested in publicly traded debt and equity securities  which are affected by market risks 
significant changes in market interest rates  decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses or lack of expected investment gains on plan assets may adversely impact our future operating results  financial condition and cash flow

overview colfax corporation is a global supplier of a broad range of fluid handling products  including pumps  fluid handling systems and controls  and specialty valves 
we believe that we are a leading manufacturer of rotary positive displacement pumps  which include screw pumps  gear pumps and progressive cavity pumps 
we design and engineer our products to high quality and reliability standards for use in critical fluid handling applications where performance is paramount 
we also offer customized fluid handling solutions to meet individual customer needs based on our in depth technical knowledge of the applications in which our products are used 
our products are marketed principally under the allweiler  baric  fairmount  houttuin  imo  lsc  portland valve  tushaco  warren and zenith brand names 
we believe that our brands are widely known and have a premium position in our industry 
allweiler  houttuin  imo and warren are among the oldest and most recognized brands in the markets in which we participate  with allweiler dating back to we have a global manufacturing footprint  with production facilities in europe  north america and asia  as well as worldwide sales and distribution channels 
we employ a comprehensive set of tools that we refer to as the colfax business system  or cbs 
cbs is a disciplined strategic planning and execution methodology designed to achieve excellence and world class financial performance in all aspects of our business by focusing on the voice of the customer and continuously improving quality  delivery and cost 
modeled on the danaher business system  cbs focuses on conducting root cause analysis  developing process improvements and implementing sustainable systems 
our approach addresses the entire business  not just manufacturing operations 
we currently serve markets that have a need for highly engineered  critical fluid handling solutions and are global in scope 
our strategic markets include strategic markets applications commercial marine fuel oil transfer  lubrication  water and wastewater handling  cargo handling oil and gas crude oil gathering  pipeline services  unloading and loading  rotating equipment lubrication  lube oil purification power generation fuel unloading  transfer  burner and injection  rotating equipment lubrication global defense fuel oil transfer  oil transport  water and wastewater handling  firefighting  fluid control general industrial machinery lubrication  hydraulic elevators  chemical processing  pulp and paper processing  food and beverage processing we serve a global customer base across multiple markets through a combination of direct sales and marketing associates and third party distribution channels 
our customer base is highly diversified and includes commercial  industrial and government customers 
our business began in with the intention to acquire  manage and create a world class industrial manufacturing company 
we seek to acquire businesses with leading market positions and brands that exhibit strong cash flow generation potential 
with our management expertise and the introduction of cbs into our acquired businesses  we pursue growth in revenues  improvements in operating margins and increasing cash flow 
outlook we believe that we are well positioned to grow our business organically over the long term by enhancing our product offerings and expanding our customer base in our strategic markets 
as a late cycle business  we began to recover from the global economic downturn midway through this recovery was evidenced by increases in both sales and orders in the third and fourth quarters of over the comparable quarters 
nonetheless  project delivery push outs as well as order cancellations may continue in we will continue to monitor general global economic conditions and expect the following market conditions in the commercial marine industry  we expect international trade and demand for crude oil and other commodities as well as the age of the global merchant fleet to continue to create demand for new ship construction over the long term 
we also believe the increase in the size of the global fleet will create an opportunity to supply aftermarket parts and service 
in addition  we believe pending and future environmental regulations will enhance the demand for our products 
based on the modest increase in orders in and our current backlog  we expect sales in to be similar to levels 
we are also likely to have additional order cancellations as well as delivery date extensions in the near term 
in the crude oil industry  we expect long term activity to remain favorable as capacity constraints and global demand drive further development of heavy oil fields 
in pipeline applications  we expect demand for our highly efficient products to remain strong as our customers continue to focus on total cost of ownership 
in refinery applications  projects that were deferred due to weak economic conditions have been released for quoting 
we expect sales and orders to be at significantly higher levels in than in in the power generation industry  we expect activity in asia and the middle east to remain solid as economic growth and fundamental undersupply of power generation capacity continue to drive investment in energy infrastructure projects 
in the world s developed economies  we expect efficiency improvements will continue to drive demand 
nevertheless  in  we expect both sales and orders to be at significantly lower levels than  due to the conclusion of contractual obligations of our foreign subsidiaries to provide products to certain customers in the middle east 
in the us  we expect congress to continue to appropriate funds for new ship construction as older naval vessels are decommissioned 
we also expect increased demand for integrated fluid handling systems for both new ship platforms and existing ship classes that reduce operating costs and improve efficiency as the us navy seeks to man vessels with fewer personnel 
outside of the us  we expect other sovereign nations will continue to expand their fleets as they address national security concerns 
we expect modest growth in sales during and expect orders to decline as a result of significant growth in orders in and the timing of projects 
in the general industrial market  we expect long term demand to be driven by capital investment 
while this market is very diverse  orders in increased significantly compared to in both europe and north america 
we expect growth in both orders and sales in our global manufacturing sales and distribution network allows us to target fast growing regions throughout the world 
we have production and distribution facilities in india and china and opened a middle east sales and engineering office in bahrain in we intend to leverage these investments to grow our market share in these emerging markets and plan to continue to invest in sales and marketing resources to increase our overall coverage 
we will also continue to target aftermarket opportunities in our strategic markets as we generally are able to generate higher margins on aftermarket parts and service than on foremarket opportunities 
for the year ended december   aftermarket sales and services represented approximately of our revenues 
we also expect to continue to grow as a result of strategic acquisitions 
we believe that the extensive experience of our leadership team in acquiring and effectively integrating acquisition targets should enable us to capitalize on opportunities in the future 
results of operations key performance measures the discussion of our results of operations that follows focuses on some of the key financial measures that we use to evaluate our business 
we evaluate our business using several measures  including net sales  orders and order backlog 
our sales  orders and backlog are affected by many factors  particularly the impact of acquisitions  the impact of fluctuating foreign exchange rates and change from our existing businesses which may be driven by market conditions and other factors 
to facilitate the comparison between reporting periods  we describe the impact of each of these three factors  to the extent they impact the periods presented  on our sales  orders and backlog in tabular format under the heading sales and orders 
orders and order backlog are highly indicative of our future revenue and thus are key measures of anticipated performance 
orders consist of contracts for products or services from our customers  net of cancellations 
order backlog consists of unfilled orders 
items affecting the comparability of our reported results our financial performance and growth are driven by many factors  principally our ability to serve increasingly global markets  fluctuations in the relationship of foreign currencies to the us dollar  the general economic conditions within our five strategic markets  the global economy and capital spending levels  the availability of capital  our estimates concerning the availability of insurance proceeds to cover asbestos litigation expenses and liabilities  the amounts of asbestos liabilities and litigation expenses  the impact of restructuring initiatives  our ability to pass through cost increases through pricing  the impact of sales mix  and our ability to continue to grow through acquisitions 
these key factors have impacted our results of operations in the past and are likely to affect them in the future 
global operations our products and services are available worldwide 
the manner in which our products and services are sold differs by region 
most of our sales in non us markets are made by subsidiaries located outside the united states  though we also sell into non us markets through various representatives and distributors and directly from the us in countries with low sales volumes  we generally sell through representatives and distributors 
for the year ended december   approximately of our sales were shipped to locations outside of the us accordingly  we are affected by levels of industrial activity and economic and political factors in countries throughout the world 
our ability to grow and our financial performance will be affected by our ability to address a variety of challenges and opportunities that are a consequence of our global operations  including efficiently utilizing our global sales  manufacturing and distribution capabilities  the expansion of market opportunities in asia  successfully completing global strategic acquisitions  and engineering innovative new product applications for end users in a variety of geographic markets 
however  we believe that our geographic  end market and product diversification may limit the impact that any one country or economy could have on our consolidated results 
foreign currency fluctuations a significant portion of our sales  approximately for the year ended december   are derived from operations outside the us  with the majority of those sales denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  especially the euro 
because much of our manufacturing and employee costs are outside the us  a significant portion of our costs are also denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
changes in foreign exchange rates can impact our results and are quantified when significant in our discussion of our operations 
economic conditions in strategic markets our organic growth and profitability strategy focuses on five strategic markets commercial marine  oil and gas  power generation  global defense and general industrial 
demand for our products depends on the level of new capital investment and planned maintenance by our customers 
the level of capital expenditures depends  in turn  on the general economic conditions within that market as well as access to capital at reasonable cost 
while demand within each of these strategic markets can be cyclical  the diversity of these markets may limit the impact of a downturn in any one of these markets on our consolidated results 
pricing we believe our customers place a premium on quality  reliability  availability  design and application engineering support 
our highly engineered fluid handling products typically have higher margins than products with commodity like qualities 
however  we are sensitive to price movements in our raw materials supply base 
our largest material purchases are for components and raw materials consisting of steel  iron  copper and aluminum 
historically  we have been generally successful in passing raw material price increases on to our customers 
while we seek to take actions to manage this risk  including commodity hedging where appropriate  such increased costs may adversely impact earnings 
sales and cost mix our profit margins vary in relation to the relative mix of many factors  including the type of product  the geographic location in which the product is manufactured  the end market for which the product is designed  and the percentage of total revenue represented by aftermarket sales and services 
aftermarket business  including spare parts and other value added services  is generally a higher margin business and is a significant component of our profitability 
strategic acquisitions we complement our organic growth with strategic acquisitions 
acquisitions can significantly affect our reported results and can complicate period to period comparisons of results 
as a consequence  we report the change in our sales between periods both from existing and acquired businesses 
we intend to continue to pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses that will broaden our product portfolio  expand our geographic footprint or enhance our position within our strategic markets 
on august   we completed the acquisition of baric group baric  a supplier of highly engineered fluid handling systems primarily for lubrication applications  with its primary operations based in blyth  united kingdom 
on august   we completed the acquisition of pd technik ingenieurb ro gmbh pd technik  a provider of marine aftermarket related products and services located in hamburg  germany 
the acquisition of pd technik supports our marine aftermarket growth initiatives  broadening our served market as well as service capabilities 
restructuring and other related charges the company initiated a series of restructuring actions beginning in in response to then current and expected future economic conditions 
as a result  for the years ended december  and  the company recorded pre tax restructuring and other related costs of million and million  respectively 
the costs incurred in the year ended december  include million of termination benefits  including million of non cash stock based compensation expense  related to the departure of the company s former president and chief executive officer in january of additionally  the costs incurred in the year ended december  include million of termination benefits related to the october departures of the company s former chief financial officer and general counsel 
the costs incurred in the year ended december  include a million non cash asset impairment charge related to closure of a repair facility 
as of december   excluding additions from businesses acquired in and  we have reduced our company wide workforce by associates from december  additionally  through the second quarter of  we participated in a german government sponsored furlough program in which the government paid the wage related costs for participating associates 
we realized savings of approximately million in from the restructuring initiatives implemented in and  primarily reflecting lower employee costs 
the company has relocated its richmond  virginia corporate headquarters to the columbia  maryland area  in order to provide improved access to international travel and to its key advisors 
in connection with the move  the company has incurred million of employee termination benefit costs  reflected in restructuring and other related charges  and million of other relocation related costs in  which are reflected in selling  general and administrative expenses 
we expect to incur an additional million of employee termination benefit costs  operating lease exit costs and other relocation expenses related to the headquarters relocation in the first six months of ipo related costs results for the year ended december  include million of nonrecurring costs associated with our ipo during the second quarter 
this amount includes million of share based compensation and million of special cash bonuses paid under previously adopted executive compensation plans as well as million of employer payroll taxes and other related costs 
it also includes million to reimburse the selling stockholders for the underwriting discount on the shares sold by them as well as the write off of million of deferred loan costs associated with the early termination of a credit facility 
legacy legal adjustment selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  include a million increase to legal reserves related to a non asbestos legal matter that arose from the sale and subsequent repair of a product by a division of a subsidiary that was divested prior to our acquisition of the subsidiary 
this legacy legal case was settled during the third quarter of asbestos liability and defense costs income our financial results have been  and will likely in the future be  affected by our asbestos liabilities and the availability of insurance to cover these liabilities and defense costs related to asbestos personal injury litigation against two of our subsidiaries  as well as costs arising from our legal action against our insurers 
assessing asbestos liabilities and insurance assets requires judgments concerning matters such as the uncertainty of litigation  anticipated outcome of settlements  the number and cost of pending and future claims  the outcome of legal action against our insurance carriers  and their continued solvency 
for a further discussion of these estimates and how they may affect our future results  see critical accounting estimates asbestos liabilities and insurance assets 
asbestos liability and defense costs income is comprised of projected indemnity cost  changes in the projected asbestos liability  changes in the probable insurance recovery of the projected asbestos related liability  changes in the probable recovery of asbestos liability and defense costs paid in prior periods  and actual defense costs expensed in the period 
the table below presents asbestos liability and defense costs income for the periods indicated year ended december  amounts in millions asbestos liability and defense costs income asbestos liability and defense costs were million for the year ended december  compared to income of million for the year ended december  the increase in asbestos liability and defense costs was primarily attributable to a net pre tax gain of million recorded in  comprised of a million gain to increase the insurance asset as a result of favorable court rulings in october and december of concerning allocation methodology  partially offset by an million charge to increase asbestos related liabilities by million  offset by an increase to expected insurance recoveries of million arising from a revision to our year estimate of asbestos related liabilities 
additionally  the company recorded charges totaling million in the third and fourth quarters of as a result of developments in the litigation  which was partially offset by a million gain resulting from a settlement received from an insolvent carrier 
asbestos liability and defense income was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in asbestos liability and defense income relates primarily to the favorable effect of one time items in exceeding the favorable net effect of one time items in one time items in included a million gain resulting from resolution of a coverage dispute with a primary insurer concerning certain pre insurance policies  as well as a million gain from a change in estimate of our future asset recovery percentage for one subsidiary 
one time adjustments in include a million gain to increase the insurance asset as a result of favorable court rulings in october and december concerning allocation methodology offset by an million charge to increase asbestos related liabilities by million  offset by an increase to expected insurance recoveries of million  as a result of an analysis of claims data 
asbestos coverage litigation expense asbestos coverage litigation expenses include legal costs related to the actions against two of our subsidiaries respective insurers and a former parent company of one of the subsidiaries 
the table below presents coverage litigation expenses for the periods indicated year ended december  amounts in millions asbestos coverage litigation expenses legal costs related to the subsidiaries action against their asbestos insurers were million for the year ended december   million higher than the year ended december   due to costs related to the trial by one of our subsidiaries against a number of its insurers and former parent that began in january and is expected to conclude in legal costs for the year ended december  were higher than primarily due to trial preparation in the fourth quarter of the trial had been expected to commence in the first half of  but did not begin until january  seasonality we experience seasonality in our fluid handling business 
as our customers seek to fully utilize capital spending budgets before the end of the year  historically our shipments have peaked during the fourth quarter 
also  our european operations typically experience a slowdown during the july and august holiday season 
sales and orders our sales  orders and backlog are affected by many factors including but not limited to acquisitions  fluctuating foreign exchange rates  and growth decline in our existing businesses which may be driven by market conditions and other factors 
to facilitate the comparison between reporting periods  we disclose the impact of each of these three factors to the extent they impact the periods presented 
the impact of foreign currency translation is the difference between sales from existing businesses valued at current year foreign exchange rates and the same sales valued at prior year foreign exchange rates 
growth due to acquisitions includes incremental sales due to an acquisition during the period or incremental sales due to reporting a full year s sales for an acquisition that occurred in the prior year 
sales growth decline from existing businesses excludes both the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions  thus providing a measure of growth decline due to factors such as price  mix and volume 
orders and order backlog are highly indicative of our future revenue and thus are key measures of anticipated performance 
orders consist of contracts for products or services from our customers  net of cancellations  during a period 
order backlog consists of unfilled orders at the end of a period 
the components of order and backlog growth decline are presented on the same basis as sales growth decline 
the following tables present components of our sales and order growth decline  as well as  sales by fluid handling product for the periods indicated backlog at amounts in millions sales orders period end year ended december  components of change existing businesses acquisitions foreign currency translation total year ended december  components of change existing businesses acquisitions foreign currency translation total year ended december  year ended december  amounts in millions net sales by product pumps  including aftermarket parts and service systems  including installation service valves other total net sales as detailed above  sales from existing businesses increased for the year ended december  over the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to higher demand in all end markets except the oil and gas market 
foreign currency translation negatively impacted sales by  primarily due to a stronger average us dollar against the euro for year ended december  compared to the same period in orders  net of cancellations  from existing businesses increased for the year ended december  over the year ended december   primarily due to increased demand in the general industrial  commercial marine and oil and gas end markets  partially offset by lower demand in the defense end market 
we experienced commercial marine order cancellations of approximately million during the year ended december   compared to million during the year ended december  backlog as of december   of million decreased million  or from december   excluding the impact of foreign currency translation and acquisitions 
the baric acquisition added million to backlog in sales from existing businesses declined for the year ended december  over the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to a significant decline in sales volume in the general industrial end market resulting from the global economic downturn  partially offset by a sales volume increase in the global defense end market 
foreign currency translation negatively impacted sales and orders for the year ended december   primarily due to a stronger average us dollar against the euro for compared to orders  net of cancellations  from existing businesses for the year ended december  were down from the prior year  primarily due to a significant decline in demand in the commercial marine  oil and gas  general industrial and power generation end markets 
we experienced commercial marine order cancellations of approximately million during the year ended december   as a result of the economic downturn 
backlog as of december   of million decreased million  or  reflecting the decline in orders during the year 
gross profit the following table presents our gross profit and gross profit margin figures for the periods indicated year ended december  amounts in millions gross profit gross profit margin gross profit increased million for the year ended december  compared to the same period in gross profit from existing businesses increased million  with an additional increase of million due to the acquisitions of baric and pd technik 
foreign currency translation negatively impacted gross profit by million 
gross profit margin for the year ended december  was flat compared to the year ended december   as margin declines driven by lower pricing and an unfavorable product mix shift were partially offset by restructuring program cost savings and higher productivity 
gross profit decreased million for the year ended december  compared to the same period in gross profit from existing businesses decreased million  with an additional million negative impact of foreign exchange rates 
gross profit margin declined a modest basis points in despite a substantial decrease in production volume which caused lower absorption of fixed manufacturing costs 
significant restructuring program cost savings as well as favorable pricing and product mix in the commercial marine and general industrial end markets for the most part successfully mitigated the negative effect of volume on our gross margin 
selling  general and administrative expenses the following table presents our selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for the periods indicated year ended december  amounts in millions sg a expenses sg a expenses as a percentage of sales selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million for the year ended december  excluding a million net increase related to acquisitions and foreign exchange rates  sg a increased million from  primarily due to higher selling and commission costs and higher incentive compensation 
there was also a million increase in pension costs due to the company s assumption of the pension obligation for a group of former employees of a divested subsidiary as a result of an agreement reached in the fourth quarter of however  this was substantially offset by the reversal of an accrual established in prior years for this matter 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million to million for the year ended december  excluding the million favorable impact of foreign exchange rates  sg a declined million from  primarily due to reductions in selling and commission expenses of million and restructuring savings of million 
an additional million of professional fees and other costs associated with becoming a public company and million of pension and other postretirement benefit costs were incurred in  but were offset by lower legacy legal expenses and favorable changes in the fair value of commodity and foreign currency derivatives 
operating income the table below presents operating income data for the periods indicated year ended december  amounts in millions operating income operating margin operating income for the year ended december  decreased million from the year ended december  excluding a million net unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates and acquisitions  operating income decreased by million 
increased asbestos claims and litigation expenses and unfavorable pricing and product mix shift were partially offset by lower restructuring costs  higher sales volumes and manufacturing cost reductions  including restructuring program cost savings 
operating income for the year ended december  increased million from the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to the absence of million of ipo related costs incurred in  partially offset by million of restructuring costs incurred in as well as a million negative impact of foreign exchange rates 
excluding these impacts  operating income was million lower than the prior year  primarily due to lower sales volume from existing businesses  partially offset by lower asbestos related expenses and selling  general and administrative expenses 
interest expense for a description of our outstanding indebtedness  please refer to liquidity and capital resources below 
interest expense of million for the year ended december  declined million from the prior year 
a decrease in the notional value of our interest rate swap from million to million on june  caused our overall weighted average effective interest rate to decline  from in to in interest expense of million for the year ended december  declined million from the prior year  primarily due to lower debt levels during compared to as a result of debt repayments of million from a portion of the ipo proceeds in the second quarter of a decrease in the weighted average effective interest rate on our variable rate borrowings that are not hedged  from in to in contributed approximately million to the reduction in interest expense 
provision for income taxes the effective income tax rate for the year ended december  was as compared to an effective tax rate of for the year ended december  the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was higher than the us federal statutory rate primarily due to a net increase in our valuation allowance  offset in part by international tax rates which are lower than the us tax rate  and a net decrease to our unrecognized tax benefit liability 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was higher than the effective tax rate for the year ended december  primarily due a million increase in our valuation allowance in the effective income tax rate for the year ended december  was as compared to an effective tax rate of for the year ended december  our effective tax rate for the year ended december  was lower than the us federal statutory rate primarily due to international tax rates which are lower than the us tax rate  including the impact of the reduction in of the swedish tax rate from to offset in part by a net increase to our valuation allowance and unrecognized tax benefit liability 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was lower than the effective tax rate for the year ended december  primarily due to an million payment to reimburse certain selling shareholders for underwriters discounts that are not deductible for tax purposes and a million increase in valuation allowance in liquidity and capital resources overview historically  we have financed our capital and working capital requirements through a combination of cash flows from operating activities and borrowings under our credit facility 
we expect that our primary ongoing requirements for cash will be for working capital  funding for potential acquisitions  capital expenditures  asbestos related outflows and pension plan funding 
if additional funds are needed for strategic acquisitions or other corporate purposes  we believe we could raise additional funds in the form of debt or equity 
borrowings on may   coinciding with the closing of the ipo  we terminated our existing credit facility 
there were no material early termination penalties incurred as a result of the termination 
deferred loan costs of million were written off in connection with this termination 
on the same day  we entered into a new credit agreement the credit agreement 
the credit agreement  led by banc of america securities llc and administered by bank of america  is a senior secured structure with a million revolver and a term a note of million 
the term a note bears interest at libor plus a margin ranging from to determined by the total leverage ratio calculated at quarter end 
at december   the interest rate was inclusive of a margin 
the term a note  as entered into on may   has million due on a quarterly basis on the last day of each march  june  september and december beginning june  and ending march   and one installment of million payable on may  on december   there was million outstanding on the term a note 
the million revolver contains a million letter of credit sub facility  a million swing line loan sub facility and a million sub facility 
at december   the annual commitment fee on the revolver was and there was million outstanding on the letter of credit sub facility and million attributable to a defaulting lender  leaving approximately million available under our revolver 
on june   we entered into an interest rate swap with an aggregate notional value of million whereby we exchanged our libor based variable rate interest for a fixed rate of 
the notional value decreased to million on june  and will decrease to million on june   and expires on june  the fair value of the swap agreement  based on third party quotes  was a liability of million at december  the swap agreement has been designated as a cash flow hedge  and therefore changes in its fair value are recorded as an adjustment to other comprehensive income 
substantially all assets and stock of the company s domestic subsidiaries and of the shares of certain european subsidiaries are pledged as collateral against borrowings under the credit agreement 
certain european assets are pledged against borrowings directly made to our european subsidiary 
the credit agreement contains customary covenants limiting the company s ability to  among other things  pay cash dividends  incur debt or liens  redeem or repurchase company stock  enter into transactions with affiliates  make investments  merge or consolidate with others or dispose of assets 
in addition  the credit agreement contains financial covenants requiring the company to maintain a total leverage ratio of not more than to and a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than to  measured at the end of each quarter 
if the company does not comply with the various covenants under the credit agreement and related agreements  the lenders may  subject to various customary cure rights  require the immediate payment of all amounts outstanding under the term a note and revolver 
the company believes it is in compliance with all such covenants as of december  and expects to be in compliance for the next months 
as of december   we had approximately million available on our million revolving credit line 
present drawings under the credit line are letters of credit securing various obligations related to our business

net cash provided by used in operating activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the two most significant items causing the variability in these reported amounts were asbestos related cash flows including the disposition of claims  defense costs  insurer reimbursements and settlements and legal expenses related to litigation against our insurers and ipo related costs in for the years ended december   and  net cash paid for asbestos liabilities  net of insurance settlements received  was million  million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   cash paid for ipo related costs were million 
additionally  in the year ended december   cash paid for legacy legal settlements were million 
excluding the effect of asbestos related cash flows  ipo related costs  and legacy legal settlements  net cash provided by operating activities would have been million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
other changes in operating cash flow items are discussed below 
funding requirements of our defined benefit plans  including both pensions and other post employment benefits  can vary significantly among periods due to changes in the fair value of plan assets and actuarial assumptions 
for the years ended december   and  cash contributions for defined benefit plans were million  million  and million  respectively 
for the years ended december  and  cash payments of million and million  respectively  were made related to the company s restructuring initiatives 
changes in working capital also affected the operating cash flows for the years presented 
we define working capital as trade receivables plus inventories less accounts payable 
working capital  excluding the effects of acquisitions and foreign currency translation  decreased million from december  to december  and decreased million from december  to december  these changes were primarily due to decreases in inventory levels as a result of inventory reduction programs 
investing activities consist primarily of purchases of fixed assets and cash paid for acquisitions 
in all years presented  capital expenditures were invested in new and replacement machinery  equipment and information technology 
we generally target capital expenditures at approximately to of revenues 
on august   we completed the acquisition of baric  a supplier of highly engineered fluid handling systems primarily for lubrication applications  with its primary operations based in blyth  united kingdom  for million  net of cash acquired in the transaction 
we paid million in and million in both and for contingent purchase price adjustments related to our acquisition of fairmount automation  inc on august   we completed the acquisition of pd technik  a provider of marine aftermarket related products and services located in hamburg  germany  for million  net of cash acquired in the transaction 
financing cash flows consist primarily of borrowings and repayments of indebtedness  payment of dividends to shareholders and redemptions of stock 
during  we repaid million of long term borrowings 
in the fourth quarter of  we purchased  shares of our common stock for approximately million 
we did not purchase any shares in or our ipo proceeds in may were million after deducting estimated accounting  legal and other expenses of million 
we used these proceeds to i repay approximately million of indebtedness outstanding under our credit facility  ii pay dividends to existing preferred stockholders of record immediately prior to the consummation of the ipo in the amount of million  iii pay million to the selling stockholders in the ipo as reimbursement for the underwriting discount incurred on the shares sold by them  and iv pay special bonuses of approximately million to certain of our executives under previously adopted executive compensation plans 
the remainder of the net proceeds was applied to working capital 
we paid approximately million in deferred loan costs related to our new credit facility entered into may  contractual obligations we are party to numerous contracts and arrangements that obligate us to make cash payments in future years 
these contracts include financing arrangements such as debt agreements and leases  as well as contracts for the purchase of goods and services 
the following table is a summary of our contractual obligations as of december  in millions total less than one year years years more than years debt leases term loan a interest payments on long term debt operating leases purchase obligations total includes estimated interest rate swap payments 
variable interest payments are estimated using a static rate of 
amounts exclude open purchase orders for goods or services that are provided on demand  the timing of which is not certain 
we have cash funding requirements associated with our pension and other post retirement benefit plans  which are estimated to be approximately million for the year ending december  other long term liabilities  such as those for asbestos and other legal claims  employee benefit plan obligations  and deferred income taxes  are excluded from the above table since they are not contractually fixed as to timing and amount 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that provide liquidity  capital resources  market or credit risk support that expose us to any liability that is not reflected in our consolidated financial statements other than outstanding letters of credit of million and million of bank guarantees at december  and future operating lease payments of million 
the company and its subsidiaries have in the past divested certain of its businesses and assets 
in connection with these divestitures  certain representations  warranties and indemnities were made to purchasers to cover various risks or unknown liabilities 
we cannot estimate the potential liability  if any  that may result from such representations  warranties and indemnities because they relate to unknown and unexpected contingencies  however  the company does not believe that any such liabilities will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
critical accounting policies the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
our estimates are based upon our historical experience  our evaluation of business and macroeconomic trends  and information from other outside sources as appropriate 
our experience and assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may vary from what our management anticipates and different assumptions or estimates about the future could change our reported results 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical in that they are important to the financial statements and they require the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of the financial statements 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
asbestos liabilities and insurance assets two of our subsidiaries are each one of many defendants in a large number of lawsuits that claim personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos from products manufactured with components that are alleged to have contained asbestos 
such components were acquired from third party suppliers  and were not manufactured by any of our subsidiaries nor were the subsidiaries producers or direct suppliers of asbestos 
the manufactured products that are alleged to have contained asbestos generally were provided to meet the specifications of the subsidiaries customers  including the us navy 
the subsidiaries settle asbestos claims for amounts management considers reasonable given the facts and circumstances of each claim 
the annual average settlement payment per asbestos claimant has fluctuated during the past several years 
management expects such fluctuations to continue in the future based upon  among other things  the number and type of claims settled in a particular period and the jurisdictions in which such claims arise 
to date  the majority of settled claims have been dismissed for no payment 
claims activity related to asbestos is as follows year ended december  claims unresolved at the beginning of the period claims filed claims resolved claims unresolved at the end of the period average cost of resolved claims excludes claims filed by one legal firm that have been administratively dismissed 
claims filed include all asbestos claims for which notification has been received or a file has been opened 
claims resolved include asbestos claims that have been settled or dismissed or that are in the process of being settled or dismissed based upon agreements or understandings in place with counsel for the claimants 
average cost of settlement to resolve claims in whole dollars 
these amounts exclude claims settled in mississippi for which the majority of claims have historically been resolved for no payment 
these amounts exclude insurance recoveries 
the increase in average cost of resolved claims from to is driven primarily by a shift in the mix of settled claims from dismissals with no dollar value to mesothelioma settlements 
we have projected each subsidiary s future asbestos related liability costs with regard to pending and future unasserted claims based upon the nicholson methodology 
the nicholson methodology is a standard approach used by experts and has been accepted by numerous courts 
this methodology is based upon risk equations  exposed population estimates  mortality rates  and other demographic statistics 
in applying the nicholson methodology for each subsidiary we performed an analysis of the estimated population likely to have been exposed or claim to have been exposed to products manufactured by the subsidiaries based upon national studies undertaken of the population of workers believed to have been exposed to asbestos  the use of epidemiological and demographic studies to estimate the number of potentially exposed people that would be likely to develop asbestos related diseases in each year  an analysis of the subsidiaries recent claims history to estimate likely filing rates for these diseases  and an analysis of the historical asbestos liability costs to develop average values  which vary by disease type  jurisdiction and the nature of claim  to determine an estimate of costs likely to be associated with currently pending and projected asbestos claims 
our projections  based upon the nicholson methodology  estimate both claims and the estimated cash outflows related to the resolution of such claims for periods up to and including the endpoint of asbestos studies referred to in item above 
it is our policy to record a liability for asbestos related liability costs for the longest period of time that we can reasonably estimate 
projecting future asbestos related liability costs is subject to numerous variables that are difficult to predict  including  among others  the number of claims that might be received  the type and severity of the disease alleged by each claimant  the latency period associated with asbestos exposure  dismissal rates  costs of medical treatment  the financial resources of other companies that are co defendants in the claims  funds available in post bankruptcy trusts  uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case  including fluctuations in the timing of court actions and rulings  and the impact of potential changes in legislative or judicial standards  including potential tort reform 
furthermore  any projections with respect to these variables are subject to even greater uncertainty as the projection period lengthens 
these trend factors have both positive and negative effects on the dynamics of asbestos litigation in the tort system and the related best estimate of our asbestos liability  and these effects do not move in linear fashion but rather change over multiple year periods 
accordingly  we monitor these trend factors over time and periodically assesses whether an alternative forecast period is appropriate 
taking these factors into account and the inherent uncertainties  we believe that we can reasonably estimate the asbestos related liability for pending and future claims that will be resolved in the next years and have recorded that liability as our best estimate 
while it is reasonably possible that the subsidiaries will incur costs after this period  we do not believe the reasonably possible loss or range of reasonably possible loss is estimable at the current time 
accordingly  no accrual has been recorded for any costs which may be paid after the next years 
defense costs associated with asbestos related liabilities as well as costs incurred related to litigation against the subsidiaries insurers are expensed as incurred 
we assessed the subsidiaries existing insurance arrangements and agreements  estimated the applicability of insurance coverage for existing and expected future claims  analyzed publicly available information bearing on the current creditworthiness and solvency of the various insurers  and employed such insurance allocation methodologies as we believed appropriate to ascertain the probable insurance recoveries for asbestos liabilities 
the analysis took into account self insurance retentions  policy exclusions  pending litigation  liability caps and gaps in coverage  existing and potential insolvencies of insurers as well as how legal and defense costs will be covered under the insurance policies 
during the third quarter of  an analysis of claims data including filing and dismissal rates  alleged disease mix  filing jurisdiction  as well as settlement values resulted in the determination that the company should revise its rolling year estimate of asbestos related liability for pending and future claims 
the analysis reflected that a statistically significant increase in mesothelioma filings had occurred and was expected to continue for both subsidiaries 
as a result  the company recorded an million pretax charge in the third quarter of  which was comprised of an increase to its asbestos related liabilities of million offset by expected insurance recoveries of million 
each subsidiary has separate insurance coverage acquired prior to company ownership of each independent entity 
in its evaluation of the insurance asset  the company used differing insurance allocation methodologies for each subsidiary based upon the applicable law pertaining to the affected subsidiary 
in november  one of the subsidiaries entered into a settlement agreement with the primary and umbrella carrier governing all aspects of the carrier s past and future handling of the asbestos related bodily injury claims against the subsidiary 
as a result of this agreement  during the third quarter of  the company increased its insurance asset by million attributable to resolution of a dispute concerning certain pre insurance policies and recorded a corresponding pretax gain 
the company reimbursed the primary insurer for million in deductibles and retrospective premiums in the fourth quarter of and has no further liability to the insurer under these provisions of the primary policies 
for this subsidiary  the delaware court of chancery ruled on october   that asbestos related costs should be allocated among excess insurers using an all sums allocation which allows an insured to collect all sums paid in connection with a claim from any insurer whose policy is triggered  up to the policy s applicable limits and that the subsidiary has rights to excess insurance policies purchased by a former owner of the business 
based upon this ruling mandating an all sums allocation  as well as the language of the underlying insurance policies and the assertion and belief that defense costs are outside policy limits  the company  as of october   increased its future expected recovery percentage from to of asbestos related costs following the exhaustion of its primary and umbrella layers of insurance and recorded a pretax gain of million 
the subsidiary expects to be responsible for approximately of its future asbestos related costs 
during the third quarter of  an insolvent carrier that had written approximately million in limits for which this subsidiary had assumed no recovery made a cash settlement offer of approximately million 
as such  the subsidiary recorded a gain for this amount and a receivable from the insurer 
the subsidiary was notified during the third quarter of by the primary and umbrella carrier who had been fully defending and indemnifying the subsidiary for twenty years that the limits of liability of its primary and umbrella layer policies had been exhausted 
since then  the subsidiary has sought coverage from certain excess layer insurers whose terms and conditions follow form to the umbrella carrier 
certain first layer excess insurers have defended and or indemnified the subsidiary and or agreed to defend and or indemnify the subsidiary  subject to their reservations of rights and their applicable policy limits 
litigation between this subsidiary and its excess insurers is continuing and it is anticipated that the trial phase will be completed in the subsidiary continues to work with its excess insurers to obtain defense and indemnity payments while the litigation is proceeding 
given the uncertainties of litigation  there are a variety of possible outcomes  including but not limited to the subsidiary being required to fund all or a portion of the subsidiary s defense and indemnity payments until such time a final ruling orders payment by the insurers 
while not impacting the results of operations  the funding requirement could range up to million per quarter until final resolution 
in  the other subsidiary filed a lawsuit against a large number of its insurers and its former parent to resolve a variety of disputes concerning insurance for asbestos related bodily injury claims asserted against it 
although none of these insurance companies contested coverage  they disputed the timing  reasonableness and allocation of payments 
for this subsidiary it was determined by court ruling in the fourth quarter of  that the allocation methodology mandated by the new jersey courts will apply 
further court rulings in december of  clarified the allocation calculation related to amounts currently due from insurers as well as amounts the company expects to be reimbursed for asbestos related costs incurred in future periods 
as a result  in the fourth quarter of  the company increased its receivable for past costs by million and decreased its insurance asset for future costs by million and recorded a pretax gain of million 
in connection with this litigation  the court engaged a special master to review the appropriate information and recommend an allocation formula in accordance with applicable law and the facts of the case 
during the fourth quarter of  the court appointed special allocation master made its recommendation which has not yet been and may not be accepted by the court 
based upon the recommendation  the company reduced the current asbestos receivable by million  increased the long term asbestos asset by million and recorded a net charge to asbestos liability and defense costs of million in the third quarter of as a result of the current status of this litigation  we decreased the amount currently due from insurers by million and decreased the insurance asset for future periods by million and recorded a pretax loss of million in the fourth quarter of we currently anticipate that the trial phase in this litigation will be complete in we cannot predict the outcome of this litigation with certainty  or whether the outcome will be more or less favorable than our best estimate included in the consolidated financial statements 
given the uncertainty inherent in litigation  we would estimate the range of possible results from positive million to negative million relative to our reported insurance assets on our consolidated balance sheets 
the timing of any cash inflows or outflows related to these matters cannot be estimated 
the subsidiary expects to be responsible for approximately of all future asbestos related costs 
the company has established reserves of million and million as of december  and december   respectively  for the probable and reasonably estimable asbestos related liability cost it believes the subsidiaries will pay through the next years 
it has also established recoverables of million and million as of december  and december   respectively  for the insurance recoveries that are deemed probable during the same time period 
net of these recoverables  the expected cash outlay on a non discounted basis for asbestos related bodily injury claims over the next years was million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
in addition  the company has recorded a receivable for liability and defense costs previously paid in the amount of million and million as of december  and december   respectively  for which insurance recovery is deemed probable 
the company has recorded the reserves for the asbestos liabilities as accrued asbestos liability and long term asbestos liability and the related insurance recoveries as asbestos insurance asset and long term asbestos insurance asset 
the receivable for previously paid liability and defense costs is recorded in asbestos insurance receivable and long term asbestos insurance receivable 
the company also has reflected in other accrued liabilities million and million as of december  and december   respectively  for overpayments by certain insurers and unpaid legal costs related to defending itself against asbestos related liability claims and legal action against the company s insurers 
the expense income related to these liabilities and legal defense was million  net of estimated insurance recoveries  for the year ended december  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
legal costs related to the subsidiaries action against their asbestos insurers were million for the year ended december  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
management s analyses are based on currently known facts and a number of assumptions 
however  projecting future events  such as new claims to be filed each year  the average cost of resolving each claim  coverage issues among layers of insurers  the method in which losses will be allocated to the various insurance policies  interpretation of the effect on coverage of various policy terms and limits and their interrelationships  the continuing solvency of various insurance companies  the amount of remaining insurance available  as well as the numerous uncertainties inherent in asbestos litigation could cause the actual liabilities and insurance recoveries to be higher or lower than those projected or recorded which could materially affect our financial condition  results of operations or cash flow 
retirement benefits pension obligations and other post retirement benefits are actuarially determined and are affected by several assumptions  including the discount rate  assumed annual rates of return on plan assets  and per capita cost of covered health care benefits 
changes in discount rate and differences from actual results for each assumption will affect the amounts of pension expense and other post retirement expense recognized in future periods 
these assumptions may also have an effect on the amount and timing of future cash contributions 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further information 
impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets goodwill represents the costs in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired associated with our acquisitions 
we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets annually or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change in the interim that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount 
goodwill is considered to be impaired when the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
during the year ended december   the company changed the date of its annual goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets impairment testing from the last day of the fourth quarter to the first day of the fourth quarter 
the company adopted this change in timing in order to provide additional time to quantify the fair value of our reporting units and  if necessary  to determine the implied fair value of goodwill 
this change in timing will also reduce the likelihood that the annual impairment analysis would not be completed by the required filing date of the company s annual financial statements 
the revised date also better aligns with our strategic planning and budgeting process  which is an integral component of the impairment testing 
in accordance with gaap  the company will also perform interim impairment testing should circumstances requiring it arise 
we believe this accounting change is preferable and does not result in the delay  acceleration  or avoidance of an impairment charge 
in the evaluation of goodwill for impairment  we first compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and step two of the impairment analysis is performed 
in step two of the analysis  an impairment loss is recorded equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill over its implied fair value should such a circumstance arise 
we measure fair value of reporting units based on a present value of future discounted cash flows or a market valuation approach 
the discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting units based on the present value of the cash flows that the reporting units are expected to generate in the future 
significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include the weighted average cost of capital  long term rate of growth and profitability of our business  and working capital effects 
the market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the company against certain market information 
significant estimates in the market approach model include identifying appropriate market multiples and assessing earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda in estimating the fair value of the reporting units 
the analysis performed as of october  and december  and indicated no impairment to be present 
however  actual results could differ from our estimates and projections  which would affect the assessment of impairment 
as of december   we have goodwill of million that is subject to at least annual review of impairment 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further information 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance  we take into account various factors  including the expected level of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies 
if actual results differ from the assumptions made in the evaluation of our valuation allowance  we record a change in valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period such determination is made 
during the year ending december   the valuation allowance increased from million to million with million and million of the increase recognized in income tax expense and in other comprehensive income  respectively 
the million net increase in was primarily attributable to us deferred tax assets we believe may not be realized 
consideration was given to us tax planning strategies and future us taxable income as to how much of the total us deferred tax asset could be realized on a more likely than not basis 
the determination of our provision for income tax requires significant judgment  the use of estimates  and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws 
significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items 
we establish reserves when  despite the belief that the tax return positions are fully supportable  we believe that certain positions may be successfully challenged 
when facts and circumstances change  the reserves are adjusted through the provision for income taxes 
tax benefits are not recognized until minimum recognition thresholds are met as prescribed by applicable accounting standards 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues and costs from product sales when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  product delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  there are no further obligations to customers  and collectibility is probable 
product delivery occurs when title and risk of loss transfer to the customer 
our shipping terms vary based on the contract 
if any significant obligations to the customer with respect to such sale remain to be fulfilled following shipment  typically involving obligations relating to installation and acceptance by the buyer  revenue recognition is deferred until such obligations have been fulfilled 
any customer allowances and discounts are recorded as a reduction in reported revenues at the time of sale because these allowances reflect a reduction in the purchase price for the products purchased 
these allowances and discounts are estimated based on historical experience and known trends 
revenue related to service agreements is recognized as revenue over the term of the agreement 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
these allowances are based on recent trends of certain customers estimated to be a greater credit risk as well as general trends of the entire pool of customers 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the foregoing criteria are used for all classes of customers including original equipment manufacturers  distributors  government contractors and other end users 
stock based compensation pursuant to our omnibus incentive plan  our board of directors may make awards in the form of shares of restricted stock  stock options and restricted stock units rsus and other stock based awards 
we measure and recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award  with limited exceptions 
that cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award the requisite service period or vesting period 
no compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service 
we have equity incentive plans to encourage employees and non employee directors to remain with us and to more closely align their interests with those of our shareholders 
for purposes of calculating stock based compensation  the fair value of restricted stock or restricted stock units granted is equal to the market value of a share of common stock on the date of the grant 
for grants that were awarded on may  in conjunction with our initial public offering  we used the initial public offering price as the fair value of the restricted stock and restricted stock units granted 
for stock options  we estimate the fair value on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the determination of fair value using the black scholes model requires a number of complex and subjective variables 
one key input into the model is the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant  the initial public offering price in the case of stock options issued on may  other key variables in the black scholes option pricing model include the expected volatility of our common stock price  the expected term of the award and the risk free interest rate 
in addition  we are required to estimate forfeitures of unvested awards when recognizing compensation expense 
significant assumptions used to calculate stock based compensation during the years ended december  and were a stock price volatility of and  respectively  an expected option life of years  a risk free interest rate based on the year treasury note yield on the date of grant ranging from to in and to in and a expected dividend yield 
stock based compensation expense recognized for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
we cannot predict with certainty the impact of stock compensation expense to be recognized in the future because the actual amount of stock based compensation expense we record in any fiscal period will be dependent on a number of factors  including the number of shares subject to the stock awards issued  the fair value of our common stock at the time of issuance and the expected volatility of our stock price over time 
however  based on awards we currently expect to make in  stock based compensation for the year ended december  is projected to be approximately million

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices that could impact our results of operations and financial condition 
we address our exposure to these risks through our normal operating and financing activities 
information concerning market risk for the year ended december  is discussed below 
interest rate risk we are subject to exposure from changes in interest rates based on our financing activities 
under our credit facility  all of our borrowings at december  are variable rate facilities based on libor or euribor 
in order to mitigate our interest rate risk  we periodically enter into interest rate swap or collar agreements 
a hypothetical increase in the interest rate of during on our variable rate debt that is not hedged would have increased our interest cost by approximately million 
on june   we entered into an interest rate swap with an aggregate notional value of million whereby we exchanged our libor based variable rate interest for a fixed rate of 
the notional value decreased to million on june  and will decrease to million on june   and expires on june  the fair value of the swap agreement  based on third party quotes  was a liability of million at december  the swap agreement has been designated as a cash flow hedge  and therefore changes in its fair value are recorded as an adjustment to other comprehensive income 
exchange rate risk we have manufacturing sites throughout the world and sell our products globally 
as a result  we are exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the us dollar and against the currencies of other countries in which we manufacture and sell products and services 
during  approximately of our sales were derived from operations outside the us  with approximately generated from our european operations 
in particular  we have more sales in european currencies than we have expenses in those currencies 
therefore  when european currencies strengthen or weaken against the us dollar  operating profits are increased or decreased  respectively 
to assist with the matching of revenues and expenses and assets and liabilities in foreign currencies  we may periodically enter into derivative instruments such as cross currency swaps or forward contracts 
to illustrate the potential impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  assuming a increase in average foreign exchange rates compared to the us dollar  income before income taxes would have increased by million 
commodity price risk we are exposed to changes in the prices of raw materials used in our production processes 
commodity futures contracts are periodically used to manage such exposure 
as of december   we had no open commodity futures contracts
