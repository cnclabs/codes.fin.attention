competition st 
charles ameristar st 
charles competes with five other gaming operations located in the metropolitan st 
louis area 
two of these competitors are located in illinois 
the st 
louis market is currently insulated from other casino gaming markets  with no competitors within miles 
in march  a gaming operator opened a new casino facility in lemay  which is located in the southeastern portion of st 
louis county  approximately miles from our st 
charles property 
ameristar s location is the farthest of the missouri based casinos in the st 
louis area from the new casino 
in january  the missouri gaming commission approved the revocation of the gaming license of a competitor in downtown st 
louis 
the casino operator surrendered the license and the casino was closed in june in december  the missouri gaming commission allowed a different operator to commence construction of a new casino property in cape girardeau  missouri  approximately miles southeast of the st 
louis market 
construction of that property is expected to begin in the summer of assuming the successful completion and licensing of the cape girardeau property  no additional gaming licenses will be awarded in the state of missouri as the number of permitted casinos was capped at by referendum in we currently do not anticipate any new competition in the illinois portion of the st 
louis market 
however  increased competition for our st 
charles property would result if illinois law is changed in the future to allow the operation of slot machines at the existing pari mutuel racetrack near east st 
louis 
this has been proposed from time to time by members of the illinois legislature 
kansas city ameristar kansas city competes with three other gaming operations located in and around kansas city  missouri 
in  the kansas legislature enacted a law that authorizes up to four state owned and operated freestanding casinos and three racetrack slot machine parlors developed and managed by third parties 
one casino and one racetrack location are authorized in the kansas city market 
currently  the racetrack is closed and it is unclear if it will reopen with slot machines due to the high tax rate imposed on such operations 
in  the kansas lottery gaming facility review board granted approval for a casino and entertainment facility to be constructed at the kansas speedway in wyandotte county  kansas  approximately miles from ameristar kansas city 
the first phase of the project includes a casino  restaurants and other entertainment options and is projected to open in the first half of with the opening of the new kansas casino  we will face additional competition at ameristar kansas city 
however  ameristar kansas city s location is the farthest east from the new kansas casino development  which may mitigate the impact of the new casino 

table of contents council bluffs ameristar council bluffs operates one of three gaming licenses issued for the council bluffs gaming market pursuant to an operating agreement with iowa west racing association 
the two other licenses are operated by a single company and consist of another riverboat casino and a land based casino with a pari mutuel racetrack 
in  the land based competitor opened a nationally branded room hotel adjacent to its casino 
the council bluffs market is currently insulated from other casino gaming markets  with the nearest competitor located approximately miles away 
in  the national indian gaming commission the nigc approved the request of the ponca tribe of nebraska to allow a five acre parcel owned by the tribe in carter lake  iowa to be utilized for gaming purposes 
the parcel is located approximately five miles from ameristar council bluffs 
in  in a lawsuit brought by the state of nebraska and joined by the state of iowa and the city of council bluffs  the federal district court reversed the nigc s decision 
the us department of the interior appealed the district court ruling  and in the eighth circuit court of appeals reversed the district court s decision and ordered the court to remand the matter to the nigc for further consideration 
the court of appeals directed the nigc to revisit the issue  taking into consideration  among other things  a agreement between the state of iowa and the bureau of indian affairs 
that agreement stated that the five acre parcel would be utilized for a health center and not for gaming purposes 
if the tribe is allowed to conduct gaming at this location  the additional competition would adversely affect our council bluffs casino 
black hawk ameristar black hawk competes with other gaming operations located in the black hawk and central city gaming markets in colorado 
ameristar has the largest single gaming floor and parking garage of any casino in the market 
of the other casinos in the market  only two are considered large operators  with over slot machines 
ameristar s primary competitor is one of the first major casinos encountered when entering black hawk from denver via state route this competitor s primary casino is connected via a skywalk to an adjacent casino the operator also owns  thereby offering increased availability of hotel rooms  parking capacity and gaming positions to guests 
in  colorado voters approved amendment  which gave local gaming jurisdictions the option of increasing bet limits  expanding permitted table games and increasing the hours of operation 
in july  the positive regulatory changes were implemented statewide  allowing the ameristar black hawk property to extend casino operating hours from hours daily to hours daily  increase the maximum single bet limit from to up to and offer additional table games  including roulette and craps 
in september  ameristar opened a room luxury hotel and spa featuring upscale furnishings and amenities 
the hotel includes a versatile meeting and ballroom center and also has black hawk s only full service spa and an enclosed rooftop swimming pool with indoor outdoor whirlpool facilities 
ameristar black hawk offers destination resort amenities and services that we believe are unequaled in the denver gaming market 
the completed hotel also effectively doubled the room capacity in the black hawk market 
the black hawk and central city gaming market is currently insulated from other casino gaming markets  with no competitors within miles 
there have been several proposals for the development of native american and racetrack casinos in the denver metropolitan area over the years 
both types of casinos have been defeated in past ballot initiatives 
should additional gaming development occur in the denver metropolitan area  the black hawk and central city market would face increased competition 
vicksburg ameristar vicksburg currently competes with four other gaming operations located in vicksburg  mississippi 
vicksburg is located approximately miles west of mississippi s largest city  jackson 
proposals have been made from time to time to develop new native american casinos in louisiana and mississippi  some of which could be competitive with the vicksburg market 
none are under construction currently 
the vicksburg market also faces competition from two casinos owned by a native american tribe in philadelphia  mississippi  located about miles east of jackson and miles east of vicksburg 
vicksburg is also 
table of contents subject to competition from four casinos and one slots only racetrack in shreveport and bossier city  louisiana  located approximately miles from vicksburg  as well as casinos located along the mississippi gulf coast 
east chicago ameristar east chicago s core competitive market of northwest indiana is comprised of three casino operators  including ameristar  and includes east chicago  hammond and gary  indiana 
the three properties are located within five miles of each other on lake michigan 
the property also competes with six other casinos located in illinois  indiana and michigan within miles of east chicago 
illinois casinos are subject to higher gaming taxes than indiana casinos 
they are also subject to gaming position limitations and a statewide indoor smoking ban 
located within the chicago metropolitan area  ameristar east chicago currently draws approximately of its guest base from illinois  with the remaining coming from northwest indiana and surrounding areas 
in  the illinois gaming board the igb awarded the exclusive right to apply for the tenth and final illinois casino license to a company proposing a casino entertainment complex in des plaines  illinois  which is approximately miles northwest of east chicago  indiana 
in  the igb found the developer suitable for the operation of the license 
the project calls for a million casino and entertainment complex 
the facility is currently under construction and is expected to open in late legislation regarding the possible further expansion of gaming in illinois may be considered by illinois lawmakers 
if enacted  the legislation could lead to a significant level of additional competition in the chicagoland market 
in  the indiana department of transportation indot permanently closed the cline avenue bridge near ameristar east chicago due to safety concerns discovered during an inspection of the bridge 
the closure has forced ameristar s guests to utilize local arterial roads to access the property 
access via these roads is less convenient  which has caused the property s business levels and operating results to suffer 
indot is in the process of improving access  however  it has stated that it does not intend to rebuild the bridge due to the high cost 
jackpot the jackpot properties compete with three other hotels and motels all of which also have casinos in jackpot and a native american casino near pocatello  idaho 
the native american casino operates video lottery terminals  which are similar to slot machines 
other in addition to the competition that our properties face from other casinos in their geographic markets  we also compete  to a lesser extent  with casinos in other locations  including major tourist destinations such as las vegas  with gaming on cruise ships and with other forms of gaming in the united states  including state sponsored lotteries  racetracks  off track wagering  internet and other account wagering and card parlors 
employees and labor relations as of march   we employed approximately  full time and  part time employees 
approximately employees at our east chicago property are employed pursuant to collective bargaining agreements 
we believe our employee relations are good

you can find more information concerning the repurchase transaction and the refinancing in our current report on form k filed with the securities and exchange commission on february  item a 
risk factors our business is sensitive to reductions in discretionary consumer spending 
our business has been and may continue to be adversely affected by the economic downturn currently being experienced in the united states  as we are highly dependent on discretionary spending by our guests 
we are not able to predict the length or severity of the downturn 
changes in discretionary consumer spending or consumer preferences brought about by factors such as increased or continuing high unemployment  significant increases in energy prices  perceived or actual deterioration in general economic conditions  the protracted disruption in the housing markets  the availability of credit  perceived or actual decline in disposable consumer income and wealth including declines resulting from any increase in personal income tax rates and changes in consumer confidence in the economy may continue to reduce customer demand for the leisure activities we offer and adversely affect our revenues and cash flow 

table of contents we have substantial debt and intend to incur significant additional debt through the refinancing  leverage may impair our financial condition and restrict our operations 
we currently have a substantial amount of debt 
as of december   our total consolidated debt was billion 
pursuant to the estate agreement  we are required to use our reasonable best efforts to obtain new debt financing satisfactory to us new financing with sufficient borrowing capacity to enable us to retire our existing senior credit facilities and our senior unsecured notes and fund the repurchase transaction 
if we are able to obtain the new financing  we anticipate that by june  our total consolidated debt will increase to approximately billion  consisting of a combination of new senior secured credit facilities and unsecured notes 
upon consummation of the refinancing and the repurchase transaction  for accounting purposes  our total liabilities will exceed our total assets 
subject to specified limitations  the indenture governing our senior unsecured notes permits us to incur substantial additional debt 
in addition  our senior credit facilities permit us to borrow up to an additional million as of december  subject to the maintenance of required debt covenant ratios 
the revolving credit facility requires commitment reductions of million each quarter from december  through june   with the remaining balance of loans due august  our term loan requires million principal payments due quarterly from december  through june   with the remaining balance of million due november  our substantial debt and the additional debt we incur as a result of the refinancing could have important consequences to our business  including increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions  requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations for the payment of interest on our debt and reducing our ability to use our cash flows to fund working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  dividends  stock repurchases and general corporate requirements  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  and placing us at a competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors 
servicing our debt will require a significant amount of cash  which we expect to increase following the refinancing  and our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors  some of which are beyond our control 
our ability to make payments on and refinance our debt and to fund capital expenditures depends on our ability to generate cash flow in the future 
if we obtain new financing  our debt service requirements will increase substantially due to the higher principal amount of debt that will be outstanding 
to some extent  our ability to generate future cash flow is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative and regulatory factors and other factors that are beyond our control 
in addition  the ability to borrow funds under our existing senior credit facilities or replacement credit facilities in the future will depend on our satisfying the financial covenants in the agreement governing such facilities 
we cannot assure that our business will generate cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under our senior credit facilities in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund other liquidity needs 
our extended revolving loan commitments mature in august and our term loan matures in november we will need to refinance all or a portion of our debt before maturity and  as noted above  we intend to consummate the refinancing in the second quarter of we cannot assure that we will be able to obtain new financing satisfactory to us or to refinance any of our debt on favorable terms 
any inability to generate sufficient cash flow or refinance our debt on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

table of contents covenant restrictions under our senior credit facilities and the indenture governing our senior notes and any new financing may limit our ability to operate our business 
the agreement governing our existing senior credit facilities and the indenture governing our senior notes contain covenants that restrict our ability to  among other things  borrow money  pay dividends  make capital expenditures and effect a consolidation  merger or disposal of all or substantially all of our assets 
although the covenants in our senior credit facilities and the indenture are subject to various exceptions  we cannot assure you that these covenants will not adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other activities that may be in our best interest 
in addition  our long term debt requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy certain financial condition tests  which may require that we take action to reduce our debt or to act in a manner contrary to our business objectives 
a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our senior credit facilities and the indenture 
if an event of default under our senior credit facilities occurs  the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder  together with accrued interest  to be immediately due and payable 
in addition  our senior credit facilities are secured by first priority security interests on substantially all of our real and personal property  including the capital stock of our subsidiaries 
if we are unable to pay all amounts declared due and payable in the event of a default  the lenders could foreclose on these assets 
we expect that any new financing that we obtain will contain generally similar covenants and provisions 
the gaming industry is very competitive and increased competition could have a material adverse effect on our future operations 
the gaming industry is very competitive  and we face dynamic competitive pressures in each of our markets 
several of our competitors are larger and have greater financial and other resources 
we may choose or be required to take actions in response to competitors that may increase our marketing costs and other operating expenses 
our operating properties are located in jurisdictions that restrict gaming to certain areas or are adjacent to states that prohibit or restrict gaming operations 
these restrictions and prohibitions provide substantial benefits to our business and our ability to attract and retain guests 
the legalization or expanded legalization or authorization of gaming within or near a market area of one of our properties could result in a significant increase in competition and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
economic difficulties faced by state governments  as well as the increased acceptance of gaming as a leisure activity  could lead to intensified political pressure for the expansion of legalized gaming 
in  the kansas legislature enacted a law that authorizes up to four state owned and operated freestanding casinos and three racetrack slot machine parlors developed and managed by third parties 
at that time  one casino and one racetrack location were authorized in wyandotte county in the greater kansas city market 
the owner of the potential racetrack slot machine parlor license surrendered its racing license and closed the facility due to concerns about the tax rate that would apply to its gaming operations  which was substantially higher than the tax rate in missouri or applicable to kansas freestanding casinos 
the future status of the racetrack license is uncertain  however  there have been discussions about reducing the tax rate in order to incentivize the installation of slot machines at the racetracks and reduce the state s budget deficit 
in february  the kansas lottery gaming facility review board approved a proposal by a partnership that includes a major commercial casino operator to develop a large land based casino and entertainment facility at the kansas speedway  approximately miles from ameristar kansas city 
construction of the first phase of the project is underway and it is expected to open in the first half of this facility will provide significant additional competition for ameristar kansas city that could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations of that property 
our east chicago property currently competes with seven other casino gaming facilities in the chicagoland market in indiana and illinois and with one native american casino in michigan 
one of our property s principal competitors is located in hammond  indiana  which is closer to and has significantly better access for customers who live in chicago  illinois and the chicago suburbs that are the primary feeder markets for ameristar east chicago 
the hammond facility opened a million expansion in that has adversely affected our property s business  particularly table games and poker  and we expect will continue to do so 
in december  the illinois gaming board awarded the exclusive right to apply for the tenth and final illinois casino license to a developer for a property in des plaines  illinois  located approximately miles from 
table of contents ameristar east chicago 
construction is underway and that facility is expected to open in late from time to time  the illinois general assembly has also considered other forms of gaming expansion in the state 
in december  the illinois senate passed a measure that would have authorized one land based casino in the city of chicago  four new riverboat casinos in downstate illinois  slot machines at the existing racetracks and at chicago s two major airports and an increase in the number of gaming positions at each of the existing illinois casinos which are currently limited to  positions 
the measure would have also reduced the top gaming tax rate on adjusted gross receipts from to 
the measure was not passed by the illinois house before the legislative session ended  however  it is possible this or a similar measure will be introduced in the current legislative session 
if illinois materially expands gaming  particularly in downtown chicago or the south chicago suburbs  the additional competition could materially adversely affect the financial performance of ameristar east chicago 
a state senator has again introduced a measure in the indiana legislature that would allow one of the two adjacent riverboat casino licenses held by the same operator in gary  indiana  approximately five miles from ameristar east chicago  to be moved to a nearby land based location 
if the casino is allowed to relocate inland  ameristar east chicago would face significant additional competition that would adversely affect its financial performance 
in december  a competitor opened a new casino in downtown st 
louis  approximately miles from ameristar st 
charles  and in march the same competitor opened an additional casino facility in southeastern st 
louis county  approximately miles from ameristar st 
charles 
the new facilities have resulted in significant additional competition for ameristar st 
charles that has adversely impacted ameristar st 
charles business 
in addition  if legislation is enacted in illinois to permit the operation of slot machines at racetracks  ameristar st 
charles would face additional competition from the racetrack near east st 
louis  illinois 
the missouri state lottery authority is considering introducing video lottery terminals vlts at the state s existing lottery outlets in order to help make up a shortfall in the state budget 
vlts are very similar in appearance and performance to casino slot machines 
if this occurs  the vlts would represent additional competition for our st 
charles and kansas city properties 
native american gaming facilities in some instances operate under regulatory and financial requirements that are less stringent than those imposed on state licensed casinos  which could provide them with a competitive advantage and lead to increased competition in our markets 
in december  the national indian gaming commission the nigc approved the request of the ponca tribe of nebraska to have a five acre parcel owned by the tribe in carter lake  iowa  located approximately five miles from ameristar council bluffs  approved for the operation of gaming 
in december  in a lawsuit brought by the state of nebraska and joined by the state of iowa and the city of council bluffs  the federal district court reversed the nigc s decision 
the us department of the interior appealed the district court ruling  and in october the eighth circuit court of appeals reversed the district court s decision and ordered the court to remand the matter to the nigc for further consideration 
the court of appeals directed the nigc to revisit the issue  taking into consideration  among other things  a agreement between the state of iowa and the bureau of indian affairs 
that agreement stated that the five acre parcel would be utilized for a health center and not for gaming purposes 
if the tribe is allowed to conduct gaming at this location  the additional competition would adversely affect our council bluffs business 
the entry into our current markets of additional competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations  particularly if a competitor were to obtain a license to operate a gaming facility in a superior location 
furthermore  increases in the popularity of  and competition from  internet and other account wagering and gaming services  which allow customers to wager on a wide variety of sporting events and play las vegas style casino games from home  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results and prospects 
our business may be adversely affected by legislation prohibiting tobacco smoking 
legislation in various forms to ban indoor tobacco smoking in public places has recently been enacted or introduced in many states and local jurisdictions  including several of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
effective january   a colorado smoking ban was extended to include casino floors 
we believe this ban has significantly negatively impacted business volumes in all colorado gaming markets 
in april  voters in the 
table of contents city of kansas city approved a ballot measure  which was subsequently modified by the city council  that prohibits smoking in most indoor public places within the city  including restaurants  but which contains an exemption for casino floors and of all hotel rooms 
two of ameristar kansas city s competitors are not subject to a smoking ban in any form  which we believe has had some negative impact on our business 
on july   a statewide indoor smoking ban went into effect in the state of iowa 
the law includes an exemption for casino floors and of all hotel rooms 
a bill is pending in the iowa general assembly that would eliminate the casino floor exemption 
nevada has a statewide indoor smoking ban  with exemptions for the gaming areas of casinos and bars where prepared food is not served 
in january  a statewide indoor smoking ban was passed by the indiana house  and the governor has stated he will sign the measure if it is passed by the full legislature 
similar bills have been introduced from time to time in the missouri general assembly  and some members of the st 
charles county council have recently stated they favor a public referendum on a county wide indoor smoking ban that would not exempt the casino floor of ameristar st

if additional restrictions on smoking are enacted in jurisdictions in which we operate  particularly if such restrictions are applicable to casino floors  our business could be materially adversely affected 
if the jurisdictions in which we operate increase gaming taxes and fees  our results could be adversely affected 
state and local authorities raise a significant amount of revenue through taxes and fees on gaming activities 
from time to time  legislators and government officials have proposed changes in tax laws  or in the administration of such laws  affecting the gaming industry 
periods of economic downturn and budget deficits  such as are currently being experienced in most states  may intensify such efforts to raise revenues through increases in gaming taxes 
if the jurisdictions in which we operate were to increase gaming taxes or fees  depending on the magnitude of the increase and any offsetting factors such as the elimination of the buy in limit in missouri that became effective in  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
currently  the governor of iowa is proposing that the legislature increase the gaming tax rate paid by riverboat casinos on adjusted gross receipts from to and reduce the state s business earnings taxes 
if enacted  a gaming tax increase of this magnitude would materially adversely affect the results of operations of ameristar council bluffs and the other casinos in the state 
we are subject to the risk of rising interest rates 
our outstanding debt under our senior credit facilities bears interest at variable rates 
as of december   we had million outstanding under our senior credit facilities 
if we obtain new financing as we contemplate  our variable interest rate debt may increase substantially 
if short term interest rates rise from current levels  our interest cost would increase  which would adversely affect our net income and available cash 
our business is subject to restrictions and limitations imposed by gaming regulatory authorities that could adversely affect us 
the ownership and operation of casino gaming facilities are subject to extensive state and local regulation 
the states of missouri  iowa  indiana  mississippi  colorado and nevada and the applicable local authorities require various licenses  findings of suitability  registrations  permits and approvals to be held by us and our subsidiaries 
the missouri gaming commission  the iowa racing and gaming commission  the indiana gaming commission  the mississippi gaming commission  the colorado limited gaming control commission and the nevada gaming commission may  among other things  limit  condition  suspend  revoke or not renew a license or approval to own the stock of any of our missouri  iowa  indiana  mississippi  colorado or nevada subsidiaries  respectively  for any cause deemed reasonable by such licensing authority 
our gaming licenses in missouri and colorado must be renewed every two years  our gaming licenses in iowa and indiana must be renewed every year  and our gaming license in mississippi must be renewed every three years 
if we violate gaming laws or regulations  substantial fines could be levied against us  our subsidiaries and the persons involved  and we could be forced to forfeit portions of our assets 
the suspension  revocation or non renewal of any of our licenses or the levy on us of substantial fines or forfeiture of assets could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents to date  we have obtained all governmental licenses  findings of suitability  registrations  permits and approvals necessary for the operation of our currently operating gaming activities 
however  gaming licenses and related approvals are deemed to be privileges under the laws of all the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we cannot assure you that our existing licenses  permits and approvals will be maintained or extended 
we also cannot assure you that any new licenses  permits and approvals that may be required in the future will be granted to us 
holders of our common stock may be subject to gaming regulatory requirements or could be forced to sell their shares 
all of the jurisdictions in which we operate gaming facilities have regulations requiring owners of more than a specified percentage of our outstanding stock to notify gaming regulatory authorities  provide information or certifications to those authorities and  in some cases  apply for a finding of suitability or license 
the threshold level of ownership for such requirements in some jurisdictions is as low as of our outstanding common stock  although exceptions or reduced requirements may be applicable for timely submissions by holders who generally qualify as institutional investors as defined in that jurisdiction and own not more than of our stock 
the specific qualifications vary by jurisdiction  but the lack of intent to exercise control over the company or its operations  by itself  is not a sufficient basis for exception or reduced requirements in some jurisdictions 
for more information  see item business government regulation 
upon consummation of the repurchase transaction  the percentage ownership of each existing stockholder will increase without any change in the number of shares owned by such holder 
therefore  owners of more than approximately of our outstanding common stock immediately prior to the repurchase transaction who are not already subject to these requirements will be required to make regulatory submissions promptly after the consummation of the repurchase transaction  and owners of more than approximately of our stock immediately prior to the transaction could face significantly increased regulatory burdens 
owners of sufficient percentages of our common stock who do not or cannot comply with these requirements may be compelled to dispose of their common stock quickly and at a time at which they do not desire to do so 
any such sales by a significant holder of common stock  and the regulatory disincentives to acquire significant ownership positions  could affect the trading price of our common stock 
adverse weather conditions or natural disasters in the areas in which we operate  or other conditions that restrict access to our properties  could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
adverse weather conditions  particularly flooding  heavy snowfall and other extreme conditions  as well as natural disasters  can deter our guests from traveling or make it difficult for them to visit our properties 
if any of our properties were to experience prolonged adverse weather conditions  or if multiple properties were to simultaneously experience adverse weather conditions  our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected 
our business may also be adversely affected by other events or conditions that restrict access to our properties  such as road closures 
on december   the indiana department of transportation announced that it was permanently closing the cline avenue bridge near ameristar east chicago 
the bridge had been closed since november  due to safety concerns discovered during an inspection of the bridge 
closure of the bridge has made access to the property inconvenient for many of ameristar east chicago s customers and has significantly impacted the property s business levels and operating results  and we expect this to continue unless and until improved access is developed 
as a result of the bridge closure  access to our property has significantly deteriorated relative to the access of our primary competitors 
in black hawk  a project to widen a mile long stretch of state route near ameristar black hawk to four lanes began in late and is expected to last until mid also  in the spring of a drainage pipe will be buried underneath the portion of route that runs through the center of black hawk  directly in front of our property 
the details of that project have not yet been finalized 
these projects are expected to create some inconvenience for guests of ameristar black hawk and adversely affect its business levels while they are ongoing 

table of contents the missouri department of transportation has announced it will be undertaking a major renovation of the westbound span of the blanchette bridge  which carries interstate over the missouri river near ameristar st 
charles 
the project is expected to begin in early and last approximately one year 
during the project  the westbound span of the bridge will be closed and westbound traffic will be diverted to the eastbound span  which will carry three lanes in each direction  compared to the current five lanes in each direction 
the project will create inconvenience for guests of ameristar st 
charles that we expect will materially adversely affect its business levels while it is ongoing 
we have limited insurance coverage for earthquake damage at our properties 
several of our properties  particularly ameristar st 
charles  are located near historically active earthquake faults 
in the event one of our properties were to sustain significant damage from an earthquake  our business could be materially adversely affected 
we have limited opportunities to develop new properties 
the casino gaming industry has limited new development opportunities 
most jurisdictions in which casino gaming is currently permitted place numerical and or geographical limitations on the issuance of new gaming licenses 
although a number of jurisdictions in the united states and foreign countries are considering legalizing or expanding casino gaming  in some cases new gaming operations may be restricted to specific locations  such as pari mutuel racetracks 
moreover  it is not clear whether the tax  land use planning and regulatory structures that may be applicable to any new gaming opportunity would make the development and operation of a casino financially acceptable 
we expect that there will be intense competition for any attractive new opportunities that do arise  and many of the companies competing for such opportunities will have greater resources and name recognition than we do 
therefore  we cannot assure that we will be able to successfully expand our business through new development 
the estate of craig h 
neilsen currently owns a majority of our common stock and may have interests that differ from those of the other holders of our common stock 
craig h 
neilsen  our founder and former chairman of the board and chief executive officer  died in november at the time of his death  mr 
neilsen beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding common stock 
as a result of his death  these shares passed by operation of law to mr 
neilsen s estate 
the co executors of the estate are ray h 
neilsen  our chairman of the board  and gordon r 
kanofsky  our chief executive officer and vice chairman 
craig h 
neilsen s estate plan provides that  shares of our common stock owned by the estate or approximately of our shares currently outstanding will ultimately pass to the craig h 
neilsen foundation  a private foundation primarily focused on funding spinal cord injury research and treatment the foundation 
messrs 
neilsen and kanofsky serve as the co trustees of the foundation  and they also serve on the foundation s five person board of directors 
in light of their control over a majority of our common stock  messrs 
neilsen and kanofsky jointly have the ability to elect our entire board of directors over time and  except as otherwise provided by law or our articles of incorporation or bylaws  to approve or disapprove other matters that may be submitted to a vote of the stockholders 
some of the factors influencing the estate s investment decisions with respect to our common stock may not be relevant to other holders of our common stock 
if the repurchase transaction is consummated  the estate will own approximately of our outstanding common stock 
due to its liquidity needs  in order to diversify its investments or for other reasons  the estate or its beneficiaries  including the foundation  may sell additional shares of our stock in the market or otherwise  which could adversely affect the market price of the stock 
the continued payment of dividends on our stock is dependent on a number of factors and is not assured 
holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments 
the payment of future dividends will depend upon our earnings  economic conditions  liquidity and capital requirements and other factors  including the higher debt leverage and debt service requirements we will have if we consummate the refinancing 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that future dividends will be paid at levels comparable to our historical distributions  if at all 
in addition  
table of contents our senior credit facilities and the indenture governing our senior notes impose limitations on the amount of dividends we may pay  and we expect the terms of any new financing we obtain will impose limitations on our ability to pay dividends determined by one or more of the amount of dividends  the satisfaction of certain financial covenants or other conditions 
many factors  some of which are beyond our control  could adversely affect our ability to successfully complete our construction and development projects as planned 
general construction risks delays and cost overruns 
construction and expansion projects for our properties entail significant risks 
these risks include shortages of materials including slot machines or other gaming equipment  shortages of skilled labor or work stoppages  unforeseen construction scheduling  engineering  environmental or geological problems  weather interference  floods  hurricanes  fires or other casualty losses  unanticipated cost increases  delays or increased costs in obtaining required governmental permits and approvals  and construction period disruption to existing operations 
our anticipated costs and construction periods for construction projects are based upon budgets  conceptual design documents and construction schedule estimates prepared by us in consultation with our architects  consultants and contractors 
the cost of any construction project undertaken by us may vary significantly from initial expectations  and we may have a limited amount of capital resources to fund cost overruns on any project 
if we cannot finance cost overruns on a timely basis  the completion of one or more projects may be delayed until adequate cash flows from operations or other financing is available 
the completion date of any of our construction projects could also differ significantly from initial expectations for construction related or other reasons 
we cannot assure you that any project will be completed on time  if at all  or within established budgets 
significant delays or cost overruns on our construction projects could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are currently engaged in litigation with the general contractor for our st 
charles hotel project  which was completed later and at a higher cost than originally announced 
from time to time  we may employ fast track design and construction methods in our construction and development projects 
this involves the design of future stages of construction while earlier stages of construction are underway 
although we believe the use of fast track design and construction methods may reduce the overall construction time  these methods may not always result in such reductions  often involve greater construction costs than otherwise would be incurred and may increase the risk of disputes with contractors  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
construction dependent upon available financing and cash flows from operations 
the availability of funds under our senior credit facilities at any time are dependent upon  among other factors  the amount of our ebitda  as defined in the senior credit facilities  during the preceding four consecutive fiscal quarters 
our future operating performance will be subject to financial  economic  business  competitive  regulatory and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that our future consolidated ebitda and the resulting availability of operating cash flows or borrowing capacity will be sufficient to allow us to undertake or complete future construction projects 
as a result of operating risks  including those described in this section  and other risks associated with a new venture  we cannot assure you that  once completed  any development project will increase our operating profits or operating cash flows 
our business may be materially impacted by an act of terrorism or by additional security requirements that may be imposed on us 
the us department of homeland security has stated that places where large numbers of people congregate  including hotels  are subject to a heightened risk of terrorism 
an act of terrorism affecting one of our properties  whether or not covered by insurance  or otherwise affecting the gaming  travel or tourism industry in the united states  may have a material adverse effect on our business 
additionally  our business may become subject to increased security measures designed to prevent terrorist acts 

table of contents our business may be adversely affected by our ability to retain and attract key personnel 
we depend on the continued performance of our entire senior management team 
if we lose the services of any of our key executives or our senior property management personnel and cannot replace such persons in a timely manner  it could have an adverse effect on our business 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience strong competition in hiring and retaining qualified property and corporate management personnel  including competition from numerous native american gaming facilities that are not subject to the same taxation regimes as we are and therefore may be willing and able to pay higher rates of compensation 
from time to time  we have a number of vacancies in key corporate and property management positions 
if we are unable to successfully recruit and retain qualified management personnel at our properties or at our corporate level  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
as we recruit personnel  we expect successful candidates to exhibit a collaborative  communicative and collegial nature 
we also employ a high degree of centralization in a generally highly decentralized industry 
these factors create risk in attracting management personnel in a timely fashion  as well as hiring candidates we expect to be successful within our company 
the concentration and evolution of the slot machine manufacturing industry or other technological conditions could impose additional costs on us 
the majority of our revenues are attributable to slot machines operated by us at our casinos 
it is important  for competitive reasons  that we offer the most popular and up to date slot machine games with the latest technology to our guests 
in recent years  the prices of new slot machines have escalated faster than the rate of inflation 
furthermore  in recent years  slot machine manufacturers have frequently refused to sell slot machines featuring the most popular games  instead requiring participating lease arrangements in order to acquire the machines 
participation slot machine leasing arrangements typically require the payment of a fixed daily rental 
such agreements may also include a percentage payment of coin in or net win 
generally  a participating lease is substantially more expensive over the long term than the cost to purchase a new machine 
for competitive reasons  we may be forced to purchase new slot machines or enter into participating lease arrangements that are more expensive than the costs associated with the continued operation of our existing slot machines 
if the newer slot machines do not result in sufficient incremental revenues to offset the increased investment and participating lease costs  it could hurt our profitability 
we materially rely on a variety of hardware and software products to maximize revenue and efficiency in our operations 
technology in the gaming industry is developing rapidly  and we may need to invest substantial amounts to acquire the most current gaming and hotel technology and equipment in order to remain competitive in the markets in which we operate 
ensuring the successful implementation and maintenance of any new technology acquired is an additional risk 
any loss from service of our operating facilities for any reason could materially adversely affect us 
our operating facilities could be lost from service due to casualty  mechanical failure  extended or extraordinary maintenance  floods or other severe weather conditions 
our riverboat and barge facilities are especially exposed to these risks and the changes in water levels 
the ameristar vicksburg site has experienced ongoing geologic instability that requires periodic maintenance and improvements 
although we have reinforced the cofferdam basin in which the vessel is drydocked on a concrete foundation  further reinforcements may be necessary 
we are also monitoring the site and expect that further steps will be necessary to stabilize the site in order to permit operations to continue 
a site failure would require ameristar vicksburg to limit or cease operations 
the loss of an operating facility from service for any period of time likely would adversely affect our operating results and borrowing capacity under our senior credit facilities or any replacement facilities in an amount that we 
table of contents are unable to reasonably accurately estimate 
it could also result in the occurrence of an event of a default under our senior credit facilities or any replacement facilities 
a change in control could result in the acceleration of our debt obligations 
certain changes in control of ameristar could result in the acceleration of our senior credit facilities and the obligation to offer to repurchase our senior notes or any replacement credit facilities or notes that we obtain or issue in the refinancing 
we cannot assure that we would be able to repay or refinance any indebtedness that is accelerated as a result of a change in control  and this would likely materially adversely affect our financial condition 
these acceleration provisions arising from a change in control contained in our senior credit facilities and senior notes should not be implicated in connection with the contemplated repurchase transaction as a result of our planned contemporaneous refinancing of such obligations 
we are subject to non gaming regulation 
we are subject to certain federal  state and local environmental laws  regulations and ordinances that apply to non gaming businesses generally  including the clean air act  the clean water act  the resource conservation recovery act  the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act and the oil pollution act of under various federal  state and local laws and regulations  an owner or operator of real property may be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances or wastes located on its property  regardless of whether or not the present owner or operator knows of  or is responsible for  the presence of such substances or wastes 
we have not identified any issues associated with our properties that could reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on us or the results of our operations 
however  certain of our properties are located in industrial areas or were used for industrial purposes for many years 
as a consequence  it is possible that historical or neighboring activities have affected one or more of our properties and that  as a result  environmental issues could arise in the future  the precise nature of which we cannot now predict 
we do not have environmental liability insurance to cover most such events  and the environmental liability insurance coverage we maintain to cover certain events includes significant limitations and exclusions 
in addition  if we discover any significant environmental contamination affecting any of our properties  we could face material remediation costs or additional development costs for future expansion activities 
regulations adopted by the financial crimes enforcement network of the us treasury department require us to report currency transactions in excess of  occurring within a gaming day  including identification of the patron by name and social security number 
us treasury department regulations also require us to report certain suspicious activity  including any transaction that exceeds  if we know  suspect or have reason to believe that the transaction involves funds from illegal activity or is designed to evade federal regulations or reporting requirements 
substantial penalties can be imposed against us if we fail to comply with these regulations 
our riverboats must comply with certain federal and state laws and regulations with respect to boat design  on board facilities  equipment  personnel and safety 
in addition  we are required to have third parties periodically inspect and certify all of our casino barges for stability and single compartment flooding integrity 
our casino barges also must meet local fire safety standards 
we would incur additional costs if any of our gaming facilities were not in compliance with one or more of these regulations 
we are also subject to a variety of other federal  state and local laws and regulations  including those relating to zoning  construction  land use  employment  marketing and advertising and the sale of alcoholic beverages 
if we are not in compliance with these laws and regulations  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the imposition of a substantial penalty or the loss of service of a gaming facility for a significant period of time would have a material adverse effect on our business

item legal proceedings st 
charles hotel project construction litigation 
in november  acsci entered into a contract the contract with walton construction company  llc walton  pursuant to which walton was to provide general contracting and construction management services for the construction of the suite hotel and related amenities at ameristar st 
charles 
the contract provides for payment of the actual cost of the work subject to a guaranteed maximum price gmp 
the original contract completion date was november  and that date was extended to december  by written amendment in march while we were able to open the hotel facility in stages as it was being completed in the first half of in order to mitigate damages from the delay  the project was not substantially completed until june after the march amendment  walton asserted various claims for additional compensation  in excess of the agreed upon gmp  based on alleged changes to the contract scope of work and asserted delays and other impacts to the completion of the project 
we reviewed and rejected many of these claims  
table of contents but did accept others and issued appropriate change orders to walton 
the gmp  as agreed to by us  is slightly less than million 
on june   walton filed a mechanic s lien against the st 
charles property 
in addition  on that same day  walton filed suit in the circuit court of st 
charles county  missouri seeking recovery of the amounts included in its mechanic s lien 
walton also has sought interest on unpaid amounts pursuant to the missouri prompt pay act  which gives the judge discretion to award up to per month interest on amounts that are not paid pursuant to the terms of an enforceable contract and discretion to award attorneys fees to the prevailing party  if any  in the dispute 
walton s lawsuit and lien essentially claim that the gmp ought to be increased to approximately million  with the increase representing certain amounts allegedly due to subcontractors for work performed as well as amounts claimed by walton for its own management  supervision and general conditions 
since the filing of the lien and lawsuit  we have resolved the majority of the claims for subcontractor work directly with the affected subcontractors 
we expect that these efforts will result in our making a total contract expenditure inclusive of amounts previously paid to walton pursuant to the gmp and amounts paid directly to subcontractors of approximately million 
we believe that the additional amounts claimed by walton in its lawsuit approximately million primarily relate to the claims that walton has asserted for its own extended general conditions  added contingency and other costs for its own account 
all those claims remain disputed and contested by ameristar 
we have also filed a counterclaim against walton seeking damages in excess of million based on the delay in completion of the project and defective and deficient work by walton 
we are vigorously defending against walton s claims and have asserted our own claims 
the litigation continues in the discovery stage  including depositions 
in addition to walton s mechanic s lien  certain subcontractors to walton have filed mechanic s liens against the st 
charles property  and some also filed suit to foreclose on such liens 
our settlement of claims directly with subcontractors has resulted in the dismissal  with prejudice  of a number of these liens and lawsuits 
east chicago local development agreement litigation 
in  showboat casino marina partnership showboat  the original owner of our east chicago casino property  entered into a local development agreement the lda  agreeing to pay of its adjusted gross receipts agr for local economic development purposes 
the payments were to be made a to the city of east chicago the city  b each to two separate community non profit foundations  which subsequently merged with each other foundations  and c to east chicago second century  inc  a for profit indiana corporation formed by showboat to pursue local economic development second century 
in  showboat sold the property to an affiliate of harrah s entertainment  inc harrah s 
during the entire period that showboat and harrah s owned the property  they paid of their agr to these entities 
in april  rih acquisitions in  llc rih now known as ameristar casino east chicago  llc purchased the property from harrah s 
shortly before that time  the city began to assert a right to all of the lda funds 
in june  the indiana gaming commission the igc adopted a resolution disapproving of that portion of the lda requiring the casino licensee to make any payments to second century due to its concerns with the individuals owning and controlling second century  who were associates of the former mayor of the city 
the resolution directed rih to propose to the igc a plan of action for how rih would continue making the lda payments in light of the igc s decision disapproving of the payments to second century and the competing and irreconcilable claims of second century and the city to those funds 
to comply with the resolution  on june   rih filed a proposed plan of action with the igc 
among other things  rih proposed that it would pay the of agr payments earmarked for second century into a separate interest bearing bank account and hold those funds and the interest thereon in the account until a court of competent jurisdiction ordered otherwise 
the igc did not take further action on the plan of action  and on june   rih started making these payments to the separate account 
after we acquired rih on september   in accordance with the purchase agreement  rih opened a new separate interest bearing bank account under our federal tax identification number and transferred the entire balance in the former separate account to this new account 
rih has continued to deposit of its agr into this account 
as of february   this account had a balance of approximately million 

table of contents in april  the indiana legislature enacted a bill  which was signed into law by the governor  permitting the common council of the city  upon transfer of the controlling interest in the east chicago casino license  to adopt an ordinance voiding any term of the lda and allowing for any payment of funds under the lda to be redirected to the city 
the common council of the city adopted an ordinance in october voiding those terms of the lda that provide for payment of lda funds to second century and adopted a similar ordinance that applies to the funds formerly paid to foundations 
these ordinances purport to redirect the payment of all lda funds to the city  including the funds held by rih in the separate bank account 
on june   prior to the closing of our acquisition of rih  second century filed a complaint against aci and rih in superior court of marion county  indiana 
the complaint alleges that rih s action to stop making lda payments to second century and instead make the payments to the separate bank account was a breach of the lda  conversion  criminal conversion and constructive fraud 
second century is seeking to recover an amount equal to the of agr payments it claims should have been made to it since june   compensatory damages  treble damages under indiana s crime victims statute and its attorneys fees  and is also seeking a declaration from the court that aci is now bound by the lda and is required to pay of rih s agr to second century 
in december  the court issued an order requiring rih to continue paying the of agr payments to the separate bank account and to hold all the funds in that account until it or another court of competent jurisdiction orders otherwise 
second century moved for partial summary judgment against rih  seeking rulings that rih is in breach of the lda and that its failure to pay the lda funds to second century amounts to criminal conversion which would entitle second century to treble damages and its attorneys fees 
in january  aci and rih filed a response opposing the motion for summary judgment and seeking summary judgment in favor of rih on both the contract and conversion claims 
the city also filed a brief in opposition to second century s motion for partial summary judgment 
on september   the court issued an amended order granting summary judgment in favor of aci and rih and denying summary judgment in favor of second century on second century s conversion claim 
the court denied each party s motion for summary judgment on second century s breach of contract claim 
the court entered a final judgment on the conversion claim on october  second century filed a motion to reconsider the court s order directing entry of final judgment  which the court denied on january  second century did not appeal the final judgment granting aci and rih summary judgment on the criminal conversion claim 
in  foundations filed suit challenging the constitutionality of the legislation and the city s ordinance adopted under that legislation 
rih intervened in the case  and in december the trial court ordered rih to establish an interest bearing account and deposit in that account the funds in dispute in foundations case challenging the constitutionality of the legislation and city ordinance 
as of february   this separate account had a balance of approximately million 
on june   the indiana supreme court issued an opinion in one of multiple appeals related to the east chicago riverboat casino license 
the court held that the igc has the authority to revoke or cancel the licenses and their attendant conditions 
the court further held that the city does not have the authority unilaterally to terminate or alter the terms and conditions of a license issued by the gaming commission 
in  the indiana supreme court issued an opinion in foundations constitutional challenge lawsuit  holding that the legislation does not by its terms even purport to alter the commission s regulatory authority 
the indiana supreme court did not determine whether foundations was entitled to receive funds under the gaming license  but instead determined that whether 
foundations 
is entitled to receive funds under the gaming license 


is first and foremost a matter of administrative law for the indiana gaming commission to decide 
we have not taken a position on the merits of the other parties disputes over the lda funds  and have stated that we are committed to continue paying the of agr for local economic development purposes unless a court of competent jurisdiction orders otherwise 
we intend to comply with the two trial court orders requiring rih to hold and continuing paying the lda funds formerly paid to second century and foundations in the respective designated separate bank accounts  and we intend to vigorously contest any claims against us seeking money beyond our stated commitment to pay of rih s agr for local economic development purposes

our financial results are dependent upon the number of patrons that we attract to our properties and the amounts those patrons spend per visit 
additionally  our operating results may be affected by  among other things  overall economic conditions affecting the disposable income of our patrons  our gaming hold percentages  weather conditions affecting our properties  achieving and maintaining cost efficiencies  competitive factors  gaming tax increases and other regulatory changes  the commencement of new gaming operations  charges associated with debt refinancing or property acquisition and disposition transactions  construction at existing facilities and general public sentiment regarding travel 
we may experience significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results due to seasonality and other factors 
historically  our fourth quarter is weaker than other periods due mostly to the combined effects of inclement weather and guest visitation and spending patterns between the thanksgiving and christmas holidays 
consequently  our operating results for any quarter or year are not necessarily comparable and may not be indicative of future periods results 
the following significant factors and trends should be considered in analyzing our operating performance general economic conditions 
the weak economic conditions continue to adversely impact the gaming industry and our company 
we believe our guests have reduced their discretionary spending as a result of uncertainty and instability relating to employment and the credit and housing markets 

table of contents cost efficiencies 
in july  we began to implement a strategic plan to improve efficiencies and reduce our cost structure as weak economic conditions continued to adversely impact business volumes 
as part of this plan  we reduced our workforce costs through position eliminations  adjusting staffing practices and attrition 
we also restructured the organization of our property and corporate management teams to be more efficient and streamlined 
ameristar black hawk 
in july  positive statewide regulatory changes became effective in black hawk 
the regulatory changes extended casino operating hours from hours daily to hours daily  increased the maximum single bet limit from to up to and allowed for additional table games  including roulette and craps 
also  in september  we opened a room luxury hotel and spa featuring upscale furnishings and amenities 
the hotel includes a versatile meeting and ballroom center and has black hawk s only full service spa and an enclosed rooftop swimming pool with indoor outdoor whirlpool facilities 
ameristar black hawk offers destination resort amenities and services that we believe are unequaled in the denver gaming market 
as a result of these regulatory changes and the opening of the new hotel  net revenues and operating income increased year over year in by and  respectively  compared to the property also increased its annual market share on a year over year basis from to 
east chicago bridge closure and intangible asset impairment 
in  we recorded a total of million million on an after tax basis in non cash impairment charges for the goodwill and gaming license related to our september east chicago property acquisition 
the reduction in the value of these intangible assets was attributable to the significant deterioration of the debt and equity capital markets  as well as a lowering of our growth assumptions for the property to reflect its then current operating performance relative to our assumptions at the time of acquisition and the decline in general economic conditions 
during the fourth quarter of  the highway bridge near our ameristar east chicago property was permanently closed by the indiana department of transportation due to safety concerns 
the bridge closure has made access to the property inconvenient for many of our guests and has significantly impacted the property s admissions levels and operating results 
the adverse business impact is expected to continue unless and until improved access to the property is developed 
as a result  in the fourth quarter of  we recorded an additional non cash impairment charge of million million on an after tax basis for the impairment of goodwill related to our east chicago property acquisition 
during the second quarter of  we recorded another non cash charge of million million on an after tax basis for the impairment of goodwill and the gaming license 
the bridge closure continues to impact our business  resulting in a year over year decrease in net revenues of million  or  as compared to missouri properties 
in late  positive regulatory reform was implemented in missouri benefitting our kansas city and st 
charles properties 
the regulatory reform eliminated the buy in limit and the requirement for all casino guests to use player identification and tracking cards 
additionally  the missouri gaming reform raised taxes on gross gaming receipts from to and placed a moratorium on the issuance of additional gaming licenses 
in early march  a gaming operator opened a new casino facility located in the southeastern portion of st 
louis county  approximately miles from our st 
charles property 
the additional competition has adversely affected the financial performance of ameristar st 
charles and the other facilities that operate in the market

we used the net proceeds from the sale of the notes approximately million  after deducting discounts and expenses to repay a portion of the revolving loan indebtedness outstanding under the senior credit facility 
our interest expense has increased significantly as a result of the senior credit facility amendment  notes issuance and extension of our revolving loan facility that all took place in in  consolidated net interest expense increased by million  or  compared to  primarily due to these debt restructuring transactions and lower capitalized interest 
capitalized interest decreased from million in to million in  primarily due to the completion of the ameristar black hawk hotel 
consolidated net interest expense for the last half of decreased when compared to the same period in by million  or  due to the expiration of our two interest rate swap agreements on july

historically  we have funded our daily operations through net cash provided by operating activities and our significant capital expenditures primarily through operating cash flows  bank debt and other debt financing

we do not have any other guarantees  contingent commitments or other material liabilities that are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements or disclosed in the notes  thereto 
for more information  see note long term debt of notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements 
to prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
we regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions  particularly in areas we consider to be critical accounting estimates  where changes in the estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position and  generally to a lesser extent  cash flows 
senior management and the audit committee of our board of directors have reviewed the disclosures included herein about our critical accounting estimates  and have reviewed the processes to determine those estimates 
property and equipment we have significant capital invested in our property and equipment  which represents approximately of our total assets 
judgments are made in determining the estimated useful lives of assets  salvage values to be assigned to assets and if or when an asset has been impaired 
the accuracy of these estimates affects the amount of depreciation expense recognized in our financial results and the extent to which we have a gain or loss on the disposal of the asset 
we assign lives to our assets based on our standard policy  which we believe is representative of the useful life of each category of assets 
we review the carrying value of our property and equipment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
the factors we consider in performing this assessment include current operating results  trends and prospects  as well as the effect of obsolescence  demand  competition and other economic factors 
goodwill and other intangible assets at december   after recording the impairment charge at ameristar east chicago described below  we had approximately million in goodwill and million in other intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet resulting from the acquisition of ameristar east chicago in september and our two missouri properties in december as required under asc  we perform an annual assessment of our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets to determine if the carrying value exceeded the fair value 
additionally  asc requires an immediate impairment assessment if a change in circumstances occurs that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
we perform impairment reviews under a two step method 
under the first step  we are required to estimate the fair value of reporting units to determine if any implied impairment exists 
we utilize both the market approach and the income approach present value techniques in the determination of fair value 
under the market approach  the value of invested capital is derived through industry multiples and other assumptions 
the income approach requires fair value to be measured through the present value of future cash flows expected to be generated by the reporting unit 
taking into account both the income and market approach fair value estimates  during the impairment review we performed in the second quarter of  we determined that the carrying value of ameristar east chicago exceeded the fair value and we were required to perform the second step of the impairment test 
in step two of the impairment test  we determined the implied value of goodwill by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit determined in step one to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit  as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination 
the implied fair value of the ameristar east chicago goodwill and gaming license was less than the carrying value and the excess was recorded as an impairment charge 
the goodwill of our missouri properties was also tested for impairment 
the assessment did not result in any impairment charges for these assets 
guest rewards programs our guest rewards programs allow guests to earn certain point based cash rewards or complimentary goods and services based on the volume of the guests gaming activity 
guests can accumulate reward points over time that 
table of contents they may redeem at their discretion under the terms of the programs 
the reward credit balance is forfeited if a guest does not earn any reward credits over any subsequent month period 
as a result of the ability of the guest to bank the reward points  we accrue the expense of reward points  after giving effect to estimated forfeitures  as they are earned 
the accruals are based on historical data  estimates and assumptions regarding the mix of rewards that will be redeemed and the costs of providing those rewards 
the retail value of the point based cash rewards or complimentary goods and services is netted against revenue as a promotional allowance 
at december  and  the outstanding guest reward point liability was million and million  respectively 
cash  hotel and food coupons our former  current and future gaming guests may be awarded  on a discretionary basis  cash  hotel and food coupons based  in part  on their play volume 
the coupons are provided on a discretionary basis to induce future play and are redeemable within a short time period generally seven days for cash coupons and one month for hotel and food coupons 
there is no ability to renew or extend the offer 
we recognize a reduction in revenue as a promotional allowance for these coupons when the coupons are redeemed 
self insurance reserves we are self insured for various levels of general liability  workers compensation and employee health coverage 
insurance claims and reserves include accruals of estimated settlements for known claims  as well as accrued estimates of incurred but not reported claims 
at december  and  our estimated liabilities for unpaid and incurred but not reported claims totaled million and million  respectively 
we consider historical loss experience and certain unusual claims in estimating these liabilities 
we believe the use of this method to account for these liabilities provides a consistent and effective way to measure these highly judgmental accruals  however  changes in health care costs  accident or illness frequency and severity and other factors can materially affect the estimates for these liabilities 
in  the company entered into a trust participation agreement with an insurance provider 
the company currently has million deposited in a trust account as collateral for the company s obligation to reimburse the insurance provider for the self retained portion of our workers compensation claims 
accounting for share based compensation all share based payments to employees are recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values on the grant date 
we recognize those costs in the financial statements over the vesting period during which the employee provides services in exchange for the award 
these fair values are calculated by using the black scholes merton pricing formula  which requires estimates for expected volatility  expected dividends  the risk free interest rate and the expected term of the equity grant 
we are required to include an estimate of the number of awards that will be forfeited and update that number based on actual forfeitures 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded stock based compensation expense of million  million and million  respectively  as a component of selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
as of december   there was approximately million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share based compensation arrangements granted under the company s stock incentive plans 
this unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
income taxes our income tax returns are subject to examination by the internal revenue service irs and other tax authorities in the locations where we operate 
we assess potentially unfavorable outcomes of such examinations based on the criteria of asc  which prescribes a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
the guidance utilizes a two step approach for evaluating tax positions 
recognition step i occurs when we conclude that a tax position  based on its technical merits  is more likely than not ie  the likelihood of occurrence is greater than to be sustained upon examination 
measurement step ii is only addressed if the position is deemed to be more likely than not to be sustained 
under 
table of contents step ii  the tax benefit is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement 
the tax positions failing to qualify for initial recognition are to be recognized in the first subsequent interim period that they meet the more likely than not standard 
if it is subsequently determined that a previously recognized tax position no longer meets the more likely than not standard  it is required that the tax position be derecognized 
as applicable  we recognize accrued penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes 
litigation  claims and assessments we utilize estimates for litigation  claims and assessments related to our business and tax matters 
these estimates are in accordance with accounting standards regarding contingencies and are based upon our knowledge and experience about past and current events  as well as upon reasonable assumptions about future events 
actual results could differ from these estimates

the guidance clarifies that an entity should not accrue jackpot liabilities or portions thereof before a jackpot is won if the entity can avoid paying that jackpot since the machine can legally be removed from the gaming floor without payment of the base amount 
jackpots should be accrued and charged to revenue when an entity has the obligation to pay the jackpot 
this guidance applies to both base jackpots and the incremental portion of progressive jackpots 
the guidance is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  this guidance should be applied by recording a cumulative effect adjustment to opening retained earnings in the period of adoption 
as a result of implementing this change  we recorded an increase of million to retained earnings in january item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our senior credit facility 
outstanding amounts borrowed under our senior credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to libor in the case of eurodollar loans or the prime interest rate in the case of base rate loans  plus an applicable margin  or add on 
as of december   we had million outstanding under our senior credit facility  bearing interest at variable rates indexed to three month libor 
at december   the average interest rate applicable to the senior credit facility debt outstanding was 
an increase of one percentage point in the average interest rate applicable to the senior credit facility debt outstanding at december  would increase our annual interest cost by million 
on july   our two interest rate swap agreements expired 
see note derivative instruments and hedging activities of notes to consolidated financial statements for more discussion of the interest rate swaps 
we may enter into additional swap transactions or other interest rate protection agreements from time to time in the future 
however  the may refinancing of a substantial portion of our variable rate debt with the fixed rate senior unsecured notes reduces our exposure to interest rate risk and  if we obtain new financing  we anticipate that a significant portion of the new financing would consist of fixed rate notes 
accordingly  we have determined not to renew the use of interest rate swaps in the near term 
should we elect to use derivative instruments to hedge exposure to changes in the interest rates in the future  we again would be exposed to the potential failure of our counterparties to perform under the terms of the agreements 
we would minimize this risk by entering into interest rate swap agreements with highly rated commercial banks
