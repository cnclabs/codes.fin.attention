item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto located elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a leader in the design  development  marketing and promotion of innovative solutions in women s healthcare 
our flagship product is the proprietary essure permanent birth control system  which is the most effective non surgical permanent birth control system available 
the essure system delivers a soft and flexible insert into a woman s fallopian tubes  causing a benign tissue in growth which blocks the fallopian tubes 
successfully placed essure micro inserts and the subsequent tissue growth around and through the micro inserts prohibits the egg from traveling through the fallopian tube  preventing conception 
the effectiveness rate of the essure procedure determined in our clinical study is after four years of follow up 
we obtained approval to market essure in the european union in february and obtained the us food and drug administration  or fda  approval for essure in november nearly  women worldwide have undergone the essure procedure and we sold the essure system in countries in we sell essure directly in france through our wholly owned subsidiary  conceptus sas sas  as well as indirectly through a network of distributors throughout the rest of europe 
our wholly owned subsidiary in the united kingdom  conceptus medical limited cml  serves as our direct sales office in the united kingdom 
in we received a positive review from the national institute for health and clinical excellence in the united kingdom and an approval for the essure procedure from the brazilian national health service 
during the first quarter of we began to promote gynecare thermachoice uterine balloon therapy system in us ob gyn physician offices 
gynecare thermachoice is a global endometrial ablation product that is used to treat excessive uterine bleeding menorrhagia 
the product is manufactured for and marketed by ethicon women s health urology  a division of ethicon  inc net sales information based on segments and geographic regions is provided in note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting estimates and policies we follow accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap  in preparing our financial statements 
as part of this work  we must make many estimates and judgments about future events 
these affect the value of the assets and liabilities  contingent assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses reported in our financial statements 
we believe these estimates and judgments are reasonable and we make them in accordance with policies based on information available at the time 
however  actual results could differ from our estimates and could require us to record adjustments to expenses or revenues material to our financial position and results of operations in future periods 
we believe our most critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments include the following revenue recognition  stock based compensation  allowance for doubtful accounts  income taxes  cash  cash equivalents  and investments  warranty  
table of contents impairment of long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets  debt  and contingent liabilities 
revenue recognition our revenue is primarily comprised of the sale of our essure system 
we recognize revenue in accordance with accounting standards codification asc asc revenue recognition 
under this standard  the following four criteria must be met in order to recognize revenue persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  our selling price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
the four revenue recognition criteria are applied to our sales as described in the following paragraphs 
we recognize revenues from our essure system when title to the product and the risk of loss transfers to an external customer 
we do not accept returns of the essure system 
we obtain written authorizations from our customers for a specified amount of product at a specified price and the price is not dependent on actual essure procedures performed 
for sales through distributors we recognize revenues from our essure system when title to the product and the risk of loss transfers to the distributor 
our distributors are responsible for all marketing  sales  training and warranty for the essure system in their respective territories 
our standard terms and conditions do not provide price protection or stock rotation rights to any of our distributors 
in addition  our distributor agreements do not allow the distributor to return or exchange the essure system and the distributor is obligated to pay us for the sale regardless of their ability to resell the product 
additionally  we require physicians to be preceptored between and cases by a certified trainer before being able to perform the procedure independently 
there are no revenues associated with the training activities 
we do not charge a fee for the activity and no commitment arises for the physician from the preceptorship 
physician training is provided upfront and we have no obligation subsequent to the initial training 
training obligations have not been significant from inception to date 
we assess the credit worthiness of all customers in connection with their purchases 
we only recognize revenue when collectability is reasonably assured 
certain sales of our essure system may include delivery of additional items 
these obligations may be fulfilled after shipment of the essure system  and in these cases  we recognize revenue in accordance with the multiple element accounting guidance set forth in asc revenue multiple element arrangements 
when we have objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered elements we defer revenue attributable to the post shipment obligations and recognize such revenue when the obligation is fulfilled 
otherwise we defer all revenue until all elements are delivered 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the provisions of asc compensation stock compensation asc  using the modified prospective transition method 
accordingly  stock based compensation cost is measured on the grant date  based on the fair value of the award which is computed using the black scholes 
table of contents option valuation model  and is recognized as expense over the employee requisite service period 
we previously applied accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations and provided the required pro forma disclosures of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model with the weighted average assumptions shown in note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the black scholes option valuation model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the stock based award and the stock price volatility 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based compensation represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment 
as a result  if other assumptions had been used  our stock based compensation expense could have been materially different 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the share based compensation expense could be materially different 
the expected term of the options granted is derived from historical data on employee exercise and post vesting employment termination behavior 
the risk free interest rate for periods equal to the estimated life of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
expected volatility is based on historical volatility of our stock 
allowance for doubtful accounts we assess the credit worthiness of our customers on an ongoing basis in order to mitigate the risk of loss from customers not paying us 
however  we account for the possibility that certain customers may not pay us by maintaining an allowance for doubtful accounts 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain our allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
our exposure to credit losses may change as we increase our receivables 
changes in customer type and mix  as well as domestic and international economic climate  will also impact potential credit losses 
despite the significant amount of analysis used to compute the required allowance  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of our ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
in addition  our increase in sales may result in a higher accounts receivable balance  which may require a higher balance in the allowance 
as of december  and  our allowance for doubtful accounts totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
income taxes in preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
as of december   we had total net deferred tax assets of million consisting primarily of favorable temporary differences and net operating loss carryforwards 
in the fourth quarter of  we released our valuation allowance associated with our us federal deferred tax assets and a portion of our state deferred tax assets which resulted in an income tax benefit of million in our results of operations for this period 

table of contents we believe that our us operations had achieved a sufficient level of profitability and will sustain a sufficient level of profitability in and beyond to support the release of the valuation allowance based on current facts and circumstances 
however  if our assumptions on the future performance for our us operations prove to be incorrect and we are not able to sustain a sufficient level of profitability to support the associated deferred tax assets on our balance sheet  we will have to impair our deferred tax assets through an additional valuation allowance  which would impact our financial position and results of operations in the period such a determination is made 
our remaining valuation allowance as of december  relates to california net operating loss carryforwards that are projected to expire prior to utilization 
if we release our remaining valuation allowance  it will have an impact to our financial position and results of operations in the periods such determination is made 
we will continue to assess the need for our valuation allowances in the future 
cash  cash equivalents  and investments we consider all highly liquid investments with maturity from date of purchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents 
we maintain deposits with four financial institutions and invest our excess cash primarily in money market funds  commercial paper  corporate notes  time deposits  us treasury bills  us government bonds and corporate bonds which bear minimal risk 
our cash and cash equivalents in our operating and investment accounts are with third party financial institutions 
at times  these balances exceed the federal deposit insurance corporation insurance limits 
while we monitor the cash balances in our operating and investment accounts and adjust the cash balances as appropriate  these cash balances could be impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail or are subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets 
to date we have experienced no loss or lack of access to cash in our operating and investment accounts 
during  our investments included auction rate securities ars which were short term debt instruments backed by student loans  a substantial portion of which were guaranteed by the united states government 
prior to  our ars were highly liquid  using a dutch auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined intervals  typically every days  to provide liquidity at par 
we had experienced failed auctions since on most of our ars 
the failures of these auctions did not affect the value of the collateral underlying the ars  and we continued to earn and receive interest on our ars at a pre determined formula with spreads tied to particular interest rate indexes 
in november  we accepted an offer from ubs ag  providing us with rights related to our ars the rights 
the rights permitted us to require ubs to purchase our ars at par value  which is defined as the price equal to the liquidation preference of the ars plus accrued but unpaid dividends or interest  at any time during the period of july through july conversely  ubs had the right  in its discretion  to purchase or sell our ars at any time until july  so long as we received payment at par value upon any sale or disposition 
so long as we held our ars  they continued to accrue interest as determined by the auction process or the terms of the ars if the auction process failed 
prior to accepting the ubs offer  we recorded our ars as available for sale investments 
we recorded unrealized gains and losses on our available for sale securities in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the stockholders equity section of our balance sheets 
such unrealized gains and losses did not change net income loss for the applicable accounting period 
in connection with obtaining the put option  we transferred our ars from available for sale to trading securities in accordance with asc investments debt and equity securities 
the transfer to trading securities reflected our intent to exercise our put option during the third quarter of prior to our agreement with ubs  our intent was to hold our ars until we realized the par value 
in july  we exercised our put option to require ubs to repurchase our outstanding ars at full par value 
accordingly  we had redemptions of our ars in of million 
in addition  we recorded a gain in of million  which represented the increase in the fair value of the ars 
as of december   we no longer hold these types of investments 

table of contents we have accounted for the rights as a freestanding financial instrument and elected to record the value of the rights under the fair value option of asc financial instruments 
as a result of our election to record the rights at fair value  unrealized gains and losses have been included in earnings 
we estimated the fair value of the rights using the expected value that we would receive from ubs which was calculated as the difference between the anticipated recognized loss and par value of the ars as of the option exercise date 
this value was discounted by using a ubs credit default rate to account for the consideration of ubs credit risk 
in  we recorded an additional loss of million  which represents the decrease in the fair value of the put option 
due to the exercise of the put option in july and the resulting redemption of the ars the balance of rights as of december  is zero 
as of december  we had short and long term investments of million recorded at fair value 
our investments consist of time deposits  us treasury bills  us government bonds  commercial paper and corporate bonds 
we will sell certain or all investments as needed to meet the cash flow needs of our business 
hence our investments are classified as available for sale securities in accordance with asc investments debt and equity securities 
investments are classified as short term or long term based on the underlying investments maturity date 
see note investments in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
warranty we provide for the estimated cost of our product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
we record a liability for the estimated future costs associated with warranty claims  which is based upon historical experiences and our estimate of the level of future costs 
warranty costs are reflected in the statement of operations as a cost of goods sold 
we expect that warranty expense will increase as and if we increase our net sales 
warranty reserve rates may change if we change the manufacturing process or change our third party manufacturing contractors 
should actual costs differ from historical experience  increases in warranty expense may be required 
warranty reserves as of december  and were approximately million 
impairment of long lived assets we account for the impairment of long lived assets in accordance with asc property  plant and equipment 
we evaluate the carrying value of our long lived assets  consisting primarily of our property and equipment  the patents acquired in connection with our purchase of the intellectual property assets of ovion inc in  and intangible assets acquired in connection with our acquisition of sas in  whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
see note goodwill and intangible assets in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
such events or circumstances include a prolonged industry downturn  a significant decline in our market value or significant reductions in projected future cash flows 
significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows  including profit margins  long term forecasts of the amounts and timing of overall market growth and our percentage of that market  groupings of assets  discount rates and terminal growth rates 
in addition  significant estimates and assumptions are required in the determination of the fair value of our tangible long lived assets  including replacement cost  economic obsolescence  and the value that could be realized in orderly liquidation 
changes in these estimates could have a material adverse effect on the assessment of our long lived assets  thereby requiring us to write down the assets 
our net long lived assets as of december  and included property and equipment of million and million  respectively  and other identifiable intangible assets of million and million  respectively 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired in business combinations 
we have recorded goodwill in connection with our acquisition of sas in under asc intangibles goodwill and other  goodwill and other intangible 
table of contents assets with indefinite lives are not amortized  but are assigned to reporting units and tested for impairment annually  or whenever there is an impairment indicator 
we assess goodwill impairment indicators quarterly  or more frequently  if a change in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggests the remaining value may not be recoverable 
intangible assets that are not deemed to have an indefinite life are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
the first step of the impairment test for goodwill compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its book value  including goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 
if the fair value is less than the book value  the second step determines the amount of the impairment by comparing the implied fair value of the goodwill with the book value of that goodwill 
an impairment charge is recognized only when the calculated fair value of a reporting unit  including goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  is less than its book value 
we have one segment as operating results are reviewed by our chief operating decision maker  who is our chief executive officer 
he allocates resources and assesses performance at the consolidated level 
in addition  we do not provide discrete financial information for the sas business in regards to overall financial performance review 
we have recorded the goodwill on the books of sas as part of purchase accounting 
we evaluated the impairment of goodwill at the sas entity level and concluded that no impairment exists 
other intangible assets include patents  customer relationships  license agreements and non compete agreements 
the patents include the patents acquired in connection with our purchase of the intellectual property assets of ovion inc they are amortized using the straight line method over their respective estimated useful lives 
see note goodwill and intangible assets in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
debt we account for our convertible senior notes in accordance with asc derivative and hedging asc 
in this regard  our convertible debt and net share settlement feature does not fall under the category of a derivative  and consequently  we classify our long term debt as a liability in our consolidated balance sheet 
our convertible hedge and our outstanding warrants are accounted as set forth by asc  through which we record the convertible hedge transaction and the warrants in additional paid in capital 
subsequent changes in fair value of the agreement are not recognized 
in addition  we account for the cost issuance of debt in accordance with asc interest asc 
consequently  these costs were recognized as an asset and are amortized by periodic charges to income 
asc debt with conversion and other options asc clarifies the accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion  including partial cash settlement 
asc specifies that an issuer of such instruments should separately account for the liability and equity components of the instruments in a manner that reflect the issuer s non convertible debt borrowing rate which interest costs are recognized in subsequent periods 
asc is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and retrospective application is required for all periods presented 
we adopted asc in the first quarter of fiscal the convertible senior notes are classified as current liabilities at december  as the notes are convertible at the option of the holder during the period beginning december  and ending february  contingent liabilities we account for contingencies in accordance with asc contingencies asc 
asc requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency shall be accrued when information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been 
table of contents incurred at the date of the financial statements and when the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
accounting for contingencies such as legal and income tax matters requires us to use our judgment 
we believe that our accruals for these matters are adequate 
nevertheless  the actual loss from a loss contingency might differ from our estimates 
results of operations results compared to in thousands  except percentages years ended december  change amount a amount a net sales gross profit research and development expenses selling  general and administrative expenses total interest and other income expense  net net income b a expressed as a percentage of total net sales 
b net income contains million of net income tax benefit primarily due to recognition of deferred tax assets associated with our us operations 
net sales net sales were million for as compared to million for  representing an increase of approximately million or 
the increase in net sales is the result of continued commercialization and marketing of the essure system worldwide and reflects the increasing numbers of physicians entering and completing training in the use of the procedure 
this increase was negatively impacted by continuing macroeconomic pressures that have contributed to reductions in patient visits to ob gyn physician offices  as well as ongoing competitive product trialing 
international sales comprised of our total sales in and of our total sales in revenue from international sales increased in as compared to the increases in international sales reflect our continued focus on growing our current markets and the expansion into new markets 
international sales were negatively impacted by a stronger us dollar in compared to net sales by geographic region  based on shipping location of our customer  are as follows in thousands  except percentages years ended december  net sales in thousands united states of america france europe other than france other for the years ended december  and  we had no customers that accounted for greater than of our net sales 
no customers had an outstanding accounts receivable balance greater than of our total gross outstanding accounts receivable as of december  one customer accounted for of our total gross outstanding accounts receivable as of december  
table of contents we expect our net sales for to be in the range of approximately million to million  which would represent approximately to change from net sales in we will continue to increase our direct sales force domestically 
we believe our net sales growth in and beyond will be significantly influenced by trends in macro economic conditions both in the united states and abroad  the number of physicians entering and completing training  the improvement in physician utilization rates of the essure procedure  the extent of additional favorable insurance coverage and reimbursement decisions  and our success in achieving patient awareness objectives 
however  as we have noted in risk factors and elsewhere in this report  our expected revenue projections involves many risks  many of which are not entirely within our control 
gross profit cost of goods sold increased by approximately million or to million in as compared to million in this increase was caused by higher volumes of sales 
gross margin in was which represents a slight decrease from gross margin in the decrease in gross margin was due to a change in channel mix characterized by greater international sales with lower average selling prices 
the decrease in gross margin was further impacted due to the acquisition of intellectual property assets  including patents and licenses  of ovion 
in connection with the purchase  ams and ovion released us from any and all current and future domestic and international royalty obligations under such licenses 
as a result  we released approximately million of accrued international royalty obligations that resulted in our gross margins increasing by approximately basis points in the third quarter of our gross profit margin will vary as our sales mix changes 
increases in sales of our devices through distributors in international markets will tend to decrease our overall gross profit margin 
research and development research and development expenses were million in as compared to million in  which represents a decrease of approximately million or 
as a percentage of revenues  research and development expenses for each of and were 
research and development expenses  which include expenditures related to product development  clinical research and regulatory affairs  are substantially related to the ongoing development and associated regulatory approvals of our technology 
our goal is to continue our product enhancements over the coming years  which are intended to result in improved ease of use and clinical performance 
we expect that these expenses will increase as we seek to maintain our leading position in the market for non surgical permanent female birth control 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses for were million as compared to million for  which represents an increase of approximately million or 
as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses for and were and  respectively 
the increase was the result of i payroll related  stock compensation  consulting and recruiting related expenses of approximately million  primarily due to the expansion of the us field sales force  ii an increase of approximately million due to increased personnel and legal fees  iii an increase of approximately million in travel related expenses and iv an increase of approximately million in advertising expenditures primarily for our consumer awareness campaign offset by a decrease of approximately million related to market research 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses in to be comparable to the current year due to comparable recurring expenses offset by increased spending for hiring additional sales professionals to focus on our sales efforts 

table of contents total interest and other income expense  net total interest and other income expense  net for both and was a net expense of approximately million 
interest income for was slightly lower compared to  primarily as a result of lower yields on our invested cash 
the lower interest income was offset by a lower interest expense in as compared to primarily due to the termination of our revolving credit line with ubs 
see note credit line in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in addition we incurred higher foreign exchange losses in provision benefit for income taxes for the year ended december   we recorded million of net income tax benefits primarily due to recognition of deferred tax assets associated with our us operations 
as of december   we had a total valuation allowance of million against our state deferred tax assets  which is attributable to a portion of california net operating losses that are projected to expire prior to utilization 
if the remaining valuation allowance is released in a future period  it will impact our results of operations in the periods such a determination is made 
we have not paid any significant cash income taxes in the united states since inception and we do not expect to pay any significant cash income taxes during in the united states 
going forward  primarily as a result of the recognition of our us deferred tax assets  we will commence the recording of income tax expense at the effective federal and state blended tax rates 
we adopted the provisions of asc  on january  we have not been audited by the internal revenue service or any state income or franchise tax agency 
as of december   our federal returns for the years ended through the current period and most state returns for the years ended through the current period are still open to examination 
the tax returns of sas for the years ended to were examined and closed by the french tax authorities in in addition  all of the net operating losses and research and development credit carryforwards that may be used in future years are still subject to inquiry given that the statute of limitation for these items would begin in the year of the utilization 
the amount of unrecognized tax benefits at december  was approximately million  of which  if ultimately recognized  approximately million would decrease the effective tax rate in the period in which the benefit is recognized 
the remaining amount would be offset by the reversal of related deferred tax assets on which a valuation allowance is placed 
we do not expect our unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly over the next months 
in connection with the adoption of asc  we recognize interest and penalties accrued on any unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense

the increase was primarily the result of continued commercialization and marketing of the essure procedure worldwide and reflected the increased number of physicians who have entered and completed training in the use of the procedure 
the increase also reflected the continuation of our programs aimed at raising consumer awareness of the essure procedure  such as radio  print and television advertising

recent accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb amended the accounting standards for revenue recognition to remove tangible products containing software components and non software components that function together to deliver the product s essential functionality from the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance 
the software revenue recognition guidance was issued to address factors that entities should consider when determining whether the software and non software components of a product function together to deliver the product s essential functionality 
the software revenue recognition updates to the codification will allow revenue arrangements in which software and non software components deliver together a product s essential functionality to follow the multiple deliverable revenue recognition criteria as opposed to the criteria applicable to software revenue recognition 
in addition  the fasb also amended the accounting standards for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements to provide updated guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the deliverables in an arrangement should be separated  and how the consideration should be allocated  require an entity to allocate revenue in an arrangement using estimated selling price esp of deliverables if a vendor does not first have vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of selling price or secondly does not have third party evidence tpe of selling price  and eliminate the use of the residual method and require an entity to allocate revenue using the relative selling price method 
multiple element arrangements 
a multiple element arrangement includes the sale of one or more tangible product offerings with one or more associated services offerings  each of which are individually considered separate units of accounting 
the determination of our units of accounting did not change with the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance and as such we allocate revenue to each element in a multiple element arrangement based upon the relative selling price of each deliverable 
when applying the relative selling price method  we determine the selling price for each deliverable using vsoe of selling price  if it exists  or tpe of selling price 
if neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price exist for a deliverable  we use its best estimate of selling price for that deliverable 
revenue allocated to each element is then recognized when the other revenue recognition criteria are met for each element 
both the above mentioned updates are effective for us from january  and we have elected to apply them prospectively to new or materially modified revenue arrangements after its effective date 
we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and results of operations 

table of contents in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 asc fair value measurements and disclosure requirements  which updated guidance related to fair value measurements and disclosures  and requires a reporting entity to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements and describe the reasons for the transfers 
in addition  in the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs  or level  a reporting entity should disclose separately information about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements that is  on a gross basis rather than one net number 
the updated guidance also requires that and entity should provide fair value measurement disclosures for each class of assets and liabilities and disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and non recurring fair value measurements for level and level fair value measurements 
the updated guidance is effective for interim or annual financial reporting periods beginning after december   except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the roll forward activity in level fair value measurements  which are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and for interim periods within those fiscal years

liquidity and capital resources we have experienced significant cumulative operating losses since inception and  as of december   had an accumulated deficit of million 
although we were profitable in and  we experienced a net loss in we believe that our us operations have achieved a sufficient level of profitability and will sustain a sufficient level of profitability in and beyond 
we will continue to expend substantial resources in research and development  and the selling and marketing of the essure system worldwide 
we will remain in an accumulated deficit position unless sufficient net sales can be generated to offset expenses

the successful achievement of our business objectives may require additional financing and therefore  we may in the future seek to raise additional funds through bank facilities  debt or equity offerings or other sources of capital 
any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
additional funding may not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to us

the notes are convertible into cash and  if applicable  shares of our common stock based on an initial conversion rate  subject to adjustment  of shares per  principal amount of notes which represents an initial conversion price of approximately per share  in certain circumstances 
upon conversion  a holder would receive cash up to the principal amount of the note and our common stock in respect of such note s conversion value in excess of such principal amount 
we may repurchase such securities from time to time

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discusses our exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
interest rate risk we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings  types  and maturities 
the values of our investments are subject to market price volatility 
our primary objective for holding investments is to achieve an appropriate investment return consistent with preserving principal and managing risk 
as of december  we had short and long term available for sale investments of million recorded at fair value 
at any time  a sharp rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio  specifically investments in corporate bonds and us government bonds 
we had no outstanding hedging instruments for our investments as of december  we monitor our interest rate and credit risks  including our credit exposures to specific rating categories and to individual issuers 
we monitor our investment portfolio to ensure it is compliant with our internal investments policy 
we believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong 
there were no impairment charges on our investments for the year ended december  as of december   a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of our available for sale investments 
see note investments in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
foreign currency exchange risk a portion of our net sales are denominated in the euro and the british pound 
to date the foreign currency exchange risk related to british pounds has been minimal due to the relative size of conceptus medical limited 
we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as we translate the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars in consolidation 
if there is a change in foreign currency exchange rates  the translation of the foreign subsidiaries financial statements into us dollars will lead to translation gains or losses which are recorded net as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
we seek to manage our foreign exchange risk through operational means  including managing same currency revenues in relation to same currency expenses  and same currency assets in relation to same currency liabilities 
periodically  during we entered into forward contracts to buy u 
s dollars at fixed intervals in the retail market in an over the counter environment 
as of december   we had foreign currency forward contracts to sell million euros in exchange for million maturing in january through march as of december  these forward contracts are recorded at their fair value of million in other current assets on our condensed consolidated balance sheet 
we have outstanding short term intercompany receivables of million as of december  we expect the changes in the fair value of the intercompany receivables to be materially offset by the changes in the fair value of the forward contracts 
as of december   a potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical percent strengthening in the value of the us dollar euro would be approximately million 
the purpose of these forward contracts is to minimize the risk associated with foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
we have developed a foreign exchange policy to govern our forward contracts 
these foreign currency forward contracts do not qualify as cash flow hedges and all changes in fair value are reported in earnings as part of other income and expenses 
we have not entered into any other types of derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purpose 
our foreign currency forward contract valuation inputs are based on quoted prices and quoted pricing intervals from public data and do not involve management judgment
