overview the corporation is a full service community bank holding company headquartered in moultrie  georgia 
the community of moultrie has been served by the bank since we provide comprehensive financial services to consumer  business and governmental customers  which  in addition to conventional banking products  include a full range of mortgage banking  trust  investment and insurance services 
our primary market area incorporates colquitt county  where we are headquartered  and baker  lowndes  thomas  and worth counties  each contiguous with colquitt county  and the surrounding counties of southwest georgia 
we have five full service banking facilities and seven automated teller machines 
our strategy is to maintain the diversity of our revenue  including both interest and noninterest income through a broad base of business  strengthen our sales and marketing efforts while developing our employees to provide the best possible service to our customers  expand our market share where opportunity exists  and grow outside of our current geographic market either through de novo branching or acquisitions into areas proximate to our current market area 
we believe that investing in sales and marketing in this challenging market will provide us with a competitive advantage 
to that end  we expanded geographically with a new full service banking center in valdosta  georgia that was completed and opened in june of the corporation profitability  like most financial institutions  is dependent to a large extent upon net interest income  which is the difference between the interest received on earning assets and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the corporation earning assets are primarily loans  securities  and short term interest bearing deposits with banks and the interest bearing liabilities are principally customer deposits and borrowings 
net interest income is highly sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates 
for example  after the overnight borrowing rate for banks reached in september of  the federal reserve bank began decreasing it by to a range of to 
this historically low interest rate level has remained unchanged for the period from october through december to address interest rate fluctuations  we manage our balance sheet in an effort to diminish the impact should interest rates suddenly change 
broadening our revenue sources helps to reduce the risk and exposure of our financial results to the impact of changes in interest rates  which are outside of our control 
sources of noninterest income include our insurance agency and empire  the corporation commercial mortgage banking subsidiary  as well as fees on customer accounts  and trust and retail brokerage services 
in  noninterest income was more than of the corporation total revenue  whereas in noninterest income accounted for of the corporation total revenue 
our profitability is impacted also by operating expenses such as salaries  employee benefits  occupancy  and income taxes 
our lending activities are significantly influenced by regional and local factors such as changes in population  competition among lenders  interest rate conditions and prevailing market rates on competing uses of funds and investments  customer preferences and levels of personal income and savings in the corporation primary market area 
the economic downturn continues to challenge our region  however  our strength and stability in the market and our focused efforts enabled us to achieve solid results in we continued to invest in our people and communities  fully aware of the near term impact that would have on earnings 
although the economy is slowly recovering  regulatory burdens continue to outpace growth opportunities 
despite those challenges  we will continue to focus on our customers and believe that our strategic positioning  strong balance sheet and capital levels position us to sustain our franchise  capture market share and build customer loyalty 
although the economy remains sluggish  the corporation nonperforming assets decreased to million at the end of this decrease is primarily due to the settlement of a million loan that was placed on nonaccrual status in critical accounting policies in the course of the corporation normal business activity  management must select and apply many accounting policies and methodologies that lead to the financial results presented in the consolidated financial statements of the corporation 
management considers the accounting policy relating to the allowance for loan losses to be a critical accounting policy because of the uncertainty and subjectivity inherent in estimating the levels of allowance needed to cover probable credit losses within the loan portfolio and the material effect that these estimates have on the corporation results of operations 
we believe that the allowance for loan losses as of december   is adequate  however  under adverse conditions or assumptions  future additions to the allowance may be necessary 
there have been no significant changes in the methods or assumptions used in our accounting policies that would have resulted in material estimates and assumptions changes 
note to the consolidated financial statements provides a description of our significant accounting policies and contributes to the understanding of how our financial performance is reported 
results of operations performance summary although net income remained relatively flat for at million when compared to  there were some significant variations 
net interest income increased thousand primarily as a result of lower interest paid on deposits 
net gain on the sale of securities increased thousand when compared to offsetting this increase was a decrease in service charges on deposit accounts of thousand as well as a thousand provision for market value losses of foreclosed assets 
salaries and employee benefits increased thousand due to increased staff at the valdosta banking center as well as increased contributions to the employee retirement plans compared with the prior year 
offsetting this increase was a decrease in other operating expenses primarily due to lower legal expenses of thousand 
on a per share basis  we had a net income of per diluted share for compared with a net income of per diluted share for net income for was million  an increase of approximately million when compared with a net loss of million in this increase in net income is largely attributable to lower salary and employee benefits of thousand and higher net interest income resulting primarily from lower interest paid on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income was partially offset by a loan loss provision of thousand in net income in was impacted by a million non cash loss related to the impairment of equity securities  a thousand loss at the corporation mortgage banking subsidiary and a fourth quarter charge off of thousand and related loan loss provision of thousand 
on a per share basis  we had a net income of per diluted share for compared with a net loss of per diluted share for we measure our performance on selected key ratios  which are provided for the last three years in the following table caption

net interest income net interest income after provision for loan losses increased thousand  or  to million for when compared with the overall decrease of thousand in total interest expense more than offset the thousand decrease in total interest income 
the corporation recognized a thousand provision for loan losses in compared with thousand in as a result of the current interest rate environment  interest paid on deposits declined by thousand to million at the end of this decline was partially offset by a thousand increase in interest on borrowings 
the average rate paid on average time deposits of million decreased basis points when compared with interest income from investment securities decreased by million mainly due to selling higher yielding mortgage backed securities and corporate notes and reinvesting the proceeds into lower yielding investments 
these sales reflected the repositioning of our investment portfolio to shorten the duration and reduce both credit and interest rate risk 
offsetting this decline was an increase in interest on deposits in other banks of thousand 
when compared with  interest and fees on loans increased by thousand mainly due to an increase in average loans volume of million 
net interest income after the provision for loan losses increased thousand  or  to million for as compared with reduced interest paid on deposits and borrowings of million and thousand  respectively  due to a lower interest rate environment more than offset the million decline in total interest income 
the corporation recognized a thousand provision for loan losses in  compared with a provision for loan losses of thousand in the average rate paid on average time deposits of million decreased basis points compared with interest income from investment securities decreased by million due to a lower average volume of securities of million  and interest on deposits in other banks also decreased by thousand 
interest and fees on loans increased by thousand to million 
net interest margin net interest margin  which is the net return on earning assets  is a key performance ratio for evaluating net interest income 
it is computed by dividing net interest income by average total earning assets 
net interest margin declined basis points to for when compared with net interest margin was for  a basis point increase from in the decline in net interest margin was mainly impacted from securities which were either called  matured  or sold and reinvested into lower yielding securities or overnight balances carried at the federal reserve bank 
partially offsetting this decline in net interest margin were both the decrease in the cost of interest bearing deposits and the impact from growth in average loans and deposits compared with the prior year

uses and sources of funds the corporation  primarily through the bank  acts as a financial intermediary 
as such  our financial condition should be considered in terms of how we manage our sources and uses of funds 
our primary sources of funds are deposits and borrowings 
we invest our funds in assets  and our earning assets are what provide us income 
during  total average assets increased million  or  to million  as compared with the increase in total average assets is primarily attributable to a higher level of investments in average interest bearing deposits with banks of million  and an increase in average total loans of million 
the corporation earning assets  which include loans  investment securities and deposits with banks  averaged million in  a increase from million in while year end balances for both loans and interest bearing deposits with banks were less than the previous year  their average volume continues to increase compared with the prior year averages 
for  average earning assets were comprised of loans  investment securities  and deposit balances with banks 
the ratio of average earning assets to average total assets decreased slightly to for compared with for loans loans are one of the corporation largest earning assets and uses of funds 
because of the importance of loans  most of the other assets and liabilities are managed to accommodate the needs of the loan portfolio

allowance and provision for possible loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of the amount required for probable loan losses in the corporation loan portfolio 
loans  or portions thereof  which are considered to be uncollectible are charged against this allowance and any subsequent recoveries are credited to the allowance 
there can be no assurance that the corporation will not sustain losses in future periods which could be substantial in relation to the size of the allowance for loan losses at december  we have a loan review program in place which provides for the regular examination and evaluation of the risk elements within the loan portfolio 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is regularly evaluated based on the review of all significant loans with particular emphasis on nonaccruing  past due  and other potentially impaired loans that have been identified as possible problems 
the allowance for loan losses was million  or of total loans outstanding  as of december  this level represented a thousand increase from the corresponding year end amount which was of total loans outstanding 
we increased the allowance for loan losses in response to the market and economic environment 
there was a provision for loan losses of thousand in compared with a provision for loan losses of thousand in see part i  item  table loan portfolio of the guide for details of the changes in the allowance for loan losses 
investment securities the investment portfolio serves several important functions for the corporation 
investments in securities are used as a source of income to complement loan demand and to satisfy pledging requirements in the most profitable way possible 
the investment portfolio is a source of liquidity when loan demand exceeds funding availability  and is a vehicle for adjusting balance sheet sensitivity to cushion against adverse rate movements 
our investment policy attempts to provide adequate liquidity by maintaining a portfolio with significant cash flow for reinvestment 
the corporation investment securities represent of our assets and consist largely of us government sponsored pass thru residential mortgage backed securities 
also  the portfolio includes state  county and municipal securities  us treasury notes  and of us government agency notes

at year end  the total investment portfolio increased to million  an increase of million or  compared with million at year end the majority of this increase was due to purchases of million of us government agencies  us government treasuries  us government sponsored residential mortgage backed securities  and municipal securities 
offsetting these purchases were calls and maturities of million of us government agencies and tax free municipals as well as residential mortgage backed securities principal paydowns of approximately million 
additionally  we sold million of longer term residential mortgage backed securities and the remaining million of corporate notes to shorten the duration and reduce credit risk in our portfolio 
these sales resulted in a net gain of thousand 
the average total investment portfolio increased million to million in compared with million for we will continue to actively manage the size  components  and maturity structure of the investment securities portfolio 
future investment strategies will continue to be based on profit objectives  economic conditions  interest rate risk objectives  and balance sheet liquidity demands 
nonperforming assets nonperforming assets are defined as nonaccrual loans  loans that are days past due and still accruing  renegotiated loans  potential problem loans  other than temporarily impaired preferred stock  and property acquired by foreclosure 
the level of nonperforming assets decreased million at year end compared with year end this decrease was primarily due to the sale of foreclosed properties as well as the settlement of a large nonaccrual loan in nonperforming assets were approximately million  or of total assets as of december   compared with million  or of total assets at year end deposits and other interest bearing liabilities our primary source of funds is deposits 
the corporation offers a variety of deposit accounts having a wide range of interest rates and terms 
we rely primarily on competitive pricing policies and customer service to attract and retain these deposits 
in  average deposits increased compared with  from million to million 
this average deposit growth occurred primarily in money market and noninterest bearing deposits 
as of december   the corporation had a total of million in certificates of deposit of  or more 
this was a increase from the million total in we have used borrowings from the federal home loan bank to support our residential mortgage lending activities 
during  the corporation did not borrow or repay any advances from the federal home loan bank 
during  the corporation expects to repay million of the fixed rate advances 
total long term advances with the federal home loan bank were million at december  two of these advances totaling million have convertible options by the issuer to convert the rates to a month libor 
the corporation intends to pay off these advances at the conversion dates 
details on the federal home bank advances are presented in notes and to the financial statements 
liquidity liquidity is managed to assume that the corporation can meet the cash flow requirements of customers who may be either depositors wanting to withdraw their funds or borrowers needing funds to meet their credit needs 
many factors affect the ability to accomplish liquidity objectives successfully 
those factors include the economic environment  our asset liability mix and our overall reputation and credit standing in the marketplace 
in the ordinary course of business  our cash flows are generated from deposits  interest and fee income  loan repayments and the maturity or sale of other earning assets 
the consolidated statement of cash flows details the corporation cash flows from operating  investing  and financing activities 
during  operating and financing activities provided cash flows of million  while investing activities used million resulting in a decrease in cash and cash equivalents balances of million 
liability liquidity represents our ability to renew or replace our short term borrowings and deposits as they mature or are withdrawn 
the corporation deposit mix includes a significant amount of core deposits 
core deposits are defined as total deposits less time deposits of  or more 
these funds are relatively stable because they are generally accounts of individual customers who are concerned not only with rates paid  but with the value of the services they receive  such as efficient operations performed by helpful personnel 
total core deposits were of total deposits on december   compared with in asset liquidity is provided through ordinary business activity  such as cash received from interest and fee payments as well as from maturing loans and investments 
additional sources include marketable securities and short term investments that are easily converted into cash without significant loss 
the corporation had million investment securities maturing within one year or less on december   which represented of the investment debt securities portfolio 
also  the corporation has approximately million of us government agency and state and municipal securities callable at the option of the issuer within one year and approximately million of expected annual cash flow in principal reductions from payments of mortgage backed securities 
due to the current interest rate environment  million of our callable securities were called in and million were called in we have reinvested these proceeds from called investment securities in new loans and new investment securities 
we are not aware of any other known trends  events  or uncertainties that will have or that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the corporation liquidity or operations 
contractual obligations the chart below shows the corporation contractual obligations and its scheduled future cash payments under those obligations as of december  the majority of the corporation outstanding contractual obligations are long term debt 
the remaining contractual obligations are comprised of purchase obligations for data processing services and a rental agreement for our mortgage servicing office

off balance sheet arrangements we are a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk which arise in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit in the form of loans or through letters of credit 
the instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the financial statements 
since many of the commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the contractual amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements

capital resources and dividends our average equity to average assets ratio was in and in the federal reserve board and the fdic have issued rules regarding risk based capital requirements for us banks and bank holding companies 
overall  these guidelines define the components of capital  require higher levels of capital for higher risk assets and lower levels of capital for lower risk assets  and include certain off balance sheet items in the calculation of capital requirements 
the risk based capital regulations require banks to maintain an total risk based ratio  of which must consist primarily of tangible common shareholders equity tier i capital or its equivalent 
also  the regulations require a financial institution to maintain a leverage ratio 
at year end  we were well in excess of the minimum requirements under the guidelines with a total risk based capital ratio of  a tier i risk based capital ratio of  and a leverage ratio of 
to continue to conduct its business as currently conducted  the corporation and the bank will need to maintain capital well above the minimum levels

interest rate sensitivity the corporation most important element of asset liability management is the monitoring of its sensitivity and exposure to interest rate movements which is the corporation primary market risk 
we have no foreign currency exchange rate risk  commodity price risk  or any other material market risk 
the corporation has no trading investment portfolio  nor do we have any interest rate swaps or other derivative instruments 
our primary source of earnings  net interest income  can fluctuate with significant interest rate movements 
to lessen the impact of these movements  we seek to maximize net interest income while remaining within prudent ranges of risk by practicing sound interest rate sensitivity management 
we attempt to accomplish this objective by structuring the balance sheet so that the differences in repricing opportunities between assets and liabilities are minimized 
interest rate sensitivity refers to the responsiveness of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities to changes in market interest rates 
the corporation interest rate risk management is carried out by the asset liability management committee which operates under policies and guidelines established by the bank 
the principal objective of asset liability management is to manage the levels of interest sensitive assets and liabilities to minimize net interest income fluctuations in times of fluctuating market interest rates 
to effectively measure and manage interest rate risk  the corporation uses computer simulations that determine the impact on net interest income of numerous interest rate scenarios  balance sheet trends and strategies 
these simulations cover the following financial instruments short term financial instruments  investment securities  loans  deposits  and borrowings 
these simulations incorporate assumptions about balance sheet dynamics  such as loan and deposit growth and pricing  changes in funding mix  and asset and liability repricing and maturity characteristics 
simulations are run under various interest rate scenarios to determine the impact on net income and capital 
from these computer simulations  interest rate risk is quantified and appropriate strategies are developed and implemented 
the corporation also maintains an investment portfolio which receives monthly cash flows from mortgage backed securities principal payments  and staggered maturities and provides flexibility over time in managing exposure to changes in interest rates 
any imbalances in the repricing opportunities at any point in time constitute a financial institution interest rate sensitivity
